It is widely accepted that knowledge can be a great source of power and success in our lives. One way that knowledge can lead to financial success is through the creation of something tangible. For example, thanks to the invention of the light bulb by Thomas Edison in 1879, he and other inventors were able to make a great financial gain. This knowledge gave Edison the power to discover more technologies and inventions, which, in turn, allowed him to become one of the most successful inventors in history.

Not only did Edison acquire financial success with his inventions, but other inventors and innovators have had the same success in recent years. Take for example the invention of the 3D printer, which has revolutionized the field of manufacturing. Through their knowledge of advanced engineering and usage of the 3D printing technology, inventors have been able to create profitable businesses designing and printing complex products. 

Another way knowledge can lead to financial success is through the power that comes with understanding the way the world works. People who are knowledgeable in a particular field, like finance, business, or marketing, can use their knowledge to their advantage and increase their financial stability. Understanding how the markets work, how a business is structured, and the way people buy and sell products, are all examples of knowledge that can be used to drive financial success.

Ultimately, knowledge is an incredibly powerful tool that can be used in many different ways to create real things, generate financial success, and increase power. For those who invest the time and energy to learn, whether it be through inventing products or understanding how the markets works, knowledge has the potential to lead to many great opportunities.

First impressions have a great power to shape our interactions and relationships with others, in both social contexts and business settings. When meeting someone new, we establish initial thoughts and opinions of that person based on behavior, appearance, and initial interactions. However, these impressions can change drastically after getting to know a person better and seeing multiple sides to their personality and character. 

Personally, I have experienced this change in opinion firsthand. After becoming close friends with one of my colleagues at work, I was able to look past the physical and professional barriers we initially had between us and appreciate the qualities that made them so unique. The same can be said for a friend I made in college. I initially got the impression that this person was cold and unfriendly, however, after continuing to talk and hang out with them, I was able to see the friendly, humorous, and creative person they are. 

In conclusion, it is clear that first impressions can be significantly altered after getting to know someone better, regardless of the environment. My own experience has shown how the best friendships or business relationships may often begin with a completely different impression to the one you are left with.",1

Subject: Support for the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my strong support for the Electoral College and urge you to maintain its existence as the method of choosing the President of the United States. While some argue for a shift to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College is essential in preserving the fairness, certainty of outcome, and representation that our democracy depends on.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. As mentioned in the Office of the Federal Register's text, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College tends to exceed their share of the popular vote. This minimizes the likelihood of disputes over the outcome of the election, as seen in the 2000 election crisis. With the Electoral College, a candidate who wins a slight plurality in a state can still secure a landslide victory in the electoral vote. This provides a clear and decisive result, avoiding the need for run-off elections or prolonged disputes.

Moreover, the Electoral College promotes the idea of an inclusive president for all Americans. Judge Richard A. Posner points out that the Electoral College requires candidates to have trans-regional appeal. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, meaning that candidates must appeal to diverse regions and address the concerns of a variety of communities. This prevents the marginalization of certain regions and ensures that the president represents the interests of all Americans, rather than just those in densely populated areas.

The swing state factor is another crucial advantage of the Electoral College. As mentioned by Judge Posner, the winner-take-all method of allocating electoral votes encourages candidates to focus on toss-up states. This ultimately leads to greater campaign efforts and attention being paid to the concerns of voters in these states. In turn, these voters become more thoughtful and engaged in the electoral process, resulting in a more informed and representative election outcome.

Furthermore, the Electoral College serves to balance the political power between large and small states. Judge Posner explains that while the Senate's mal-apportionment may disadvantage large states, the Electoral College restores some weight to their political influence. Presidential candidates recognize the importance of large states as they provide more electoral votes. This ensures that smaller states do not dominate the election process and guarantees that a candidate must consider the diverse concerns of both large and small states.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the complications and uncertainties that can arise from run-off elections. With the current system, a clear winner can be determined, even if no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. This eliminates the need for run-off elections, which can be time-consuming and divisive.

In conclusion, the Electoral College has proven to be a vital component of our democratic system. It guarantees a certainty of outcome, encourages trans-regional appeal, promotes engagement in swing states, balances power between large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. Abolishing the Electoral College would undermine these principles and potentially lead to a less fair and representative election process. I urge you to consider the numerous advantages provided by the Electoral College and to support its continuance.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I trust that you will carefully consider the importance of upholding the Electoral College.

Sincerely,

"Limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can benefit both individuals and society as a whole. This idea is being adopted in various parts of the world, as it is recognized that car usage is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. By reducing our reliance on cars and finding alternative means of transportation, we can mitigate the environmental impact and improve the quality of life in our communities.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a significant source of these emissions, accounting for 12 percent in Europe and up to 50 percent in some areas in the United States. By decreasing the number of cars on the road, we can decrease the amount of emissions released into the atmosphere. This is particularly important in the fight against climate change and global warming.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can help reduce air pollution. In cities like Paris, where smog has become a serious problem, driving restrictions have been implemented to improve air quality. During a partial driving ban, congestion in the city decreased by 60 percent, and the smog levels started to clear. This demonstrates the positive impact that limiting car usage can have on air pollution and the health of citizens.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of alternative means of transportation. By creating car-free communities, like the one in Vauban, Germany, people are encouraged to walk, bike, or use public transportation instead of relying on their cars. This not only reduces the reliance on fossil fuels but also encourages a more active and healthier lifestyle. Additionally, car-free communities often have stores and amenities within walking distance, reducing the need for long drives to access essential services.

Limiting car usage can also have economic benefits. By reducing the number of cars on the road, congestion is decreased, resulting in shorter commute times and improved efficiency. This, in turn, can positively impact productivity and economic growth. Furthermore, car ownership and maintenance can be costly, and reducing the reliance on cars can free up financial resources for other purposes.

In order to limit car usage effectively, it is important for governments and communities to invest in public transportation infrastructure. This includes expanding and improving public transportation systems, creating bike lanes and pedestrian-friendly roads, and implementing policies that incentivize the use of public transportation. By providing reliable and accessible alternatives to driving, people will be more inclined to leave their cars at home.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages that should be considered. By reducing our reliance on cars, we can decrease greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, promote healthier lifestyles, and stimulate economic growth. It is vital that governments and communities take action to invest in alternative transportation methods and create car-free communities. By doing so, we can build a more sustainable and livable future for ourselves and future generations.",1
"The Importance of Retaining the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to express my support for the retention of the Electoral College in the election of the President of the United States. While I understand that there are arguments in favor of switching to a popular vote system, I firmly believe that the Electoral College is essential in maintaining the integrity and fairness of our presidential elections.

First and foremost, it is important to understand the purpose and history of the Electoral College, as explained by the Office of the Federal Register in their publication ""What Is the Electoral College?"" The Electoral College was established as a compromise between election by Congress and election by popular vote, allowing for an equitable representation of both states and individuals. It consists of 538 electors, with a majority of 270 electoral votes required to elect the President. This system ensures that smaller states have a voice in the election process, preventing larger states from dominating the outcomes. Critics argue that the Electoral College is undemocratic, but its purpose is to protect the interests of all states and promote national unity.

One of the main concerns raised by opponents of the Electoral College is the possibility of a candidate winning the popular vote but losing the presidency, as mentioned in Bradford Plumer's article ""The Indefensible Electoral College."" While this has occurred on rare occasions, it is crucial to note that such cases are infrequent. The current system ensures the certainty of outcome, reducing the likelihood of disputes and confusion. In addition, the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, preventing candidates from focusing solely on highly populated areas and neglecting the concerns of citizens in less populated states. As Judge Richard A. Posner states in his article ""In Defense of the Electoral College,"" this system encourages candidates to campaign throughout the country, thereby promoting inclusivity and preventing regional disengagement.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system protects swing states, as stated by Judge Richard A. Posner. By focusing campaign efforts on toss-up states, candidates must address the concerns and desires of a broader range of voters. This encourages voters in these states to become more engaged and informed about the candidates and their policies. Without the Electoral College, candidates would concentrate their efforts on densely populated urban areas, potentially leaving rural and less populous areas marginalized and unheard.

The Electoral College also provides an important balance of power between large and small states, as highlighted by Judge Richard A. Posner. The system properly acknowledges the constitutional provision of equal representation for each state in the Senate. This prevents candidates from solely targeting large states, making smaller states relevant and their interests considered. It also discourages the need for run-off elections, which could complicate the election process and lead to further polarization within the country.

Although critics argue that the Electoral College disenfranchises voters, particularly in states that are consistently favorable towards one party, it is worth noting that the voter turnout in presidential elections remains high, as explained by Judge Richard A. Posner. Voters understand the significance of expressing their political preference. Furthermore, a popular vote system could result in only highly populated states receiving campaign attention, leaving other states feeling neglected and rendering their voters irrelevant.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system has served our nation well for over two centuries, providing a balance of power, ensuring regional inclusivity, and promoting national unity. It protects the voice of smaller states, encourages trans-regional appeal, and maintains certainty of outcome. While some reforms may be necessary to address certain concerns and make the system more efficient, completely abandoning the Electoral College would undermine the principles and values upon which our democracy was founded.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I trust that you will carefully weigh these arguments in favor of retaining the Electoral College. It is my hope that you will continue to support this important aspect of our democratic process.

Yours sincerely,

"There has been a long-standing debate on whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate. While some believe that competition fosters a sense of drive and ambition in children, others argue that cooperation is a more important skill for them to learn. In my opinion, both are necessary, but cooperation should be given priority over competition.

Firstly, learning to cooperate is essential for children as it teaches them empathy and how to work with others. In today's world, teamwork is becoming increasingly important in every aspect of life. Whether it's school projects or extracurricular activities, children need to learn how to collaborate with others to achieve a common goal. Cooperation also teaches children to respect other people's opinions and ideas, and to compromise when necessary. These skills are crucial in building a harmonious society.

On the other hand, competition can be healthy if it is introduced in a positive way. It can motivate children to work harder and strive for excellence. However, when competition becomes too intense, it can lead to negative consequences such as jealousy, low self-esteem, and even cheating. Therefore, it is important to teach children how to compete in a positive way, where they learn to respect their opponents and the rules of the game.

For instance, in a school setting, children can learn to compete in a positive way by participating in friendly academic contests, sports events, or talent shows. This can help them to develop a sense of pride in their abilities and also learn to handle both winning and losing gracefully. However, it is equally important to teach them that competition is not the only way to succeed, and that sometimes working together can lead to greater success.

In conclusion, both competition and cooperation are important skills for children to learn. However, cooperation should be given priority over competition as it teaches children essential life skills such as empathy, teamwork, and compromise. By teaching children to cooperate first, we can create a more harmonious and equitable society, where everyone is valued for their contribution.

Technology has had a major impact on peoples' lives and the way we go about our daily activities. On the positive side, technology has made peoples lives easier and more efficient. For example, the Internet allows us to connect with friends and family from all over the world, as well as utilized for educational and business purposes. Automation has made it easier for us to complete mundane tasks, such as making calculations and filing paperwork. Technology has also greatly impacted the way we consume and create media, allowing us to access a wealth of information at our fingertips. 

However, technology can also have negative effects. For instance, too much time spent interacting with technology can reduce our communication skills, leading to social isolation and reduced meaningful real life conversations. Advances in technology can create conditions for job displacement and unpaid labor, as companies increasingly rely on automated systems. Technology can also be used for nefarious purposes and can enable mass surveillance and other privacy invasion practices. 

Overall, technology has been a tremendous boon to our lives, but it's important to remember that there are downsides to consider when it comes to its widespread usage.",1
"A healthy lifestyle is a key factor in modern life, and it's no secret that regular exercise and proper nutrition can have a great impact on our physical and mental well-being. But the importance of exercise extends far beyond just maintaining muscle tone or looking good; it has been shown to delay the onset of degenerative diseases such as osteoporosis and dementia, decrease stress levels, improve sleep quality, reduce depression symptoms, increase energy levels, boost brain power and even help with weight management. Exercising regularly doesn't mean you need to commit yourself to an intense routine at the gym every day. Rather than focusing on quantity or intensity for better health benefits, try finding activities that give you joy - like playing tennis with friends or swimming laps in your local pool. It's important to vary up your workout too: try different classes or sports so you don't get bored doing the same thing all the time. This will also ensure that your body gets used to different types of movements which works out more muscles effectively than sticking solely with one type of activity. In addition to exercising often enough throughout the week (which should be around 30 minutes per day), eating right is also vital for staying healthy. Eating balanced meals full of fresh fruits/vegetables paired with lean protein sources like fish/skinless poultry along with whole grains will provide essential nutrients needed for optimal functioning while keeping calories low enough for weight control purposes if necessary. Avoiding processed foods high in saturated fats and sugars helps maintain overall health by preventing spikes in blood sugar levels as well as reducing inflammation-related illnesses caused by free radicals found in these Type 2 unhealthy foods are efficiently absorbed into our bodies when consumed too often).

"On the one hand, it is possible that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years. One reason for this is the increasing popularity of alternative modes of transportation, such as bicycles, electric scooters, and public transit. These options are becoming more accessible and affordable, and many people are choosing them over cars for environmental and health reasons. In addition, the rise of ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft has made it easier for people to get around without owning a car. As these services become more widespread and efficient, more people may choose to rely on them instead of owning their own vehicles.

Another reason why there may be fewer cars in use in twenty years is the development of autonomous vehicles. Self-driving cars have the potential to revolutionize transportation by reducing the need for individual car ownership. Instead, people could simply summon a car when they need it, and the vehicle would drive it'self to their location. This could greatly reduce the number of cars on the road, as well as the amount of space needed for parking.

On the other hand, it is also possible that there will be just as many cars in use in twenty years, if not more. One reason for this is the continued growth of the global population, which will likely lead to more people needing cars to get around. In addition, as developing countries become more affluent, more people will be able to afford cars, leading to an increase in demand.

Another reason why there may not be fewer cars in use in twenty years is the slow pace of change in the automotive industry. While electric and hybrid cars are becoming more common, they still make up a small percentage of the overall market. In addition, many people are still hesitant to switch to electric cars due to concerns about range and charging infrastructure. As a result, it may take longer than twenty years for electric cars to become the dominant form of transportation.

In conclusion, while it is possible that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years, there are also many factors that could lead to the opposite outcome. Ultimately, the future of transportation will depend on a complex interplay of technological, economic, and social factors, and it is difficult to predict with certainty what will happen.

"The importance of the Japanese art of Origami to modern culture cannot be overstated. Origami, which literally translates as “folding paper”, is a traditional craft that has been practiced in Japan for centuries. It requires no tools or special materials; all one needs are some pieces of paper and their own hands! Despite its long history, origami remains relevant today due to its versatility. Origami serves both practical and decorative purposes. From decorations for weddings and other celebrations to everyday objects like tissue holders and gift boxes, origami creations can bring joy into any space. In addition to these uses, origami is gaining popularity among children because it helps with improving their manual dexterity while teaching them patience and skill development - skills they will use throughout life. Even those who don't consider themselves creative find it easy to learn the basics of folding techniques with just a few practice folds!. . Outside of home crafting projects, origami also has important applications in science and engineering fields such as aeronautics engineering where designers have used advanced folding methods in creating new aircraft designs that save on fuel costs due to increased lift capacity from lighter structures made possible by using fewer parts overall than traditional designs require. Other industries including medical research are utilizing similar processes when developing 3D printed organs for potential transplantation surgery or drug delivery devices using smaller cells created via folded shapes within microfluidics research laboratories around the world . Finally, there's the philosophical side of this art form too: while children might appreciate how cool they look after making something out of paper alone (or how satisfyingly challenging it can be) adults get an entirely different experience through meditation-like state induced by folding movement itself; feeling at peace despite being surrounded by chaos brings a unique set of emotions often not experienced elsewhere -- feelings associated with mindfulness practices widely recognized as beneficial stress relievers despite ever changing daily distractions present everywhere nowadays . Overall, this ancient tradition still holds immense value today when

"If you open a textbook, for example a math one used in the past at school, it's quite easy to notice that each theory and concept is followed by a practical example that explains and allows the student to get a better understanding of the cited rule. For example, if a student wants to know how to calculate the area of a circle, he or she can look up the formula and find out how it works. The student can then use this knowledge to solve the problem.

I agree with this statement. I think that students should be taught to think critically and to be able to apply what they learn to real-life situations. However, I do not agree that the best way to teach critical thinking is to have students memorize facts and formulas. In my opinion, students learn best when they are exposed to a wide variety of ideas, concepts, and facts that they can apply to their own lives and the lives of those around them. This is why I believe that a college education should provide students with a broad range of knowledge and skills that can be applied to the real world.

"When discussing progress and the steps that need to be taken to achieve it, it is important to recognize that people will have differing points of view. It is only by engaging in a dialogue of contrasting perspectives that meaningful progress can be made. In this essay, I will discuss why the discussion of contrasting points of view is necessary for progress and provide examples to illustrate my point.

To begin, it is important to note that progress is a complex concept. It involves understanding the underlying problem, considering different solutions, and finding a way to bring those solutions into reality. In order to understand the problem and arrive at the best solution, it is necessary to consider various points of view. Only by taking into account the perspectives of different people can a comprehensive understanding of the issue can be formed.

For example, let's say a community is looking for ways to reduce crime in their area. If the only people consulted are the police force, it is likely that the solutions they propose will be ones that are focused on increasing enforcement and surveillance. However, if people with different perspectives are included in the discussion, such as community members and social workers, they may be able to provide insight into the underlying causes of crime and better solutions to address them. As a result, the police may be able to work with the community to develop programs that are better tailored to the needs of the area, rather than just relying on harsher punishments and surveillance.

In addition, it is also important to consider different points of view in order to build consensus and secure the support necessary to implement solutions. If the discussion is only between people who share the same perspective, it is likely that their solutions will be met with resistance from others who do not share the same point of view. This will make it difficult to move forward with the implementation of the proposed solutions. On the other hand, if different points of view are taken into account, it will be much easier to build consensus and garner the necessary support for the proposed solutions.

For example, if a school district is looking to implement a new curriculum, it is important to consider different perspectives on the issue. If only the teachers are consulted, they may come up with a curriculum that is tailored to their own interests. However, if the students and parents are also included in the discussion, they may be able to provide valuable input on what works best for them and what their needs are. This will make it much easier to develop a curriculum that will be supported by all stakeholders and accepted by the community.

In conclusion, it is clear that progress requires discussion among people who have contrasting points of view. By taking into account different perspectives, it is possible to gain a better understanding of the problem, develop more effective solutions, and build consensus to implement those solutions. Therefore, it is important to recognize the value of dialogue among people with different points of view in order to make meaningful progress.

"The advent of technology has brought a sea change in the way we live, work, and communicate. It has revolutionized the way we think and has made our lives easier in many ways. From smartphones to self-driving cars, technology has become an integral part of our lives. However, there is a growing concern that our reliance on technology may have an adverse impact on our ability to think independently. In my opinion, while technology may play a significant role in shaping our thinking, it cannot replace the power of human judgment and creativity.

One of the ways in which technology may affect our ability to think is by reducing our capacity for critical thinking. With the ability to find answers to almost any question at the click of a button, people may become less inclined to engage in critical thinking, questioning, and analyzing information. Instead of attempting to analyze a problem on their own, people may rely on search engines or artificial intelligence to provide instant solutions. This, in turn, may lead to a decline in our ability to analyze and evaluate information independently, making us more susceptible to misinformation and manipulation.

Moreover, technology may also limit our creativity and problem-solving skills. Working with technology can be addictive and can make us less willing to take risks and be innovative. With technology doing most of the work, people may become less inclined to experiment, take risks, or think outside the box. This can have a detrimental effect on our ability to come up with new ideas or solve problems creatively. In today's fast-paced world, innovation is key to success, and the inability to think creatively can cause people to fall behind.

However, while there are some concerns about the impact of technology on our ability to think, it is important to note that technology can also enhance our thinking abilities in many ways. For example, technology provides us with access to vast amounts of information that we can use to expand our knowledge and understanding of the world. With the internet, we can access books, articles, and other resources that were once inaccessible, which can help us to improve our analytical and critical thinking skills.

Furthermore, technology can also help us to collaborate and communicate with others more effectively. With the internet and various communication tools, we can connect with people from different parts of the world, share ideas, and work together on projects. This can promote creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills, as we learn from each other's perspectives and experiences.

In conclusion, while technology has certainly changed the way we think and work, it is not necessarily a threat to our ability to think for ourselves. While there are concerns that technology may make us overly reliant on it for answers and limit our creativity, it is important to remember that technology can also enhance our thinking abilities by providing us with access to a wealth of information and facilitating collaboration and communication. The key is to strike a balance between using technology as a tool to enhance our thinking and avoiding over-reliance on it to solve problems. Ultimately, it is up to us to use technology wisely and harness it's potential to think creatively and critically.

Making decisions about our future can have a significant impact on the rest of our lives. We can look to many successful people who have made their own decisions and seen the positive impact they have had in their lives. For example, Bill Gates decided to drop out of college and invest his time into starting one of the world’s most successful companies. Whilst this decision was brave and unorthodox, it was essential for him to reach his professional goals. Having the support of family is also incredibly important when making decisions about the future. Not only will it provide an individual with a sense of belonging and emotional security, it will also ensure they stay grounded and make rational decisions. Seeking advice from others is also beneficial; being open-minded and taking diverse perspectives on board can only be a positive thing. Of course, patience is also vital to make sure that our dreams can be gradually achieved over time. In conclusion, making our own decisions and having the support of our family can help to ensure we reach our goals, whilst taking advice from others and exercising patience can also be beneficial.",1
"Senator [Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am a resident and a student in our great state, writing to address an issue that has stirred intense debate over the years, the future of the Electoral College. On careful examination of the facts and arguments for both sides of the issue, I believe that while the Electoral College system has its shortcomings, it should be preserved and not replaced by the popular vote.

Firstly, the Electoral College, as per the federal register, was established as a compromise ensuring that both Congress and the public have a say in the election process. Yes, it isn't thoroughly democratic as the citizen's votes technically go to the electors, not directly impacting the presidential candidate's winning position (Posner). However, these electors are trusted members selected by the political parties, and it is a rarity that they betray their respective parties (Posner).

Secondly, Posner highlights that the winner of the Electoral College often ends up with larger numbers than they would have from a popular vote, due to the winner-take-all system. This system amplifies the winning candidate's victory and provides a distinct outcome. In situations where no candidate secures a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College avoids the need and complication of run-off elections.

While it's worthwhile to take note of the criticism presented by Plumer, such as the electoral college being unfair to the voters in states where the candidates do not campaign, it is also important to consider that the Electoral College system requires candidates to have trans-regional appeal. Therefore, providing better representation of diverse interests across the nation (Posner). This representation allows for inclusivity from all regions, making the president everyone's president regardless of their geographical location.

However, the caveat of the current system makes it possible for a candidate to lose the presidency while winning the popular vote, as seen with Al Gore. And yes, the current system puts enormous weight on swing states, which can seem unfair to voters from safe states.

Despite these criticisms, I firmly believe the Electoral College should be preserved. Why? It provides certainty of outcome, mandates versatility in candidates, balances between regional and national interests, and saves us from potential electoral crises. Simply stitching to a popular vote might seem 'more democratic,' but could lead to its own host of problems and unintended consequences.

As a concerned citizen, I implore you to take these points into consideration as you join larger conversations about this issue. I believe retaining the Electoral College is crucial to ensuring fair elections in our country.

Sincerely,

It is important to understand that it is not beneficial to pair older kids with younger kids. To begin, it can be a dangerous situation for younger kids due to an unfair physical advantage. An older child may use this physical advantage to bully or harm a younger child or put them in dangerous situations without fully understanding the consequences. Secondly, an older child may provide a negative example to the younger child. Older kids may influence a younger child to participate in activities or make decisions that can have long-term effects. Lastly, older kids should respect younger kids and not view them as inferior or expendable -- they should be seen as peers in terms of respect and value. For example, an older kid should not spread rumors or gossip about a younger child, as this can lead to ostracism and other negative effects. Considering the potential dangers, and the need for respect, it is essential that older kids not be paired with younger kids.",1
"There is no single answer to the question of whether or not moving big companies, factories and their employees to the countryside would solve traffic and housing problems in major cities. Some people might agree with this solution, while others might disagree. The following is an argument in favor of this solution.

First, traffic congestion is a major problem in many cities. By moving big companies and their employees to the countryside, this would reduce the number of cars on the road. This would then make it easier for people to get around the city.

Second, many cities are struggling with a housing crisis. The cost of housing is skyrocketing, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for people to find a place to live. If big companies were to move to the countryside, this would free up space in the city and make it easier for people to find a home.

There are, of course, some potential downsides to this solution. For example, it is possible that the quality of life in the countryside would not be as good as in the city. Additionally, it might be difficult for people to get to work if they are living in the countryside.

Overall, I believe that moving big companies, factories and their employees to the countryside would be a good solution to the traffic and housing problems in major cities.

We all have unique personalities and regardless of our similarities, our individual traits are what make us stand out. People can have a bad day for a variety of reasons. Stress, exhaustion, and feeling overwhelmed can all lead to a poor mood. Additionally, some people may struggle with depression or anxiety. It's important to take the time to recognize the reasons why you're feeling stressed or overwhelmed, and tackle the issues head-on. 

First impressions are not necessarily who a person is. People can grow and change over time and they can choose to challenge their first impressions of one another and create deeper relationships. It's important to give people the benefit of the doubt. Spend time getting to know the people you meet and take the time to understand them instead of judging them on a surface level. Together, we can work to prevent snap judgments and build a strong foundation of mutual respect.",1
"There is no denying that modern technology has made life more convenient in many ways. For instance, thanks to technology, we can now communicate with people all over the world in an instant. We can also access a wealth of information at the click of a button.

However, there are also some ways in which life was better when technology was simpler. For one thing, people tended to be more physically active when technology was less advanced. Nowadays, people are more likely to spend their leisure time indoors, in front of a screen. This can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, which can be bad for our health.

Another downside of modern technology is that it can be very distracting. It’s easy to get sucked into our devices and lose track of time. This can make it difficult to focus on tasks and can lead to feelings of anxiety.

In conclusion, there are both positives and negatives to modern technology. It’s important to strike a balance between using technology and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

"Many people believe that children should learn to compete and cooperate in order to have a successful future. There are many reasons why this is thought to be a good idea, and some people believe that children should be taught to compete in order to gain an edge in their field of study. Others believe that children should be taught to cooperate in order to make sure that they are successful in their future endeavors.

There are a few specific examples that show why cooperation is important for children. For example, when children are learning to read, they need to be able to understand the text and make sense of it. This is done by being able to contribute to the group and work together to get the most out of the material. In the same way, children who want to be successful in school need to be able to work together and contribute to the group in order to get the most out of their education.

Overall, I think that children should be taught to compete in order to have a successful future. I think that this is important because it will help them learn how to work together and be successful in their endeavors. I also think that children should be taught to cooperate in order to be successful in their future endeavors. This is important because it will help them learn how to work together and be successful in their endeavors.

"Everything has 2 aspects, so it's not easy to assert something is right or wrong.

What do you think is the best way to live with animals? I think it depends on the situation. For example, if you live in a rural area and you have a lot of animals, you should try to keep them as far away from your house as possible. If you are living in an urban area, then you can keep your animals close to your home, but not so close that they get in the way of your daily life.

"The debate about the use of animal testing in medical research has been raging for decades, and there is no clear-cut answer as to whether it should be acceptable or not. On one hand, people argue that animal testing can help save lives by providing new treatments and cures for diseases more quickly than if humans were tested directly, but on the other hand many feel that using animals to test new drugs and procedures is simply wrong. Despite this controversy though, a closer examination of the subject reveals that while there are some negatives associated with animal testing in medical research, the practice should still be allowed due to its potential benefits. First off, it is worth noting that most tests conducted on animals involve very mild procedures such as giving them small doses of medication or performing blood samples rather than anything extreme like surgical operations. This means pain and suffering are minimized even when tests do cause some level of discomfort for animals involved; additionally scientists put substantial effort into ensuring safety protocols are followed closely so any distress caused is minimized wherever possible. With these safeguards in place it becomes apparent then how valuable animal testing can be – potentially saving countless human lives through providing vital data necessary before clinical trials involving humans can begin. For example numerous important vaccines have been developed thanks largely in part due to data collected from experiments with animals which otherwise would never had happened had those tests not taken place at all – proving just how priceless their contributions can be towards furthering our understanding of medicine today. Furthermore an often-overlooked advantage associated with using animals over direct human experimentation lies within cost savings; costs related to running a single experiment on an animal typically works out cheaper than what might have been required if a patient volunteer was used instead (not least because ethical issues surrounding consent would need resolving first). This then provides resources which could better utilized elsewhere perhaps towards improving existing drug therapies already approved or developing entirely new treatments too - ultimately leading us down paths potentially resulting in life-saving breakthroughs quicker than ever before thought possible.

"As the world continues to try and catch up with modern technology, one industry that has been particularly impacted is the retail sector. With internet shopping becoming more popular and convenient for shoppers all over the globe, physical stores are struggling to remain competitive. This essay will explore how this transition of power from traditional brick-and-mortar stores to online retailers is affecting small business owners who operate within the retail field. The growth of e-commerce has had a major impact on both large stores and smaller businesses alike; as shoppers increasingly head online instead of visiting physical locations in malls or downtown areas. According to recent studies, it was estimated that by 2021 around 95% of purchases would be made through electronic channels such as websites, apps or voice assistants like Amazon Alexa (CNBC). As consumers become more comfortable purchasing everything from groceries to furniture through digital means, local retailers have had no choice but to shift their focus towards web based sales in order to stay afloat financially. However, while larger companies have been able make this change relatively easily due to their access substantial capital reserves and resources they can dedicate towards updating software systems or hiring specialized IT personnel; small business owners don’t always have those same advantages at their disposal which makes transitioning much harder for them. It requires an immense amount of time for these shops’ owners just setting up a website let alone having one with all necessary functions like customer account management system so customers can store their addresses & preferences etcetera (Small Business Resource Center). Additionally many independent retailer lack marketing expertise needed in order attract new customers online since most people tend search on Google before making any purchase decisions (SmallBizTrends). . Undoubtedly some small businesses are taking advantage of various opportunities present in digital marketplaces today ; Indeed platforms such as Etsy allow anyone open a shop without paying any cost upfront which helps level playing field between big brands and individual sellers(Etsy).

"Drivers Should Not Use Cell Phones in Any Capacity While Operating a Vehicle 

In today's society, cell phones have become nearly indispensable for communication and access to information. However, the ubiquitous nature of cell phones has also led to significant risks when used while driving. There are several compelling reasons why drivers should abstain from using cell phones in any way when operating a motor vehicle.

First and foremost, the act of driving requires a person's full attention and focus. Any distraction while driving can potentially lead to accidents that endanger not only the driver but also other people on the road. Talking, texting, or otherwise interacting with a cell phone diverts the driver's eyes from the road as well as their hands from the steering wheel. Even seemingly simple tasks like checking notifications or changing the music can be dangerously distracting at high speeds. 

Scientific studies have shown that driving while using a cell phone reduces reaction times and situational awareness to similar levels as drunk driving. In fact, data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration indicates that cell phone use is a leading factor in car accidents annually. Texting while driving in particular makes a driver 23 times more likely to be involved in a collision. With so much evidence that phones impair driving ability, the risks are simply too high to justify their use behind the wheel.

Allowing any cell phone use also makes it difficult to enforce more restrictive policies against texting or handheld phone conversations. Drivers may claim they were just changing songs or accessing maps when seen on their phones by law enforcement. A total ban creates a clear standard and eliminates loopholes and arguments over what activities are truly ""hands-free."" 

In summary, the dangers of cell phone distractions while driving far outweigh any perceived importance of access to phones. For the safety of all citizens that share the road, drivers must abstain from cell phone use entirely when operating a vehicle. Public safety should be the top priority in deciding responsible policies around this issue.",1
"When one thinks of the Great Lakes, it is hard to imagine that something so vast and powerful could be threatened. But unfortunately, climate change has had a tremendous impact on these beloved freshwater seas in recent decades. Rising temperatures and increased precipitation have led to massive algal blooms, higher levels of nutrient runoff pollution, and more frequent severe storms—all of which threaten human health as well as fish populations. The most acute consequence of climate change on the Great Lakes has been the dramatic increase in algae infestations caused by an influx of phosphorus from agricultural runoff or sewage plants. These infestations create dead zones where oxygen-dependent aquatic life cannot survive; if left unchecked they can also cause widespread damage to entire ecosystems due to their potential for toxic releases into waterways. People may also experience negative health effects when toxins are ingested through contaminated seafood or recreational activities such as swimming and boating in areas with high algal growths. In addition, changes in weather patterns have brought about more extreme weather events like heat waves and floods that can harm fisheries by altering spawning habitats or eliminating food sources needed for survival. Warmer water temperatures can lead to lower dissolved oxygen levels while heavy rains often result in sediment runoff which triggers changes within lake communities by stimulating excessive plant growth while smothering bottom-dwelling creatures essential for maintaining balance among species interactions. The disruption brought about by changing weather patterns also increases water turbidity making it difficult for organisms like zooplankton essential for providing food resources throughout the lakes’ food web to thrive adequately enough sustain other forms of aquatic wildlife dependent upon them as a source energy production too then suddenly collapse when those primary producers are unable longer around anymore either way because everything else needs it all connected together still no matter what happens though right?. Clearly there is much work yet remaining before we come close protecting our precious Great Lakes from future environmental threats posed by global warming but fortunately scientists continue researching solutions both inside out over time suggest

"Limiting car usage has numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. The passages provide examples of communities and cities that have implemented measures to promote alternative transportation and reduce car dependence, and these examples serve as evidence for the benefits of such initiatives.

One major advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in suburban areas where car usage is high. According to the passages, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road and promoting alternative forms of transportation like public transit or cycling, communities can make significant strides in reducing their carbon footprint.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement in air quality. The passages highlight how smog and pollution levels decreased when driving was restricted in Paris and Bogota. These cities experienced a significant decrease in congestion and smog when cars were banned or limited to certain days. This improved air quality has health benefits for residents, as poor air quality can lead to respiratory issues and other health problems.

Limiting car usage also has positive implications for urban planning and city design. The passages mention the concept of ""smart planning,"" where suburbs are designed to be more compact and accessible to public transportation. This includes placing stores and services within walking distance, rather than having them spread out along highways. This type of planning promotes walkability and reduces the need for cars, resulting in more livable and sustainable communities.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. The passages mention how car-free initiatives can lead to the development of alternative transportation infrastructure, such as bike lanes and public transit systems. This can create job opportunities and boost the local economy. Additionally, households that choose to forgo car ownership can save money on car-related expenses like gas, maintenance, and insurance.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, ranging from environmental benefits like reduced greenhouse gas emissions and improved air quality, to improved urban planning and economic benefits. By promoting alternative forms of transportation and implementing measures to reduce car dependence, communities and cities can create more sustainable and livable environments for their residents.",1
"Nowadays, electronic dictionaries (E-dictionaries) have been increasingly popular among students. However, teachers think that the overuse of E-dictionaries might have more disadvantages than advantages for English learning.

There are several reasons why teachers believe that the overuse of E-dictionaries may have more disadvantages than advantages for English learning. One reason is that, like the use of calculator affecting the skill of calculating, reliance on E-dictionaries may lead to the deteriorating of our spelling ability. Another reason is that, since E-dictionaries provide multiple definitions for a word, students may be more likely to choose the wrong definition, which could lead to a misunderstanding of the text. Additionally, using E-dictionaries too often may prevent students from learning how to use a dictionary properly, which is an important skill for English learners.

Despite these potential disadvantages, there are also several reasons why students might find E-dictionaries useful. For example, E-dictionaries are often more up-to-date than traditional dictionaries, and they can provide more information about a word, such as it's origin and usage. Additionally, E-dictionaries can be accessed quickly and easily, which can be helpful when students are working on a writing assignment and need to find a word quickly.

In conclusion, while there are potential disadvantages to relying too heavily on E-dictionaries, there are also several advantages that students can gain from using them. Ultimately, it is up to the individual student to decide whether or not to use an E-dictionary, and teachers should provide students with guidance on how to use E-dictionaries effectively.

"In today's fast-paced world, many people feel stressed and overwhelmed by their work. It is a common belief that work nowadays is more stressful and less leisurely than in the past. I completely agree with this statement, and in this essay, I will provide several reasons to support my opinion.

Firstly, the modern workplace is highly competitive, which puts a lot of pressure on employees. Nowadays, companies are focused on maximizing profits, and they often expect their workers to do more work in less time. This means that employees have to work harder and longer hours, which can lead to burnout and stress-related illnesses. Moreover, job security is becoming less common, and people are often worried about losing their jobs. This creates a stressful working environment that can negatively impact their mental and physical health.

Secondly, technology has dramatically changed the way people work. While technological advancements have made work easier and more efficient, it has also created a culture of constant connectivity. Employees are expected to be available 24/7, and this can create a feeling of being always ""on"". This can lead to stress and anxiety, as people struggle to maintain a work-life balance.

Thirdly, the nature of work has changed, and many people are now engaged in jobs that require high levels of cognitive skills. This means that people are constantly required to think and make decisions, which can lead to mental exhaustion. Moreover, people often have to work in isolation, which can lead to a sense of loneliness and disconnection from others. This can be highly stressful, and it can negatively impact their mental and physical health.

In conclusion, work nowadays is undoubtedly more stressful and less leisurely than in the past. The modern workplace is highly competitive, and employees are expected to work harder and longer hours. Technology has made work more efficient but has also created a culture of constant connectivity. And finally, the nature of work has changed, and many people are now engaged in jobs that require high levels of cognitive skills. This has created a stressful working environment that can negatively impact people's mental and physical health. Therefore, it is crucial to find ways to reduce stress in the workplace and create a healthy work-life balance.

"The Phantom Face on Mars 

Many people see mysteries where there are none. The so-called ""Face on Mars"" is one such case. While its pareidolic shape understandably sparks imaginations, scientific evidence tells us the landform is simply a natural rock formation, not an artifact of aliens. 

Several facts support this conclusion. Firstly, newer photos from 1998 show the face has eroded away over time due to processes like wind erosion. If aliens carved it, why would natural environmental factors wear it down? Its features have changed and faded without purpose or design. Secondly, similar mesa landforms on Mars, devoid of faces, follow the same wind-created patterns as the ""face."" Scientists understand the geological mechanisms that shape rocks into sheer cliffsides and mesas under Martian conditions. The face fits these natural profiles. 

Some argue its symmetrical qualities prove its artificial nature. However, symmetrical rock formations occur throughout our own planet through geologic uplift and weathering alone. Symmetry does not require an intelligent hand. The ""face's"" symmetry has more plausible scientific explanations than alien sculptors. Further, subsequent high resolution images reveal its features are asymmetrical up close, contradicting claims of artificial precision. 

While the human tendency to see faces remains intriguing, extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. No evidence substantiates carved or constructed origins for this mesa. Ultimately, understanding comes through facts, not fantasies. The Face on Mars is best understood as a chance product of ordinary geological processes on another world, not alien visitation. Natural explanations have held up under scientific scrutiny, while alien sculptors remain in the realm of unproven hypothesis. For these compelling reasons, most experts agree the Phantom Face is merely a natural rock formation.",1

"The importance of protecting coral reefs cannot be overstated. They are some of the most biodiverse ecosystems in the world, often providing essential habitats for a variety of marine species including fish, mollusks and crustaceans. Coral reefs also contribute to coastal protection by buffering wave action, promoting shoreline stability and sheltering coastlines from storms and erosion. Unfortunately, however, these underwater formations are facing grave threats due to human activities that can significantly damage their structure or even completely destroy them altogether. One major factor threatening coral reef health is climate change; rising ocean temperatures can cause corals to expel living symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae) from their tissues which results in “coral bleaching” – turning them white as they starve without food sources. This process leaves corals vulnerable to disease leading in many cases to complete death of affected colonies if conditions do not improve quickly enough. In addition acidification caused by increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide has been linked with reduced calcification rates among stony corals resulting in slower growth or even dissolution of structures depending on local water chemistry conditions. Overfishing is another key threat impacting the sustainability of coral reefs; it removes important prey species such as fish that graze on harmful algal blooms keeping these populations under control while simultaneously reducing available food sources for predators like sharks and sea turtles who rely upon them for sustenance. Furthermore bottom trawling used by commercial fisheries causes excessive amounts physical disturbance damaging delicate seabed communities as well as uprooting live organisms like sponges which form important parts within reef systems themselves contributing substantially towards biodiversity and increasing productivity within this environment . . It is thus clear why there needs to be more stringent regulation put into place both nationally and internationally so as better protect our precious coral reefs before further irreversible harm is inflicted upon them or worse still they disappear entirely never again detectable except through memories or photographs taken before any destruction ever occurred at all unfortunately

"When it comes to technology, we have seen an unprecedented amount of advances over the past few decades. The invention and development of artificial intelligence is one such example. Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be defined as machines that are capable of carrying out tasks that would normally require human intelligence or cognitive abilities. AI has had a profound impact on our world—from automating mundane tasks in manufacturing industries, to revolutionizing healthcare by providing diagnostic data with greater accuracy than ever before. In recent years, businesses have begun leveraging AI technologies to improve their operations significantly—increasing efficiency while reducing costs. Banking institutions are utilizing AI-based solutions for fraud prevention, customer service assistance and automated loan approval process; retail companies are using machine learning algorithms for personalization services; and airlines use predictive modeling techniques for maintenance scheduling and route optimization purposes. All these advantages combined make it evident why businesses should consider incorporating AI into their processes—it offers great potential cost savings without sacrificing quality or productivity levels. Yet even with all these improvements brought about by the application of AI in various fields, there remain some ethical concerns regarding its usage in certain scenarios where human decision making is required —for instance when determining whether someone qualifies for social benefits programs or evaluating applications for housing loans etcetera . In such cases relying solely on algorithms may lead to unfair decisions based on biased assumptions which could potentially hurt marginalized individuals disproportionately resulting in further inequality within society at large . Thus it is important to exercise caution while considering utilization of any form of automation so as not to infringe upon basic civil rights , but rather work towards finding balance between implementing efficient technological solutions while also addressing existing socio-economic issues responsibly . Furthermore research needs to be conducted regularly around regulations governing the use of these tools along with public awareness campaigns that focus on encouraging responsible practices among both business owners & users alike . . Overall , although there still exist certain areas where concerns need addressment , artificial intelligence definitely holds multiple opportunities when it comes increasing productivity & efficiency amongst organizations

"In today's fast-paced world, work has become an integral part of our lives. Many people believe that work nowadays is more stressful and less leisurely than in the past. I completely agree with this statement, and in this essay, I will provide specific reasons and examples to support my opinion.

Firstly, the modern work environment is highly competitive, and employees are expected to work longer hours and meet strict deadlines. This leads to increased stress levels and a lack of leisure time. For instance, a recent study conducted by the American Psychological Association found that more than 60% of employees reported feeling stressed at work, and nearly 40% said that their job was negatively affecting their personal life.

Secondly, technological advancements have made work more demanding and less leisurely. With the advent of smartphones and other digital devices, employees are expected to be available 24/7, which means they are unable to switch off from work even during their leisure time. This constant connectivity has led to increased stress levels and a lack of work-life balance.

Finally, the nature of work has changed significantly over the years. In the past, many jobs were manual labor-based, which meant that employees had more physical activity and were able to take breaks throughout the day. However, with the rise of the service sector and desk jobs, employees are required to sit for long periods, which can lead to health problems such as back pain and obesity.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that work nowadays is more stressful and less leisurely than in the past. The competitive work environment, technological advancements, and changing nature of work have all contributed to this trend. It is essential for employers to recognize the negative impact of stress on their employees' health and well-being and take steps to promote a healthy work-life balance.

False praise and hope are powerful tools for educators, as they can instantly boost a student's self-esteem and encourage them to work harder. However, these tools must be used carefully and judiciously, as not all students may respond positively to false praise or hope. False praise, for example, can create false expectations, which can lead to disappointment and feelings of inadequacy or shame. Similarly with hope, it is important to provide only realistic and achievable goals, rather than trying to set unrealistic expectations. 

The best way to build and maintain self-esteem is to promote a sense of deep intrinsic motivation in the student. This is achievable by focusing not just on the outcome, but on the process of learning and striving for something worthwhile. This way, accomplishments and successes become less about achieving a goal and more about propelling the student to learn something new and develop skills and knowledge. At the same time, by nurturing the student's sense of worth and ability to overcome setbacks, educators can help build a strong foundation for self-esteem. 

In conclusion, the best way to build and maintain self-esteem is to focus on helping students develop their intrinsic motivation and sense of worth through learning and striving for something worthwhile. By doing so, educators can foster a lasting sense of self-efficacy and self-esteem that can help them become better learners.",1

One of the biggest problems that students across America face is not enjoying the school lunch offered in the cafeteria. Many students become unenthused with the same meals, and it affects their performance in school. 

After conducting research, it is evident that there are several underlying reasons why students don't like school lunch. Firstly, the quality and the presentation of the food are often subpar; moreover, many school cafeterias lack variety and offer the same selections of meals every day, causing students to develop an aversion to the food. Additionally, the taste is often an issue, as the cafeteria food is usually not very flavorful and for many students, it is not enjoyable to eat. Furthermore, many students are concerned with the nutrition and safety of the cafeteria food.

To make the school cafeteria more appealing to students, the first step is to improve the quality of the food. The menus should be regularly reviewed and changed to make sure that there is enough variety for the students. Schools should also invest in hiring experienced chefs to provide meals that are both nutritious and tasty. Additionally, schools should focus on improving the presentation of the food, as this may make them more attractive and more appetizing to students. Further, schools should also introduce alternative options such as healthier protein bars and smoothies. Finally, parents should be actively involved in the choices being made, as their input is necessary to make the school cafeteria more appetizing and appealing to students.",1

The success of a program in a school can have a significant impact on student relationships, teamwork, and trust. This is especially true when it comes to programs that are designed to foster collaboration and team work. When students are working together towards a common goal, it can lead to relationships that are more collaborative and trusting. Friendships can be formed among students who are part of a successful program, and this relationship can lead to greater collaboration and success outside of the program.

In addition to fostering interpersonal relationships, participating in a program can also encourage teamwork and trust. By working together, students can better communicate their strengths and weaknesses and learn to trust each other. When teams are formed, the value of solidarity and working together towards a common goal increases, allowing everyone to benefit from each other’s unique skills. This trust can carry over to other areas of life and can create a stronger student community.

Finally, participation in a program can also lead to greater self-esteem and confidence. By achieving success as a team, students gain a deeper sense of self-esteem and gain the tools they need to build their team skills and trust in others. This confidence can carry over into other areas of life, such as their relationships with family and friends, or in their abilities inside or outside of the classroom.

"As the world around us continues to change and evolve, so too does the definition of what it means to be successful. Today's society is placing an ever-increasing emphasis on entrepreneurial success, or the ability for individuals to take charge of their own destinies by creating a business from scratch with little more than hard work and dedication. While this type of success has its own appeal, there is something to be said for those who achieve financial stability through regular work rather than a grandiose venture. Furthermore, these successes can often provide much more satisfaction in life if one takes into account all that goes into attaining them. To truly understand how rewarding achieving financial stability through steady employment can be, one must first acknowledge what it entails. This endeavor necessitates discipline and consistency in order to stay afloat financially while simultaneously keeping a job schedule that works best with existing lifestyle needs - both now and potentially further down the line when family obligations are added into the mix. It is not easy; many times balance between responsibilities must be managed carefully as well as time spent networking for new opportunities or improving skills in order to maintain relevance or gain an edge over competitors vying for similar positions. The end result requires adaptability but ultimately offers security; once achieved nearly any future endeavour becomes achievable due to having resources available where otherwise they may have been limited before reaching such levels of fiscal security and prosperity. Beyond just career advancement however lies another component which makes achieving financial stability through consistent work even more satisfying: leaving behind some kind of legacy or being able attain peace within oneself about past decisions made along life’s journey regardless if successful or not at certain points in time leading up until present day conditions were established financially speaking within ones given circumstances . This could take form in different ways depending on individual preferences such as providing greater opportunities for friends/family members whom would benefit greatly from received assistance due prior efforts put forth towards establishing healthier economic foundations via one's regular job endeavors (or lack thereof).

"I believe that the university education is not only to prepare students for employment, but it is also to give students the opportunity to learn about different fields and to develop their skills. For example, a student who attends a university with a business program may learn about accounting and business management. This would give them the opportunity to find a job in a business setting after they graduate, or to start their own business. Additionally, a student who attends a university with a medical program may learn about different medical procedures and how to treat patients. This would give them the opportunity to become a doctor or to work in a hospital after they graduate.

Another function of the university education is to give students the opportunity to learn about different cultures. For example, a student who attends a university with a law program may learn about American law. This would give them the opportunity to work as a lawyer after they graduate, or to become a judge. Additionally, a student who attends a university with a business program may learn about Japanese business practices. This would give them the opportunity to work in a Japanese company after they graduate.

"The Facial Action Coding System is a new technology that can detect human emotions. It's like a computer program that can read your face and know how you're feeling. Some people think it's a good idea to use this technology in classrooms to see how students are feeling. But I don't think it's a good idea.

First of all, it's kind of creepy. Imagine you're sitting in class and the computer is watching your face the whole time. It's like Big Brother is watching you, you know? It's like they're trying to read your mind or something. That's not cool.

And what if the computer gets it wrong? Like, what if it thinks you're mad when you're really just concentrating? Or what if it thinks you're happy when you're really just bored? That could be really embarrassing.

Also, this technology could be used to judge students. Like, if the computer says you're not paying attention, then the teacher might think you're not trying hard enough. Or if it says you're looking sad, then the teacher might think you're not happy in class. That's not fair.

I think it's better to just ask students how they're feeling. Like, a teacher could just ask, ""How's everyone doing today?"" And then we can tell them if we're feeling good or bad. That way, we can talk about it and work it out. It's more personal that way.

So, in conclusion, using the Facial Action Coding System in classrooms is not a good idea. It's creepy, it could be wrong, and it could be used to judge students. Instead, teachers should just ask us how we're feeling and we can talk about it like humans.",1
"Vehicles were invented to help people move around. The first cars were simple and easy to use, and they helped people get around without having to walk. In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.

Some people may argue that this is a good thing, because it will make it easier for people to get around. Others may disagree, because they may find it hard to find a place to park their car. Either way, it is clear that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years.

The drawback to this is that cars will become less useful. They will no longer be able to get around easily, or they may not be able to do so at all. This will make it harder for people to get around, and it could even lead to accidents.

Overall, it is clear that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years. This may not be a bad thing, but it is important to be aware of the potential consequences.

"Animals in captivity have been a source of debate for many years, and one particular species that receives a great deal of attention is the elephant. The issue lies in whether or not these majestic creatures should be kept confined within zoos, circuses, and tourist attractions. On one hand, some people argue that keeping elephants in captivity can be beneficial for both the animal and humans alike—providing an opportunity to observe them up-close while protecting their endangered populations from extinction. Zoos are also able to provide more nutrition than what wild elephants would normally get access to; they are often better managed and given veterinary care on site if needed. Additionally, conservation efforts by breeding programs have seen success over the past few decades. On the other hand, others believe that housing elephants in captivity does more harm than good—keeping these animals away from their natural environments where they can roam freely with their herds and enjoy living as nature intended them to do so. As social animals who require companionship, being alone or having just one or two other individuals with them can lead to mental distress due to isolation; this causes depression which leads further negative effects such as health issues resulting from stress levels being too high for extended periods of time. Furthermore, many experts criticize zoos' limited space size when it comes to caring for elephants properly since this restricts movement which may cause physical problems like arthritis as well as unnatural behaviors such as swaying back and forth due its lack of stimuli available compared to open land where roaming is possible without any boundaries blocking its path. Although there are valid points on both sides surrounding this issue; ultimately it's important to keep our ethical responsibility towards all wildlife at the forefront by considering how our actions affect each individual animal affected - regardless if it be domestic or wild - before making decisions about maintaining practices involving keeping animals locked up against their will no matter how much we think we’re helping them out by doing so simply because we want what’

"Are We Ready for Autonomous Vehicles?. In today's society, we are surrounded by advances in technology that make our lives easier. Autonomous vehicles - or cars and trucks driven by computers rather than humans - could potentially be the next big thing in transportation. This new technology has sparked a debate over whether we are ready for it to become mainstream. On one hand, autonomous vehicles have been proven to reduce accidents caused by human error on the roads and highways. In fact, studies have shown that 94% of all car crashes involve some form of human error such as distracted driving or drunk driving. Eliminating these types of errors with computer-driven automobiles would drastically reduce traffic fatalities across the country. Additionally, fewer collisions mean less time spent stuck in traffic due to accident clean up on roadways; this could save commuters countless hours each year which can then be used more productively elsewhere. . However there are still many unanswered questions about how autonomous vehicles will fit into society when they become more commonplace down the road (no pun intended). For starters, who will be liable if an autonomous vehicle is involved in an accident? Will it be the manufacturer of the car itself? The company responsible for programming its software algorithms? Or perhaps even both parties depending on specific circumstances surrounding any given crash? Furthermore, since autonomous cars rely heavily on sensors like LiDAR and cameras for navigation purposes – what happens if these sensors malfunction or experience technical glitches during operation? These questions must first be answered before introducing self-driving cars onto busy city streets full of pedestrians and cyclists alike. . . On top of safety concerns facing autonmous vehicles is also privacy matters related to their useage. If a person’s car can track their every move via GPS tracking – what kind of data will companies be allowed access to collect from drivers using these kinds devices ? How secure is this data going to stay once collected ? Who owns this information , who has access too it ,

"In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote alternative forms of transportation. This trend can be seen in the examples of Vauban, a German suburb, Paris, and Bogota, Colombia. By limiting car usage, these communities have experienced several advantages, including reduced pollution, improved quality of life, and increased accessibility to public transportation.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions, and this number can go up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By encouraging residents to give up their cars or use them less frequently, these communities are able to significantly lower their carbon footprint. This is particularly important considering the urgent need to combat climate change.

Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to a better quality of life for residents. In Vauban, where cars are generally forbidden, 70% of families do not own cars and 57% sold a car to move to the community. Residents have reported feeling happier and less stressed since giving up their cars. They are able to walk or bike around the community, enjoy the peacefulness of car-free streets, and interact with their neighbors. This sense of community and connection is often lost in car-dependent suburbs.

Furthermore, limiting car usage promotes the use of public transportation and other alternative forms of transportation. In Paris, a partial driving ban was enforced to reduce pollution and congestion. As a result, congestion decreased by 60% and public transit was made free of charge. Bogota, Colombia also implemented a car-free day, during which millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work. These initiatives not only reduce traffic and congestion but also make public transportation more accessible and convenient.

It is worth noting that limiting car usage does not mean completely eliminating cars. In these communities, car ownership is allowed, but there are limited parking spaces available. This encourages residents to use cars as a last resort and prioritize other forms of transportation. It also promotes the idea of sharing vehicles through programs like car-sharing and carpooling, which can further reduce the number of cars on the road.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages. It helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve the quality of life for residents, and increase accessibility to public transportation. The examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota demonstrate the effectiveness of such initiatives in creating more sustainable and livable communities. By embracing smart planning and reducing our dependence on cars, we can work towards a greener and more connected future.",1
"Title: The Benefits of Limiting Car Usage: An Analysis of Global Trends

With the increasing concerns surrounding climate change, pollution, global health, and an overall desire for more sustainable living, societies worldwide are re-evaluating one of the most distinguishing aspects of modern life: car usage. This essay aims to discuss the potential advantages that limitation or even cessation of car usage can bring about by examining real-world examples from Vauban, Germany, Paris, France and Bogotá, Colombia. 

In the German suburb of Vauban, Rosenthal (2009) gives us a glimpse of what a low-car suburb can look like and how its residents thrive without individual vehicle dependence - a lifestyle that just might be the answer to the threat of increasing greenhouse gas emissions and pollution worldwide. The measures taken in Vauban led to 70% of its population giving up car ownership. Furthermore, it shed light on an unexpected advantage: increased peace of mind. A resident confessed leading a much happier life without the constant stress of maintaining and using a car (Rosenthal, 2009).

A partial ban enforced in Paris successfully decreased air pollution and respiratory health hazards by a significant measure, reducing congestion by 60% and bringing under control smog levels which had been akin to highly polluted cities like Beijing (Duffer, 2014). However, it’s important to note the resistance faced by some, as seen in the case of 4000 drivers fined for violation of the ban, suggesting that behavioral and cultural shifts would be an essential part of this transformation.

In Colombia, car-free days have become a cardinal part of public policy, promoting alternative transportation methods, and reducing smog, while massively improving public health. The public participation, as seen in Bogota, suggests better acceptance of such policies, especially when bolstered with improvements in pedestrian spaces and community zones (Selsky, 2002).

In the United States too, an interesting trend has emerged with newer generations driving less, buying fewer cars, and acquiring fewer licenses (Rosenthal, 2013). This cultural shift is indicative of the potential for reduced car-usage, especially when combined with effective policy measures. 

As we move ahead, it's crucial to understand the success of reduced car-reliance isn’t only about changing our transportation choices, but also about reconsidering how we envision our communities. “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg (Rosenthal, 2009). The successful transformation of Vauban, the car-free days of Bogotá, the temporary car ban in Paris, and America's changing driving trends all testify to the feasibility and tangible benefits of a reduced-car world. 

In conclusion, limiting car usage is not merely an environmental issue, but a pathway to sustainable living, improved public health, community building, and rejuvenation of urban spaces. Acceptance and implementation of this change would necessarily involve combined efforts from government, city planners, and citizens. The transition might pose challenges but the benefits are valuable and far-reaching. Redefining mobility holds immense promise for our future.",1
"There are many different opinions on whether education is a life-long process. Some people believe that education is something that should be continuous throughout one's life, while others believe that education is something that can be accomplished in a specific time frame. I believe that education is a life-long process.

One of the main reasons I believe education is a life-long process is because there is always something new to learn. The world is constantly changing and evolving, and new information is being discovered all the time. Even if you think you know everything there is to know about a certain subject, there is always the potential to learn more. Additionally, as you learn new information, you may find that your previous understanding of a subject was inaccurate or incomplete. For example, I recently learned that the Earth is not actually round. I had always been taught that the Earth was a perfect sphere, but it turns out that it is actually an oblate spheroid. If I had not continued learning, I would never have known this new information.

Another reason I believe education is a life-long process is because it is important to keep your mind active and sharp. Just as you need to exercise your body to stay healthy, you need to exercise your mind to stay sharp. Learning new things and expanding your knowledge base can help to keep your mind active and sharp. For example, I have noticed that since I started including more brain-teasing activities in my daily routine, such as puzzles and Sudoku, I have been better able to focus and pay attention.

In conclusion, I believe that education is a life-long process for a variety of reasons. There is always something new to learn, and it is important to keep your mind active and sharp. I think that everyone should make a commitment to lifelong learning in order to stay informed and keep their minds sharp.

"It is often said that knowledge is power, and in the academic world, the acquisition of facts and figures is an important part of the learning process. However, when it comes to the education of students, understanding ideas and concepts is of greater importance than learning facts.

To begin with, understanding ideas and concepts gives students a better understanding of the subject as a whole. For example, if a student is studying biology, they may learn a variety of facts about different organisms. However, it is only by understanding the concepts behind these organisms, such as the role of natural selection in evolution, that the student can gain a deeper understanding of the subject. This understanding is more valuable than simply memorizing facts, as it allows the student to make connections between different areas of the subject and apply their knowledge to real-world situations.

Furthermore, understanding ideas and concepts helps students develop critical thinking skills. By learning to analyse information and draw their own conclusions, students can become more independent in their learning and develop the skills necessary to be successful in their future studies and careers. For instance, a student may be asked to read a text and then provide their own opinion on the topic. In order to do this, they must be able to understand the ideas and concepts presented in the text, and then use this understanding to form their own opinion. This type of critical thinking is more valuable than simply memorizing facts, as it allows the student to think for themselves and make informed decisions.

Finally, understanding ideas and concepts gives students the ability to apply their knowledge in different contexts. For instance, a student may learn about the principles of economics in a classroom setting. However, it is only by understanding the concepts behind these principles, such as supply and demand, that they can apply their knowledge to real-world situations and make informed decisions in their everyday lives. This type of understanding is more valuable than simply memorizing facts, as it allows the student to use their knowledge in a variety of contexts.

In conclusion, it is clear that understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students than learning facts. By understanding the concepts behind the facts, students can gain a deeper understanding of the subject, develop critical thinking skills, and apply their knowledge in different contexts. Therefore, it is essential that students are encouraged to focus on understanding ideas and concepts, rather than simply memorizing facts.

I have always been interested in the field of Psychology. In high school, I had the opportunity to attend a variety of seminars and lectures on the subject and it was one of my greatest sources of inspiration. I am fascinated with the complexity and fascinating human behavior and I am passionate about helping people. Not only does this field provide the opportunity to understand why people think and behave the way they do, but it also offers the potential to help create positive changes in people's lives. In order to pursue this career path, I have been working hard to mature my mind and develop my knowledge and skills that can be applied in this field. Moreover, I have taken the initiative to explore different passions and hobbies that can help me develop a well-rounded personality and be prepared to embark on this journey. With a combination of learning, maturing my mind, and developing my passions, I am confident that I will be able to pursue a career in Psychology.",1
"It is almost universally agreed that the purpose of education is to equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary to lead successful and productive lives. While the memorization of facts is an important part of the learning process, there is a strong consensus among educators and parents that understanding ideas and concepts is even more valuable. I wholeheartedly agree with this assertion and believe that students should place more emphasis on comprehending ideas and concepts than on memorizing facts.

To begin with, understanding ideas and concepts gives students the ability to think critically and analytically. It provides them with the skills to identify patterns, draw logical conclusions, and make informed decisions. This can be invaluable in their future endeavors, as employers increasingly value employees who can think on their feet and solve problems quickly. It also prepares them for higher education, as college courses require a deep understanding of various topics.

Furthermore, understanding ideas and concepts gives students a better appreciation for the world around them. It exposes them to a variety of perspectives and encourages them to consider different points of view. This can be especially beneficial in the increasingly globalized world, as students develop a better understanding of diverse cultures and beliefs. It can also help them better understand and appreciate the nuances of their own culture and beliefs.

Finally, understanding ideas and concepts is an essential part of personal growth and development. It allows students to identify and reflect upon their own values and beliefs, and to explore their own capabilities. This can help them form meaningful relationships, develop healthy habits, and pursue meaningful careers. It can also help them better formulate and pursue their own goals and ambitions.

In conclusion, it is clear that understanding ideas and concepts is far more valuable to students than memorizing facts. It not only prepares them for higher education and future endeavors, but also gives them a better appreciation of the world around them and encourages personal growth and development. Therefore, students should focus more on understanding ideas and concepts than memorizing facts.

"There is no one definitive answer to this question, as people enjoy life in different ways. However, there are a few general reasons why young people may enjoy life more than older people.

First, young people are still in the process of discovering and exploring their own unique talents and abilities. This can be a fun and rewarding process, as it allows them to find their own strengths and weaknesses. As they continue to grow and develop, they may come to appreciate life more fully and appreciate all the unique experiences and moments that life offers.

Second, young people often have more energy and enthusiasm than older people. They are often more engaged in their lives and their surroundings, and they are more likely to be exploring new opportunities and adventures. This can lead to a more vibrant and active lifestyle, which can be enjoyable and rewarding in and of it'self.

Finally, young people often have more optimism and hope for the future. This can be a positive quality, as it can help them to approach life with a positive attitude and outlook.

"The Advantages of Growing Your Own Food. Growing your own food has become an increasingly popular trend in recent years. There are numerous advantages to growing one's own food, from saving money on grocery bills to improving both mental and physical health. From enjoying the freshness of homegrown produce to learning more about conservation practices, there is a range of benefits that come with gardening and harvesting one’s own crops. One major reason why people choose to grow their own food is due to the economic savings they can gain by not having to purchase fruits, vegetables, herbs and other edibles at the store. Gardening has been found to reduce household expenses significantly; those who take the time and effort involved in planting, tending, weeding and harvesting often enjoy fresher produce than what can be bought in a store for less cost overall. In addition, growing one's own food often helps save on transportation costs because locally grown items need not be shipped long distances before reaching consumers' tables. With fewer resources necessary for transporting goods over long distances also comes a reduced environmental footprint — another advantage of gardening that should not be overlooked!. Besides being economical, cultivating plants also offers considerable health benefits since many home gardeners opt for organic or natural methods when it comes their gardens' upkeep. Furthermore, studies have linked regular exposure (and consumption) of green spaces with improved mental well-being — something that could be difficult or impossible without having access or understanding how farming works first-hand. The physical aspect of gardening too brings its rewards in terms of exercise: digging beds; carrying soil amendments; lugging tools around; pulling weeds; pruning branches — all activities which add up throughout each season spent outdoors muscling plants into place require considerable energy expenditure! Gardening provides an excellent way for individuals who might otherwise find exercising tedious or unpleasant a way out given its intrinsically rewarding nature - you get actively healthy while working towards tangible results like improved crop yields as opposed allowing sed

Completing a full four years of high school before moving on to college can help students build essential skills and gain knowledge for their future. For instance, skills such as better time management, organization, writing, and study techniques can be developed over the four year period. This can help students apply these skills to their college courses, eventually translating into better grades and success. 

On the contrary, leaving high school one year earlier than traditional can be challenging. Without the full four-year curriculum, students may lack the exposure to higher level classes needed to perform well in college. Additionally, early graduation can sometimes hinder self-development, as students may miss out on important milestones that could contribute to maturity level and development. 

For example, one student left high school early in order to take a dual-enrollment course at a local college. By not experiencing a full four years of high school, the student lacked the maturity level and knowledge needed to succeed in college academics. As a result, her grades began to suffer.

It is clear that while leaving high school early can be appealing to some, it is important to consider the effects it may have on a student's future. Taking the four year high school experience can help them prepare for the rigors of college by developing crucial skills and knowledge, while also allowing them to build maturity and grow into adulthood.",1
"The influence of technology on communication is an important topic to consider in today's world. Technology has revolutionized how people interact with each other, enabling them to communicate across great distances, and even through time. These advancements have enabled us to bridge gaps that seemed unfathomable before the age of technology. Today, we can send messages and images instantaneously through various digital devices like smartphones or computers, drastically increasing the speed at which we can interact. This ability has allowed us to connect with friends and family no matter where they are located in the world without having a physical presence for a conversation - something that was previously impossible only decades ago.

Subject: In Defense of the Electoral College

Dear [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and to urge you to consider the benefits it provides in our presidential elections. While many argue for a change to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College is a necessary and effective method that upholds the principles of our Founding Fathers.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome in our elections. As stated by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. This system reduces the chances of disputes over the election results and provides a clear winner while maintaining the integrity of the process.

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that every region of our country has a say in electing the president. Unlike a popular vote system, where candidates may focus solely on highly populated areas, the Electoral College requires candidates to have trans-regional appeal. This system ensures that no region, regardless of its size, is overlooked, and encourages candidates to campaign nationwide, ultimately leading to a more representative and inclusive democracy.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it promotes the importance of swing states. In recent elections, we have seen candidates strongly focusing their campaigns on these states, engaging and informing voters. This strategy ensures that the most thoughtful and engaged voters have a greater influence on the outcome of the election. By emphasizing the importance of toss-up states, the Electoral College encourages candidates to address the concerns and needs of a diverse range of Americans.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that larger states receive the attention they deserve. While the Constitution's mal-apportionment of the Senate gives smaller states disproportionate power, the Electoral College helps rebalance this disparity. It allows candidates to earn more electoral votes by winning the popular vote in larger states, ensuring that larger states have a stronger impact on the election outcome.

Lastly, the Electoral College serves to avoid the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College invariably produces a clear winner. This eliminates the complications and costs associated with organizing additional elections and prevents potential instability in the electoral process.

Opponents argue that the Electoral College disenfranchises voters by limiting the impact of individual votes. However, turnout rates in our elections show that voters are motivated to express their political preferences, even if their state is likely to go a certain way. The Electoral College does not deter active participation in the political process but rather ensures that each state's unique interests are represented.

In conclusion, the Electoral College upholds the principles of our Constitution and serves to protect the interests of all Americans. It provides certainty in the outcome of elections, promotes trans-regional appeal, emphasizes the importance of swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and prevents the need for run-off elections. It is a practical system that should be retained to ensure the integrity and fairness of our presidential elections.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter. I trust that you will make an informed decision that takes into account the best interests of our great nation.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"There is no denying that facts are important. They provide the foundation upon which concepts and ideas are built. However, I believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts.

Facts are, by definition, objective and unchanging. They are like building blocks, and they are essential for constructing knowledge. However, once the basic facts have been learned, it is more important for students to focus on understanding ideas and concepts. This is because ideas and concepts are what help us make sense of the world and solve problems.

For example, consider the fact that the earth is round. This is an important fact to know, but it is not as important as understanding the concept of gravity. Once students understand the concept of gravity, they can use that knowledge to solve problems, such as how to launch a satellite into orbit. If they only knew the fact that the earth is round, they would not be able to solve this problem.

Of course, there are some facts that are so important that they must be memorized, such as the periodic table of elements. However, even in this case, it is more important for students to understand the concepts behind the periodic table than to simply memorize the names and symbols of the elements. Once students understand the concepts, they will be able to use that knowledge to solve problems, such as designing new materials or predicting the properties of unknown substances.

In conclusion, while facts are important, I believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts. This is because ideas and concepts are what help us make sense of the world and solve problems.

School is an invaluable opportunity to learn valuable lessons that can stay with us throughout our lives. One of the most important lessons students can learn at school is how to think critically and objectively. Understanding critical thinking can help students develop better problem-solving skills, make more informed decisions, and ultimately contribute to more successful outcomes in their future endeavors.

Critical thinking in the classroom teaches students to think beyond what is being presented to them and to challenge assumptions and ideas. With the help of teachers, students learn how to evaluate various sources of information, identify multiple perspectives on an issue, and weigh the evidence to arrive at a reasonable conclusion. This can make them better informed citizens, better prepared in their jobs, and better able to participate in critical conversations.

Learning how to think critically is also important because it helps us develop our own independent thought processes and strengthen our ability to make our own judgments. It encourages a sense of curiosity and exploration and allows us to better analyze existing data objectively to draw our own conclusions about the world around us. This can help us become more confident and independent learners, which can help us in our future studies and careers.

Ultimately, developing critical thinking skills is an essential life skill that can benefit students in their future. It can help them to better make decisions, more effectively participate in critical conversations, and confidently navigate various challenges they may face in their lives.",1
"The importance of taking regular breaks in the workplace cannot be overstated. Whether it’s a coffee break, lunch or even just to get up and walk around for a few minutes, giving yourself time away from your desk can have many positive benefits both physically and mentally. Physically, regular breaks give your body and eyes the chance to rest after long hours sitting at the computer. Taking short walks throughout the day can help ward off aches and pains associated with extended periods of sitting down. They also allow you to step away from your work so that when you do come back to it, you will have refreshed ideas and more energy for tackling whatever task lies ahead. Additionally, some studies suggest that taking regular breaks may lead to increased productivity overall as well as greater job satisfaction due to feeling less overwhelmed by workloads. . Mentally speaking, taking frequent breaks gives us an opportunity to reset our minds which often helps us approach problems with fresh perspectives that are not clouded by stress or frustration arising from prolonged concentration on difficult tasks. It is during these pauses where we can practice mindfulness techniques such as breathing exercises or meditation which can further help reduce anxiousness while increasing creativity levels resulting in better problem solving skills in high-pressure situations where quick decisions need to be made efficiently without compromising quality output results. . Overall then, incorporating brief but meaningful moments of respite into our daily routines should be regarded as essential components in any successful work environment if employees are expected perform at their best on a consistent basis; whether they are virtual workers operating remotely via laptop computers or office staff who must observe social distancing regulations due physical proximity restrictions caused by current pandemic conditions worldwide .

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Over the years, there has been a growing trend in various parts of the world to limit car usage in order to promote smarter planning, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and create more sustainable communities. This shift in thinking has led to the development of car-free neighborhoods, driving bans due to pollution, and initiatives like car-free days. By limiting car usage, we can experience several benefits that positively impact our environment and overall quality of life.

One major advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. It is widely known that passenger cars are a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, for example, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of these emissions. By reducing our dependency on cars, we can significantly decrease these emissions and contribute to the fight against climate change. This is especially crucial in car-intensive areas in the United States, where cars account for up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions.

In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, limiting car usage has several positive effects on public health. Car-free neighborhoods and initiatives like car-free days create an environment that promotes walking, biking, and the use of public transportation. This active lifestyle helps to combat sedentary behavior and its associated health problems, such as obesity and cardiovascular disease. By encouraging more physical activity, we can improve the overall health and well-being of our communities.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of traffic congestion. Suburbs that are designed with smart planning principles, like Vauban in Germany, have seen a significant decrease in traffic. Without cars on the streets, these neighborhoods become more accessible for pedestrians and cyclists. As a result, there is less congestion and more freedom of movement. This not only saves time for residents but also contributes to a safer and more enjoyable neighborhood environment.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more sustainable and compact communities. By placing stores within walking distance and implementing better public transportation systems, we can reduce the need for long-distance car travel. This new approach to community development allows for more efficient land use and reduces the reliance on cars as the primary mode of transportation. As a result, we can create more livable neighborhoods that prioritize human connection and sustainability.

In conclusion, there are several advantages to limiting car usage. By doing so, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve public health, decrease traffic congestion, and create more sustainable communities. With the growing recognition of the negative impacts of car culture, it is important to embrace alternatives and work towards a future that is less dependent on cars. In doing this, we can create a healthier, greener, and more enjoyable environment for all.",1
"The number of cars in use today is about the same as it was in the early 1900s. However, in the next twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today because the number of cars has been declining steadily since the early 1900s.

There are a number of reasons for this decline. One reason is that the number of cars has been increasing at a rate that is not sustainable. The average car is only able to travel about 30 miles per hour, which is not enough to cover the distance needed to get from one place to another.

Another reason for the decline in the number of cars is that the cars are not being replaced as quickly as they are being replaced. The average car is only able to last about 10 years before it needs to be replaced. This means that the number of cars in use today is not going to be very high in the next twenty years.

"In the wake of our growing concern for the environment and our personal health and wellbeing, it is paramount that we reconsider our reliance on cars. Communities across the globe are showcasing the benefits of restricting automobile usage. These range from creating cleaner environments, promoting healthier lifestyles, reducing traffic congestion, and potentially facilitating an intriguing social dynamic shift away from the car-centered culture.

In Vauban, Germany, for example, residents have embraced a car-free lifestyle out of choice. In this suburban community, car ownership is restricted, with parking spots available only at the periphery and bought separately from the homes at a substantial cost of $40,000 (Rosenthal, Passage 1). This deliberate design has successfully deterred car ownership, with 70 percent of Vauban's residents not owning cars. Notably, residents have reported being happier with the tranquillity that the lack of cars brings (Rosenthal, Passage 1).

Other communities have embraced car-free lifestyles more out of necessity than choice, but with equally beneficial outcomes. In Paris, the government enforced a partial car banning due to extreme smog conditions brought about primarily by vehicular emissions (Duffer, Passage 2). And in Bogota, Colombia, a mandatory “Day Without Cars” resulted in an eerily serene environment (Selsky, Passage 3). The necessity in both these cases perhaps underscores the urgency of our situation. 

More importantly, these measures are not just momentary solutions but could potentially signal a long-term cultural shift. The United States has seen a decrease in car ownership per household, driving mileage per person, as well as a drop in young persons getting licenses (Rosenthal, Passage 4). Alongside this phenomenon, there seems to be a growing acceptance of alternative transportation methods as companies and city authorities invest more in public transportation systems and bike-sharing programs.

Environmental advantages are apparent from these examples of restricted car usage. Reduction in air pollution is an immediate benefit, as seen in the cases of Paris and Bogota, where vehicle restrictions were enforced primarily to combat smog. In the broader context, a global shift away from a car-dominated culture could significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a significant portion of which are attributed to passenger cars (Rosenthal, Passage 1).

Health benefits also come with limiting car usage. In communities like Vauban, bicycles and walking replace cars, encouraging physical activity and fostering healthier lifestyles. Notably, reducing car usage may lessen stress levels, an outcome reported by Vauban’s residents (Rosenthal, Passage 1).

The advantages of limiting car usage are compelling, promoting environmental and personal health benefits alongside a promising cultural shift. This shift represents a move towards more sustainable living and could pave the way to a greener, healthier future. However, wide-scale adoption would require a conscious effort, deliberate planning, and progressive policymaking from governments, communities, and individuals alike. We should, therefore, look towards embracing this shift, phasing out our reliance on cars, and seeking healthier, more sustainable alternatives.",1
"There are a few different ways to look at education. It can be seen as a process that begins when a person is very young and continues throughout their life. It can also be seen as something that happens during a specific period, such as when someone is attending school.

I believe that education is a life-long process. This is because there are always new things to learn. Even if you are not formally attending school, there are always opportunities to learn new things. For example, you can learn new skills from books, online courses, or by working with someone who is more experienced than you.

In addition, I believe that education is a life-long process because it is not always about learning new information. It is also about expanding your understanding of the world and how it works. As you learn new things, you can start to see the world in different ways. This can help you make better decisions in your life.

Overall, I believe that education is a life-long process because it is always possible to learn new things and because it is about more than just learning new information.

"Computer games have become a popular pastime for children in recent years. While some people argue that computer games have produced more negative effects than positive ones on children's physical, intellectual and psychological development, I disagree with this opinion.

First of all, computer games can help children to develop their physical skills. For example, many computer games require players to use their hands to control the characters on the screen. This can help children to improve their hand-eye coordination and fine motor skills. Additionally, some computer games also require players to move their bodies to control the characters. This can help children to exercise and improve their physical fitness.

Second, computer games can also help children to develop their intellectual skills. For example, many computer games require players to think strategically and make decisions quickly. This can help children to improve their problem-solving skills and analytical thinking. Additionally, some computer games also require players to learn new concepts and skills. This can help children to expand their knowledge and understanding.

Finally, computer games can also help children to develop their psychological skills. For example, many computer games require players to interact with other players. This can help children to improve their social skills and communication skills. Additionally, some computer games also require players to manage their emotions and cope with failure. This can help children to develop their emotional intelligence and resilience.

In conclusion, I disagree with the opinion that computer games have produced more negative effects than positive ones on children's physical, intellectual and psychological development. On the contrary, computer games can help children to develop their physical, intellectual and psychological skills. Therefore, instead of preventing children from playing computer games, parents should encourage them to play computer games in a healthy and balanced way.

"There are a few things that can help to make a product seem much better than it actually is. One example is when an advertiser uses exaggerated or false images to make a product seem more attractive or valuable than it actually is. Another example is when an advertiser uses exaggerated or false statements to make a product seem more effective than it actually is.

In general, I believe that exaggerating or false statements can often lead to a product being seen as much better than it actually is. For example, many people believe that caffeine is a good source of energy. However, caffeine is actually a very harmful drug, and can actually cause many problems such as heart disease and stroke. In contrast, many people believe that olive oil is a good source of oil. However, olive oil is actually a very unhealthy oil, and can even be dangerous for your skin.

In conclusion, exaggerating or false statements can often lead to a product being seen as much better than it actually is. This can be dangerous because people may believe that the product is better than it actually is.

"As technology continues to evolve, the way we communicate with each other has drastically changed. Social media is a major influence in our everyday lives and it's hard to imagine life without it. From sharing information about ourselves to connecting with people from all over the world, social media has become an integral part of our culture. However, this increased reliance on technology can also have a negative impact on human interaction. Nowadays, more and more people are choosing digital communication methods over face-to-face interactions when it comes to maintaining relationships or networking. Although online conversations are convenient and can facilitate meaningful connections between individuals who may be far away from each other geographically speaking, there’s something special about genuine physical contact that cannot be replicated through a computer screen or phone call. Studies show that physical contact releases oxytocin—a hormone associated with trust, empathy and emotional bonding—which helps us form strong attachments to one another. Therefore, although digital conversations might provide some basic forms of connection they still lack the intimacy brought by real-life interactions which could lead to future issues concerning mental health problems such as depression or anxiety caused by feeling disconnected from others due to lack of face-to-face contact or social skills development deficits in young adults coming up in an increasingly digital age where communication often takes place over text messages rather than conversations around dinner tables at home . In order for us not only maintain healthy relationships but also ensure proper psychological development within society , I believe we should strive for balance between virtual interaction platforms like social media and traditional means such as meeting up with friends face -to -face . These physical meet ups have proven benefits psychologically beyond just having fun together , providing essential hormones required for building trust as well as strengthening personal bonds among those involved . Thus , while utilizing modern technological advances is important for self improvement , networking opportunities or even work related tasks ; ensuring everyone regularly spends time interacting physically alongside their peers is crucial for overall mental wellbeing .

"There are many reasons why young people enjoy life more than older people do. One reason is that young people are more mobile and have more opportunities to explore the world. They also have a more positive outlook on life and are more likely to believe in the power of positive change.

Another reason why young people enjoy life more is that they are more likely to be engaged in their communities. They are more likely to volunteer, participate in social clubs, and take part in activities that make a difference in the world. This is especially true in countries like the United States, where young people have a high level of engagement with their communities.

Finally, young people are more likely to be happy with their lives. They are more likely to have positive outlooks on life and are more likely to believe in the power of positive change. This makes them more likely to be content and happy with their lives.

"The debate over whether children should learn to compete or cooperate is an ongoing one. While some argue that competition can help prepare children for the real world, others believe that cooperation is the key to success. In my opinion, children should be taught to cooperate rather than compete. In this essay, I will explain my reasoning.

First and foremost, cooperation helps children develop social skills. When children work together, they learn to communicate effectively, share ideas, and compromise. These are essential skills that will serve them well throughout their lives. In contrast, competition can sometimes lead to hostility and resentment between children, which can be detrimental to their social development.

Secondly, cooperation can foster a sense of community and empathy in children. When children learn to work together towards a common goal, they develop a sense of camaraderie and mutual support. They learn to celebrate each other's successes and help each other through obstacles. This fosters a sense of empathy and compassion that is sorely needed in today's world.

Finally, cooperation can lead to better outcomes than competition. When children work together, they can pool their resources and talents to achieve more than they could on their own. In contrast, competition can sometimes lead to a ""winner takes all"" mentality, where the focus is on defeating others rather than achieving a common goal. This can limit creativity and innovation.

To illustrate my point, let's consider a hypothetical example. Imagine two groups of children are given the task of building a tower out of blocks. One group is encouraged to compete against the other, while the other group is encouraged to work together. The competitive group may be more motivated at first, but in the end, their tower will likely be shorter and less stable than the tower built by the cooperative group. The competitive group may have spent more time trying to sabotage each other than focusing on building the tower.

In conclusion, while some argue that children should learn to compete, I believe that cooperation is the better approach. Cooperation helps children develop social skills, empathy, and a sense of community. It also leads to better outcomes than competition. Ultimately, the world needs more cooperation and less competition, and teaching children to work together is a step in the right direction.

Extending the school day could have drastic effects on both the students and the teachers. For students, it could mean added physical and mental fatigue due to the increased time in the classroom. It could be difficult for students to maintain a healthy balance between school and their personal lives. For teachers, the extra hours of work could lead to increases in stress and workload. It is important to consider the implications that an extended school day could have on both the students and the teachers before making a decision. To address any potential issues, it may be necessary to provide additional support, such as extra funding for teacher aid or extended breaks for students. With the right support, the extended school day could be beneficial to all involved.",1
"It is often said that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. While there is some truth to this statement, I disagree with it overall. In fact, I believe that young people are more involved in helping their communities than ever before.

To begin with, young people are more likely to volunteer and take part in community service activities than in the past. This is due to the fact that many schools now require students to complete a certain number of hours of community service in order to graduate. This requirement encourages young people to get involved in their communities and to give back. For example, many high school students volunteer at local food banks, homeless shelters, and other charitable organizations. Additionally, many college students participate in service trips to help those in need in other countries.

Furthermore, young people are more likely to be politically active than in the past. This is due to the fact that many young people are passionate about social justice and are eager to make a difference in their communities. For instance, young people are often at the forefront of movements such as the Black Lives Matter movement and the climate change movement. They are also more likely to vote in elections and to get involved in local politics.

Finally, young people are more likely to use technology to help their communities than in the past. For example, many young people use social media to raise awareness about important issues and to encourage others to get involved in their communities. Additionally, many young people use crowdfunding platforms to raise money for causes that they are passionate about.

In conclusion, I believe that young people are more involved in helping their communities than ever before. They are more likely to volunteer and take part in community service activities, to be politically active, and to use technology to help their communities. Therefore, I disagree with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities.

"The debate over whether a society should prioritize it's own success or the well-being of it's citizens is one that has been discussed for many years. While some may argue that a society should prioritize it's own success, I believe that the well-being of it's citizens should be the primary focus. In my opinion, a society can only truly succeed when it's citizens are able to lead happy, healthy, and prosperous lives. 

For a society to be successful, it is important for it's citizens to feel secure and safe. For it's citizens to feel secure, the government needs to provide adequate resources and services such as healthcare, education, and housing. Research shows that citizens in countries with good quality healthcare and education are more likely to live longer, healthier lives, and have better job opportunities. In contrast, countries with poor social services tend to have higher levels of poverty and crime. Furthermore, a society will only thrive if it's citizens are able to work and participate in the economy. For this to happen, citizens need to have access to employment opportunities, and a safe and supportive work environment. Unless citizens are able to work and make a living, they will not be able to contribute to the development and progress of the society. 

Apart from providing resources and services, a successful society also needs to prioritize the well-being of it's citizens by protecting their rights and freedoms. This includes protecting freedom of expression, allowing citizens to practice their own beliefs and cultures, as well as protecting them from discrimination and violence. Without these basic human rights, citizens would be unable to participate in society and it's development. Additionally, a society should also promote social justice and equality, as this will ensure that all citizens have an equal opportunity to succeed, regardless of race, gender, or class. 

In conclusion, I believe that a society must prioritize the well-being of it's citizens in order to be successful. Providing resources and services, protecting rights and freedoms, and promoting justice and equality are all essential for citizens to lead happy, healthy, and prosperous lives, which are essential for the overall success of a society.

"Senator [Your Senator's Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and spirits. As a concerned and considerate citizen of our state, I write this letter to urge you to consider the continuation of the Electoral College. As outlined in the U.S Constitution, the founding fathers in their wisdom saw it fit to craft this mechanism as a compromise between the popular vote and congress vote (Passage 1). I implore you to uphold this currently embattled institution in lieu of the popular vote.

I acknowledge the arguments in favor of the popular vote. The unfairness of the winner-take-all method in most states and the overly emphasizing on swing states leave some voters feeling unheard (Passage 13). Also, the potential for ""faithless"" electors to defy the popular will or a tie in electoral votes seem to be reasons to abolish the Electoral College (Passage 11). However, the Electoral College continues to serve critical roles in our democracy that can potentially erode with the installment of a popular vote system.

The most compelling argument in favor of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome (Passage 18). It lessens the probability of a dispute over election results, as witnessed in 2000 when disputes over the popular vote did not reflect distinctly in the electoral vote. In addition, it requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, preventing a candidate from being overly popular in a single region and maintaining a balanced political landscape (Passage 19). Furthermore, it accounts for the disproportionate representation in the Senate by giving more weight to bigger states (Passage 21), and it diminishes the requirement for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the popular votes (Passage 22). 

I concede to the fact that the Electoral College system may seem undemocratic, but it ensures a just representation across all states, regardless of their size or population (Passage 15). The U.S. isn't merely a democracy; it's a federalist system where the states, not just the people, need to have a say in the election process. The Electoral College protects this decentralization.

As Senator to our great state of [Your State's Name], I implore you to stand against the wave that seeks to abolish the Electoral College. Uphold the effort to foster regional balance in the electoral system and ensure that candidates seek a broad, nationwide appeal, instead of becoming mere regional favorites. Your work in defending the Electoral College is essential to ensuring that our democracy remains balanced, representative, and prevents an overly amplified voice from populous areas.

Thank you for your service to our state and for taking the time to consider my thoughts on this very crucial issue.

Sincerely,

[Your Full Name]

"The importance of a college education cannot be overstated. The value of an education is becoming increasingly clear in today's world, and having a degree from an accredited institution gives people numerous advantages that they may not have had without one. For example, college graduates often find themselves at the head of the job market with potential employers actively seeking their skills and abilities due to the level of specialized knowledge they possess. Furthermore, those with a college degree are likely to make more money on average than those without one over the course of their career. Attaining a college degree doesn't come easy either; it requires dedication and hard work from the student to succeed in their studies. The rigor and discipline needed for advanced courses can be quite intense, requiring students to stay organized with projects as well as manage their time effectively if classes are taken online or part-time during off-peak hours. Additionally, balancing schoolwork along with possible outside commitments such as family responsibilities or jobs can create its own set of challenges for any student no matter how motivated they may be towards success in academics. In addition to providing economic benefits, higher learning also greatly contributes to personal growth by enabling individuals to become experts in whatever field interests them most through rigorous research and development projects conducted at universities around the globe every day (often leading directly into new job opportunities). Having access to reliable academic resources allows students gain insight into complex topics while networking with likeminded peers provides invaluable support systems both inside and outside class settings which can ultimately lead towards productive collaborations even beyond graduation itself!. Overall then there is much evidence pointing towards highly beneficial returns when investing in tertiary education whether this comes via traditional university study or alternative methods such as internships/apprenticeships within specific industries which provide valuable real world experience regardless - all these avenues have significant potential outcomes that could help anyone reach greater heights professionally while developing valuable life skills along way too!

"When discussing the topic of sustainable farming, it is important to note its impact on both environmental and economic aspects. Sustainable farming practices refer to methods that combine traditional approaches with modern innovations in order to reduce environmental harm while simultaneously increasing efficiency and profitability. The core principle behind sustainable farming is maintaining or improving soil quality while remaining financially viable. This means employing techniques such as crop rotation, cover cropping, intercropping, reduced tillage and integrated pest management that help conserve natural resources like water, air and energy while also creating a healthy environment for crops. Additionally, conservation tillage systems can significantly reduce fuel consumption by minimizing trips across the farm field which cuts down the amount of carbon dioxide emissions released into the atmosphere from tractors and other equipment used for agricultural purposes. Moreover, these systems have resulted in improved soil fertility due to fewer nutrient losses from runoff or wind erosion leading to higher yields over time. In terms of economics, sustainable farming practices produce greater returns than conventional methods by using less labor costs since they require less manpower per acre compared with more intensive processes such as chemical fertilizers or pesticides which are expensive investments up front. Furthermore, increased yields mean larger profits for farmers who adopt more efficient production systems without sacrificing their land’s sustainability over time – something many traditional approaches fail at doing successfully due to excessive use of synthetic inputs which only serve short-term gains but long-term detriment when it comes to depleting essential nutrients from soils faster than they can be replenished naturally through organic matter creation processes like composting etc. . As global populations continue rising each year there is an urgent need for our planet’s agricultural lands to become sustainably managed in order maintain its natural bounty long into future generations so that everyone may benefit both environmentally and economically alike - this makes sustainable agriculture one of humanity's most critical tasks today!

"Education is a fundamental aspect of human life. It is a process that enables individuals to acquire knowledge, skills, and values necessary for their personal and professional development. However, the question of what is more important for students to learn, ideas and concepts or facts, has been a subject of debate for years. While some people argue that students should focus more on learning facts, others believe that understanding ideas and concepts is more crucial. In my opinion, it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. In this essay, I will explain why I hold this view.

Firstly, understanding ideas and concepts enables students to apply their knowledge in various situations. When students learn ideas and concepts, they gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter. They can analyze and evaluate information critically, which allows them to apply their knowledge in different contexts. For example, if a student understands the concept of supply and demand, they can use it to explain market behavior, pricing strategies, and consumer behavior. This knowledge is more valuable than memorizing a list of facts about supply and demand.

Secondly, learning ideas and concepts helps students to develop critical thinking skills. Critical thinking is an essential skill that enables individuals to evaluate information, analyze arguments, and make informed decisions. When students learn ideas and concepts, they are encouraged to think critically and to ask questions. This process helps them to develop analytical skills and to become more independent learners. For instance, when students learn about the scientific method, they are taught to question assumptions, gather evidence, and draw conclusions. These skills are essential for success in any field.

Finally, understanding ideas and concepts helps students to retain information better. When students learn facts, they are often required to memorize a large amount of information. However, this approach does not promote long-term retention of information. On the other hand, when students learn ideas and concepts, they are encouraged to connect information to prior knowledge, which enhances their ability to retain information. For example, if students learn about the concept of photosynthesis, they can relate it to their prior knowledge of plant biology, which helps them to retain the information better.

In conclusion, learning ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts. Understanding ideas and concepts enables students to apply their knowledge in various situations, develop critical thinking skills, and retain information better. While facts are essential, they are only valuable when they are connected to ideas and concepts. Therefore, educators should focus on teaching students ideas and concepts that will enable them to become independent learners and critical thinkers.

"There is no one right way to be successful, as the best way to achieve success depends on what you are looking for and what you are willing to do to obtain it. However, there are some common traits that successful people share, such as being willing to try new things and take risks.

Many successful people have had to overcome considerable obstacles in their journey to success. They have had to work hard, often starting from scratch, and often facing rejection and setbacks. They have had to learn new skills, take on new challenges, and persevere through difficult times.

Successful people are not afraid to change their approach if they believe it will lead to success. They are not afraid to take risks, as they know that sometimes these risks will pay off and sometimes they will not. However, they are always willing to learn from their mistakes and move on.

Some of the most successful people in history have been willing to take risks and try new things. For example, Thomas Edison was a prolific inventor who developed many groundbreaking technologies, but he was also known for his willingness to take risks and try new ideas. Similarly, Bill Gates is one of the richest men in the world and a pioneer in the computer industry, but he is also known for his willingness to take risks and experiment with new ideas.

Successful people are not afraid to change their approach if they believe it will lead to success.

Many successful people have also been known for their intelligence and their ability to think analytically. They are not afraid to ask difficult questions and to challenge conventional wisdom. They are also not afraid to take risks, as they know that sometimes these risks will pay off and sometimes they will not.

However, despite their intelligence and their willingness to take risks, successful people are not always successful. There are many factors that contribute to success, and it is not always easy to achieve success. Successful people are often determined and motivated, but they are not always lucky. They are always willing to work hard, but they are not always able to achieve their goals overnight.

In conclusion, successful people are not afraid to try new things and take risks, as this is one of the key traits that defines them. They are determined and motivated, and they are not always successful, but this is not always due to lack of effort or determination.

"In a world of constant technological advancement and changing societal norms, it is easy to forget about the importance of traditional family values. The commitment to uphold certain cultural beliefs passed down from generation to generation have been proven time and time again as an integral part of what makes a successful society. As such, it is vital that we continue to prioritize these values in our own lives today. Family values such as respect, empathy and understanding are essential for creating strong relationships within families. Respect for one another creates an atmosphere where family members can express their thoughts openly without fear of judgement or criticism. Empathy encourages us to appreciate each other's experiences and perspectives while understanding allows us to better relate with one another despite any differences we may have with one another’s opinions or views on life. In this way, family values serve as the tie that binds all generations together by strengthening communication between them which helps build trust over time. It is also important that these traditional values be respected outside of the home environment so they can be adopted into wider community circles and ultimately become more widely accepted around the world. This is especially true when considering how much emphasis has recently been placed on individualism rather than collective action which has caused many families to drift apart emotionally from each other due lack of shared goals or bonding moments due work commitments or busy schedules. Additionally, teaching children about traditional family values has a number of positive implications ranging from improved mental health outcomes for individuals who practice them regularly, lessening issues related delinquent behaviour among adolescents who understand their obligations towards others in society or increasing academic performance as students learn valuable lessons about problem solving skills through familial interactions at a younger age instead relying solely on digital media sources for advice later in life . All things considered, although technology provides many conveniences which make life easier in certain ways; it cannot replace the beneficial aspects associated with practicing traditional family values outright since those come only through human interaction alone forged by genuine emotional bonds between generations united by passion rather

There are many reasons for this. One reason is that cities are much more efficient and livable than rural areas. Cities have more public transportation, which makes it easy to get around. They also have more restaurants and cafes, which make it easy to get food. Additionally, cities are much more walkable than rural areas. This means that you can get to most places you need to go without having to drive.

"The confluence of technology and art is a fascinating topic. It has long been debated whether or not technology can truly be considered an artistic medium, with some arguing that it lacks the creative impulse of traditional arts like painting and sculpture. However, when looking at the history of mankind’s use of technological tools to create works of beauty, one can see why this argument may be incorrect. Throughout history, from ancient Egypt to modern times, humans have used various technologies - from simple tools to complex machines - in order to produce aesthetically pleasing objects for both utilitarian and aesthetic purposes. In today’s age where digital devices are ubiquitous in everyday life, traditional art forms have seen a resurgence in popularity due to the availability of digital tools such as 3D printing and photo manipulation software which allow users unprecedented levels control over their creations. With these new capabilities for creating artwork come challenges though; how can we ensure that the work created through these means accounts for ethical considerations such as privacy protection? Additionally, one must consider what effects technological advancements will have on traditional modes of artistic expression – will they lead to more creative freedom or simply enable people with greater access to resources?. These questions all point towards an intriguing discussion surrounding creativity within our high-tech world: Are artists better off because they now have access to powerful computing power unavailable before? Does this mean that potential creators no longer need technical knowledge nor experience working with their hands in order gain skills? Or conversely could relying too heavily on automation eliminate certain aspects unique quality found only within handmade pieces crafted by skilled craftsmen?. Whether or not technology should be classified as an “art form” ultimately remains open for debate however there is no doubt that its influence on aesthetics cannot be ignored; it is clear that technology has played a major role throughout human history when it comes expressing ourselves artistically.

"The modern trend of minimalism has been gaining traction in the world of interior design. From the simplicity of Scandinavian-inspired furniture to a return to classic and timeless pieces, this minimalist style has many advantages that are ideal for any space. Minimalist designs tend to focus on open spaces, clean lines, and neutral colors which can help create a sense of calmness and order within an area. This type of minimalism is perfect for those who are looking for a way to declutter their home without sacrificing comfort or aesthetic appeal. Additionally, it uses fewer materials than traditional styles so it can be more affordable as well as eco-friendly. One great thing about minimalist interior design is its versatility – it works equally well with traditional homes or contemporary apartments while still creating visual interest through unique shapes and textures. Furthermore, since there aren't too many items cluttering up a room, each piece becomes much more important – giving homeowners the opportunity to display antiques or other meaningful family heirlooms in an interesting way that still fits with the overall vibe of the space. However, despite its numerous benefits there are also some drawbacks associated with minimalist design due to its limited color palette and lack of “stuff” - people may find it difficult to make sure their house feels warm and inviting if they don't have enough decorative elements present! It's also important not to overdo things either – too little clutter can become almost sterile looking if you're not careful about balancing out your accessories accordingly. In conclusion, though minimalist interior design does require careful consideration when decorating any room in your home - once done correctly it can be both stylish and practical solution for anyone wanting something simple yet sophisticated!

From a small cup to an extra-large mug with all the works, coffee knows no bounds in terms of creativity and flavor. In recent years, specialty coffee shops have become all the rage as people search for their perfect cup. For this reason, cold brew has become increasingly popular amongst dedicated java drinkers. Cold brew is made by steeping freshly ground coffee beans in cold water for 12-24 hours before straining out the grounds. The result? A silky smooth cup of non-acidic goodness that’s incredibly rich in flavor! Compared to regular brewed coffee which can turn bitter over time due to oxidation, cold brew tastes delicious even when it sits out for a while – making it ideal for busy mornings or lazy afternoons spent lounging at home or relaxing outdoors on a patio (or balcony!). Cold brew also contains more caffeine than other types of brewed coffees so you’ll definitely be able to stay alert throughout your day – whether you plan on studying or tackling some intense tasks at work!. One great thing about cold brew is how versatile it can be - add milk and honey if you want something sweet; use espresso beans instead of regular roasted ones if you need some serious stimulation; mix up fruity flavors like strawberry basil or blueberry ginger if you're feeling adventurous; get creative with toppings such as orange slices or chocolate curls - possibilities are endless! And who doesn't love combining two awesome things into one amazing drink? Think ""iced mochas"" (coldbrew + cocoa) - so delicious and convenient when all ingredients are prepped ahead of time!. No matter why someone enjoys drinking coffee, there's no denying that coldbrew adds an extra level of sophistication: from its unique brewing process to its smooth taste and energizing kick - every sip will bring joy regardless what kind

"History has long been regarded as a valuable tool for teaching about the past. The study of history provides us with a greater understanding of why certain events occurred in the past, as well as how they may have shaped our present-day lives. In addition, the study of history can provide us with valuable insights into human nature, allowing us to understand why people behave and think the way that they do. Furthermore, the study of history can help us to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past, and can also be used to better understand our own culture, society, and values. 

However, one of the main benefits of the study of history is that it can help to dispel the illusion that people living now are significantly different from people who lived in earlier times. This is because by studying history, we can observe how many of the same issues, events, and people have appeared throughout history. For example, many of the key figures in the French Revolution were idealists who were fighting for freedom — a sentiment shared by people in more modern times, such as those involved in the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Similarly, we can look at the history of conflict between nations to see how different countries have fought against each other for centuries, and observe how some of these differences still affect us today.

In addition, the study of history can also help to dispel the illusion that people living now are significantly different from people who lived in earlier times by demonstrating how many of the same social and cultural norms have been in existence for centuries. For instance, the principles of freedom, democracy, and justice have been central to many societies throughout history, and continue to be important elements of our own lives today. Similarly, the values of loyalty, respect, and self-sacrifice have been part of human culture for generations, and remain essential components of our own beliefs and behaviour. 

Finally, the study of history can be used to help us make sense of our own lives, as well as those of our ancestors. By examining how our ancestors lived and the decisions that they made, we can better understand why things are the way they are today, and can gain valuable insight into how we should approach our own lives. Furthermore, by looking at the successes and failures of the past, we can learn valuable lessons which can inform our own decisions, and can better prepare us for any challenges that we may face in the future.

In conclusion, the study of history can be a valuable tool for teaching about the past, and can also be used to dispel the illusion that people living now are significantly different from people who lived in earlier times. By examining the events, people, and values of the past, we can gain a greater understanding of why things are the way they are today, and can also learn important lessons which can help to inform our own decisions and actions.

"In today's world, there is no doubt that technology is increasingly becoming a more integral part of our everyday lives. From phones to computers and tablets to virtual reality systems, it seems as if the possibilities for technological advances are endless. As such, many people have begun to ponder the effects that this expansive access to modern technology can have on our society and culture. One particular area in which it has been greatly discussed is its influence over education – specifically how students learn information within the classroom setting. As programs become ever more embedded into lessons, students are given an unprecedented level of autonomy when engaging with course materials and developing their understanding of specific topics; all from the comfort of their own homes or even during class itself through interactive activities or online platforms like Google Classroom. This creates both opportunities for deeper engagement with subject matter but also potential challenges associated with self-discipline, focus and organization when working independently outside of instructor guidance. To better understand these implications, we need look no further than recent studies conducted by leading educational organizations exploring how technologies shape student learning habits and outcomes in classrooms across grade levels around the globe. Results indicate that while tech may boost performance in certain areas such as problem solving (as seen in math scores), other subjects like reading comprehension may suffer due to distraction caused by digital devices invading traditional teaching methods (such as lectures). With this knowledge at hand, educators must be sure they prioritize proper integration techniques when utilizing new technologies while ensuring any drawbacks do not outweigh potential benefits derived from usage overall; a task made possible only through effective communication between teachers and administrators alike about best practices for implementation moving forward. No matter what form it takes though — whether it’s lecture slideshows powered by Microsoft PowerPoint or gaming software designed for language arts instruction — one thing remains clear: embracing technology within school settings can prove challenging yet rewarding depending on its usage case-by-case basis offering unique advantages along with some drawbacks too.

"English is an incredibly important language for Chinese learners, and it can be difficult to decide which skill to prioritize. Some people believe that reading should be given greater focus, while others feel that speaking should be prioritized. In my opinion, speaking should take precedence, as it is the most effective way to learn the language.

First and foremost, the ability to speak English is essential for communication. In a world that is becoming increasingly interconnected, speaking English can open up many new opportunities. For instance, many Chinese students go abroad to study and they need to be able to communicate with their peers in English. Furthermore, English is the international language used in business, and Chinese students may need to be able to speak it when negotiating deals or attending meetings. Thus, it is clear that the ability to speak English fluently is vitally important.

Second, speaking is the best way to learn the language. Reading is a great way to learn new words and gain knowledge of grammar and sentence structure. However, speaking is the best way to use words and grammar in context. Through speaking, learners can become more comfortable with the language and learn how to use it in everyday situations. It is much easier to remember words and phrases when they are used in conversation. Furthermore, speaking can help learners become more confident in their ability to communicate in English.

Finally, speaking English can be very enjoyable. Learners can use the language to make friends from different countries and learn about different cultures. It can also be enjoyable to watch movies and listen to music in English. Speaking English can be a great way for learners to have fun and gain a better understanding of the language.

In conclusion, I believe that speaking should take precedence over reading when it comes to learning English. Not only is it essential for communicating with people around the world, but it is also the best way to learn the language and have fun while doing so.

It is widely accepted that having a positive attitude helps individuals to achieve success. It enables us overcome any obstacles that may stand in our path and push us to our full potential; however, success is not exclusively dependent on having a positive attitude. Even with a positive outlook, success is not always guaranteed. It is important to allow ourselves to feel negative emotions and understand that the fullest potential of success cannot be reached without recognizing our insecurities, doubts, and fears. 

One beneficial strategy to maintain positivity when surrounded by negativity is to take a break and focus on something else that brings us pleasure. Finding simple activities that can be enjoyed in our own time can help to temporarily take our minds away from our worries and stressors. Furthermore, having a positive attitude can help us discover our passions and achieve our personal objectives, as we recognize the opportunities and meaningful objectives that each day has to offer. Finally, being surrounded with positive influences and supportive friends and family can help to reinforce our positive outlook and provide us with the optimism and belief of achieving success.",1

Subject: In Favor of Keeping the Electoral College

Dear [Senator's Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College in our presidential elections. The Electoral College, as a compromise between election by Congress and popular vote, has served our nation well and should be upheld for several reasons.

First, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome, reducing the likelihood of a dispute over the election results. As stated by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College always exceeds their popular vote share. With the winner-take-all system in most states, even a slight plurality in a state results in a significant electoral vote victory. Thus, while a tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible, it is highly unlikely.

Second, the Electoral College promotes a sense of unity by requiring presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. As Posner argues, no region in the country has enough electoral votes to elect a president. Consequently, candidates with only regional appeal are unlikely to be successful. This system ensures that the president represents and is accountable to the interests of various regions rather than just a specific region.

Third, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states, ensuring that voters in those states have a significant say in the election. Swing states receive more attention from candidates, leading to more informed and engaged voters. This is crucial in our democracy, as the most thoughtful voters, who pay attention to the competing candidates, should be the ones to decide the election.

Fourth, the Electoral College balances the political power of large and small states. The allocation of electoral votes provides greater weight to large states in proportion to their population, as smaller states typically have a minimum of three electoral votes. This addresses the mal-apportionment of the Senate, ensuring that the interests of both large and small states are taken into account.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections, simplifying the presidential election process. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, as seen in the examples of Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992, the Electoral College still produces a clear winner. This avoids the complications and pressures associated with run-off elections.

While some argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states dominated by one party, it is important to note that voters in presidential elections express their political preference rather than thinking that a single vote may decide the election. Despite this knowledge, approximately half of the eligible American population still chose to vote in the 2012 election.

In conclusion, the Electoral College has proven to be a valuable compromise that ensures certainty of outcome, promotes unity, empowers swing states, balances the political power of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. It is essential for preserving the integrity and effectiveness of our democratic system. I urge you to consider these points when deciding on any potential changes to our election process.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I appreciate your dedication to serving our state and our country. I look forward to seeing your continued support for our democratic principles.

Sincerely,

"Dear Senator, 

I am writing to you today to express my view that the United States should change from the Electoral College system to electing the president by popular vote. While the Electoral College was devised with the intention of giving smaller states more influence in presidential elections, I believe the popular vote system would be fairer and more democratic.

One argument made in favor of keeping the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and campaign in more states. However, research shows that candidates under the current system focus their attention only on swing states that could vote either way. With a popular vote, candidates would have to appeal to a broad range of voters across the entire nation, not just a handful of swing states. This would make the process more democratic. 

It is also argued that without the Electoral College, candidates might just focus on dense population centers. However, in reality every vote would count equally under a popular vote. A candidate would gain votes from rural areas just as in cities, since the goal is to receive the most total votes nationwide rather than in certain states. Some also say a popular vote could reduce the influence of smaller states. But in fact candidates would still try to appeal to voters across all states, large and small, to receive a majority of votes total.

A further issue with the Electoral College is that it can result in a president being elected despite losing the nationwide popular vote. This has occurred a few times in history and creates a perception that the candidate with fewer total votes can still win. A popular vote would avoid this undemocratic outcome and ensure that every citizen's vote carries the same weight. It would make clear that the president is chosen by the will of the American public overall.

For these reasons, I believe the United States should transition to a popular vote system for electing the president. It would make the process more representative and give all Americans an equal say, regardless of what state they live in. I hope you will consider supporting a change to better uphold democratic principles. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

"As China continues to grow as a global power, the importance of English proficiency for Chinese citizens has become increasingly recognized. However, there is a debate over which skill of English is more important for Chinese learners: reading or speaking. In my opinion, while reading is undoubtedly an essential skill, speaking is ultimately more critical for Chinese learners.

Firstly, the ability to speak English is essential for effective communication. Many Chinese learners are able to read and write English at a high level, but struggle to speak fluently. This can cause problems in both personal and professional settings, as clear communication is crucial for success. For example, a Chinese businessperson negotiating with an English-speaking partner would need to be able to communicate effectively in order to reach an agreement. Furthermore, speaking English can help Chinese speakers to form connections with people from other cultures, which can be incredibly valuable in today's globalized world.

Secondly, speaking develops other important skills such as confidence, critical thinking, and creativity. When speaking in English, Chinese learners must think on their feet, responding to questions or comments in real-time. This requires critical thinking skills to assess the situation and come up with an appropriate response. Additionally, speaking develops creativity as learners must find ways to express their ideas and emotions in a different language, often using idiomatic expressions and metaphors. This can be a fun and rewarding process, helping learners to develop their own unique voice in English.

Of course, reading is still an important skill for Chinese learners, as it allows them to access a vast array of knowledge and information in English. However, I believe that speaking should be given priority, as it is the skill that will enable Chinese learners to truly engage with English-speaking cultures and communities. By speaking English fluently, Chinese learners can unlock a world of opportunities and enrich their personal and professional lives.

In conclusion, while both reading and speaking are important skills for Chinese learners of English, speaking should be given priority. Speaking enables effective communication, develops critical thinking and creativity, and facilitates connections with people from other cultures. By prioritizing speaking, Chinese learners can unlock a world of opportunities and enrich their lives both personally and professionally.

"The welfare of children is a primary concern in any society. Governments around the world have a responsibility to provide services and programs that meet the needs of their citizens, both young and old. A key question is whether more of these social programs should be devoted to children than to adults. In my opinion, national governments should prioritize their social programs and services to children over adults.

Children are the most vulnerable members of society, with limited legal rights and no established economic power. In comparison, adults have greater abilities in terms of decision-making and financial independence. This means that they are in a better position to take care of their own needs and interests. For this reason, governments should prioritize services that directly aid children. Such services could include free or affordable healthcare, school lunch programs, and youth recreation centers.

Additionally, investing in children’s social programs and services can have long-term benefits for society. Research indicates that children who have access to quality educational and health services are more likely to become productive citizens and successful adults. This means that investing in children’s services can help create a better, more successful society for the future. Furthermore, this can lead to economic savings in the long run, as fewer resources will be required to deal with the problems that are caused by poverty and neglect.

On the other hand, adults can still benefit from some programs and services. For example, governments can provide access to affordable housing, job training, and mental health services. Such programs can help adults become more self-sufficient and benefit society as a whole. Nevertheless, these types of services should be secondary to those that directly benefit children.

In conclusion, I believe that national governments should prioritize their social programs and services to children over adults. Children are the most vulnerable members of society, and investing in their wellbeing can have long-term benefits for society. Adults can still benefit from some programs, but these should be secondary to those that directly benefit children. By focusing on children’s needs, governments can ensure a brighter future for all.

"When peoples ask for advice, they somtimes talk to more than one person. This is a good thing to do because it can help them make a beter choise. For example, if someones asking for advice on what kind of dog to get, they might talk to a few differnt peoples who have dogs. One person might say that golden retrievers are the best, but another person might say that labradors are better. This helps the person making the desision because they can hear different opions and decide which one is beter for them.

Another reason why seeking multipe opions is good is because it can help you avoiid making a mistakes. If you only ask one person for advice, they might have a bias or not know enought about the subjet. But if you ask a few peoples, you can get a more well-ronded understanding of the situasion and make a more informed desision.

In conclusion, seeking multipe opions is a good way to make a beter choise. It can help you avoiid making a mistakes and get a more well-ronded understanding of the situasion. So, the next time you need advice, don't be affraid to ask a few differnt peoples what they think.",1
"The rise of virtual reality in the gaming industry has been nothing short of remarkable. In only a few years, it has become one of the most popular forms of entertainment for gamers all around the world. With its immersive and interactive environment, virtual reality (VR) offers an incredibly unique experience that traditional video games simply cannot match. At its core, VR consists of a headset with two lenses that enable players to interact with computer-generated 3D environments as if they were actually there. Players can move their heads around to look at different aspects within the game or use controllers to perform various tasks depending on what type of game they are playing. VR also incorporates sound design, so users can not only see but feel like they are inside this imaginary world completely surrounded by 360 degrees vision and audio cues which make them feel even more immersed in the digital space .

Recent studies suggest that the benefits of engaging in active activities far exceed the advantages of staying inactive. Active activities involve engaging in physical or mental activities that encourage interaction with others and direct involvement with the environment. Participating in activities such as sports, volunteer work, or creative endeavors has been found to lead to increased productivity, better physical health, and improved cognitive functioning. Conversely, the drawbacks of inactive activities can leave individuals feeling unfulfilled and out of touch with reality. 

In contrast, inactive activities such as reading, listening to music, watching television, and playing video games can serve a purpose in people's lives. These activities can provide valuable rest and relaxation, allowing people to recharge after a difficult day or and to gain a new perspective. In addition, accomplishments can be found within these activities. A person can strive to finish a book series or learn how to play a musical instrument. Furthermore, this type of activity can help to develop mental skills such as problem-solving, as well as aiding the development of physical skills like hand-eye coordination. 

Taking risks and facing fears can be a necessary part of learning and progressing. Discomfort and anxiety can help spur on growth and innovation, and can even be helpful in strengthening relationships. However, the consequences of taking risks can be anything from exhilaration to disappointment, so it's important to weigh the risks and rewards before deciding whether or not to take a risk.

Overall, understanding the consequences of taking risks versus staying inactive can help us better prepare for success. Knowing when to take a risk and when to stay safe has a great impact on our daily lives and can help us achieve both short-term and long-term goals. Knowing when and how to properly take risks and push through fears can open new doors and lead us to a better future.",1
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. This strategy has been implemented in various places around the world, and the results have been promising. By reducing the reliance on cars, people can experience benefits such as reduced pollution, improved health and safety, and enhanced community cohesion and accessibility.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a substantial portion of these emissions, which contribute to climate change. For instance, in Europe, passenger cars alone contribute to 12% of greenhouse gas emissions (Rosenthal, 2009). By limiting car usage, especially in suburban areas, where car dependency is high, a significant decrease in emissions can be achieved.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can greatly improve air quality by reducing pollution. In cities like Paris, where smog levels reach alarming levels, driving bans have been implemented to clear the air (Duffer, 2014). These measures have resulted in a significant decrease in congestion and pollution, providing citizens with cleaner and healthier environments to live in. Similarly, car-free days implemented in Bogota have shown how reducing car usage can improve air quality and reduce traffic congestion (Selsky, 2002).

In addition to environmental benefits, limiting car usage can also have positive impacts on public health and safety. By encouraging people to use alternative modes of transportation such as walking, biking, or public transit, individuals can increase physical activity levels, leading to better overall health. Moreover, with fewer cars on the roads, the risk of accidents and injuries decreases, making communities safer for pedestrians and cyclists.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the enhancement of community cohesion and accessibility. Suburban areas that are designed with a car-first mentality often lack the amenities and services that are easily accessible by foot or public transportation. By implementing smart planning strategies that prioritize compact and walkable communities, like Vauban in Germany, residents have access to shops and services that are within walking distance (Rosenthal, 2009). This fosters a sense of community and reduces the need for long-distance commutes, which can be time-consuming and costly.

In conclusion, there are numerous advantages to limiting car usage. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality to promoting public health and safety and enhancing community cohesion, limiting car usage can have a positive impact on individuals, communities, and the environment. Cities, suburbs, and countries around the world have already started implementing strategies to limit car usage, and these efforts should be encouraged and expanded to create more sustainable and livable communities.",1
"A recent study has revealed that the use of public transportation is on the rise. This trend can be attributed to many different factors such as rising fuel costs, environmental concerns and a desire for convenience. Despite these benefits, there are still some drawbacks associated with using public transportation. First and foremost, safety is always a concern when it comes to public transportation. Public transport systems tend to attract more criminal activity than other forms of travel due to their large numbers of users in confined spaces which makes them an easy target for criminals. In addition, delays are common problems with public transport services especially during peak hours or inclement weather conditions which can lead to commuters arriving late at their destinations. Furthermore, most forms of public transportation require travellers to pay fares in order to use them while personal vehicles do not have this requirement making it more expensive overall compared to traveling by car or bike. Despite these drawbacks, there are still many advantages associated with taking advantage of the available options for travelling via public transit systems including increased efficiency in covering long distances; reduced traffic congestion on roads resulting from fewer cars being used; availability of special pass programs offering discounts as well as accessibility since buses and trains often go places where cars cannot access easily like narrow alleyways or steep hillsides etcetera . For those living within cities particularly ones without access private vehicles , relying upon buses and trains may be the only way they can get around efficiently thereby improving their quality of life significantly . Additionally , researchers have also found that using public transport instead of driving reduces air pollution remarkably thereby protecting our environment from further damage . . Considering all these aspects it's clear why taking advantage off all available modes off mass transit remains important even today . Not only does it offer convenience but also helps protect both people’s health and our planet’s environment alike .

"There is no doubt that advertisements often make products seem much better than they really are. However, I believe that this is not always the case. Sometimes, advertisements accurately reflect the quality of a product.

For example, consider a pair of shoes that are being advertised. If the shoes are of poor quality, the advertisement will likely reflect that. The advertisement might show a person wearing the shoes and then falling down. Alternatively, the advertisement might show the shoes falling apart after being worn for a short time.

In contrast, if the shoes are of good quality, the advertisement might show a person wearing the shoes and then dancing or running. The advertisement might also show the shoes being worn for a long time without any problems.

This example illustrates that not all advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Sometimes, the advertisements accurately reflect the quality of the product.

"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

With the growing concern about the drastic impacts of climate change due to greenhouse gas emissions, particularly those from cars, a new trend of limiting car usage is on the rise globally. This transformative approach to mobility not only holds a direct and substantial promise in preserving the environment, but also offers multiple other advantages such as improving urban planning and quality of life, thus making it advantageous in the long run.

A convincing proof of the benefits of limiting car usage can be found in the suburb of Vauban in Germany. Seventy percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, leading to quieter, more pedestrian-friendly streets where the ""swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor""(Rosenthal, Passage 3). The entire community, designed to discourage car ownership, promotes a lifestyle that is less tense and more enjoyable, indicating an improvement in overall quality of life(Rosenthal, Passage 3).

Car-limited and car-free communities are proving to be promising in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars contribute to 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in car-intensive areas in the United States (Rosenthal, Passage 5). Therefore, adopting car-free lifestyles, as seen in Vauban and during the Day Without Cars event in Bogota, Colombia (Selsky, Passages 20-28), can drastically curtail these emissions, promoting a healthier, cleaner environment.

Modes of transport considered environmentally friendly are being heavily promoted in cities. For instance, New York has introduced a bike-sharing program (Rosenthal, Passage 37), while public transportation becomes free during car-free events, as seen in Paris and Bogota (Duffer, Passage 18; Selsky, Passage 21). These alternatives not only reduce emissions but also help in promoting a shared economy and lower personal maintenance costs.

The limitation of car usage can also mitigate the increasingly hazardous levels of smog in busier cities. The decision to enforce a partial driving ban in smog-engulfed Paris resulted in a 60% reduction in congestion (Duffer, Passage 14), thus ameliorating the city's air quality and enhancing the citizens' health.

Moreover, less reliance on cars cultivates improved urban planning. The Vauban suburb demonstrates that less space for parking enables the creation of compact, more accessible communities (Rosenthal, Passage 6). This makes public transportation more reachable and encourages the establishment of stores within walking distance rather than in far-off malls (Rosenthal, Passage 6).

However, transitioning into a culture of reduced car usage requires adjustments from sectors like the auto industry. Brands like Ford and Mercedes are already shifting their focus from just cars to a broader product range as part of mobility solutions (Rosenthal, Passage 34). This trend stimulates innovation and diversification in the industry.

In conclusion, the shift towards reducing car usage is more than an environmental mission. It comprises multiple co-benefits that contribute to a sustainable and livable urban future while promoting improved health conditions, a higher quality of life, innovation, and improved urban infrastructure. In this era of alarming environmental conditions, limiting car usage appears to be an excellent means of combatting climate change.",1
"It's no surprise that technology has changed the way we live our lives. From smart phones to streaming services, digital devices have become an integral part of everyday life in the 21st century. But what about augmented and virtual reality? This relatively new form of technology has been gaining traction as a means of entertainment and work productivity, allowing users to enter a completely different world with just a few clicks or swipes on their smartphone. Augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR for short) is defined as “the use of computer-generated simulations to create interactive visualizations in which objects from the real world are enhanced by adding sounds, images, animations, etc.,” according to Merriam Webster Dictionary. In other words, it combines elements from both physical reality and information generated by computers into one cohesive experience that can be accessed through mobile devices or special headsets. AR/VR technology allows users to view 3D images overlaid onto their environment or explore entirely new worlds created in software development tools such as Unity3D or UnrealEngine. . The applications for AR/VR are vast: they range from medical training scenarios where doctors practice delicate surgeries without risk of harming actual patients; gaming experiences where players can fully immerse themselves into simulated environments; educational opportunities allowing students to explore historical events; business collaboration tools that allow workers around the globe to connect virtually; and much more!. The healthcare industry is already making great strides towards incorporating this type of technology into patient care - there has even been research conducted on using AR/VR therapy sessions with autism spectrum disorder patients who benefit greatly from being able to control certain aspects of their surroundings while still receiving professional guidance during treatment programs. Meanwhile NASA is exploring how these technologies could be used for interplanetary travel simulation exercises!. The potential benefits associated with augmented and virtual reality are tremendous – opening up whole new realms for exploration never before possible within traditional media forms like film or video games.

"No matter how big or small it is, every city has something special to offer its residents and visitors. For me, the most captivating aspect of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania is its rich history. The City of Brotherly Love has a long and storied past that dates back over three hundred years and includes significant contributions to our nation’s development in many different areas. Philadelphia was founded in 1682 by William Penn as part of the Pennsylvania colony, which grew out of a land grant from King Charles II.Penn envisioned Philadelphia as an ideal city based on his Quaker principles which included religious tolerance – something that would be very rare during this time period all over the world – but especially in America, where freedom for people of all faiths were nonexistent almost everywhere else. From then until now, Philadelphia had played a major role in American history; some notable moments include being home to both the signing of the Declaration of Independence and Constitution at Independence Hall , serving as temporary capital for a brief period between 1790-1800 when Congress met there , housing one of first public libraries (established 1731), plus hosting two World Fairs - 1876 Centennial Exposition & 1926 Sesquicentennial International Exposition . . Not only did these events make Philly famous throughout history books across America but they also sparked immense growth within the city itself: new industries arose such as cotton mills/textiles (which helped usher in industrial revolution) while also creating hundreds upon hundreds jobs for immigrants who flooded into PHL shortly before + during 1900s – making this population boom possible due to abundant job opportunities available here during those times . . Today we can still see remnants from those eras around us like Betsy Ross house , Franklin Square Park & Liberty Bell Pavilion - making it clear why so many tourists flock here year after year just get glimpse what once was!

"The globalization of the internet has made it easier than ever before to access information and resources from around the world. This evolution in technology has opened up many opportunities for individuals, businesses, and organizations alike. However, with this newfound freedom comes some difficulty as well; namely that of online privacy and data security concerns. It is no secret that hackers are constantly searching for ways to steal personal or sensitive data from unsuspecting victims – whether it be financial information or intellectual property. As a result of this threat, many people have become increasingly concerned about their own safety when it comes to browsing the web or engaging in any type of online activity that involves providing personal information. One particular area where these concerns become particularly relevant is social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn etcetera. Despite all the benefits these websites provide in terms of communication and networking capabilities they also require users’ consent on sharing certain types of private information (e-mail address, telephone numbers etc.) with other users who might want to contact them directly through messaging services provided by said platforms. In addition to this there is always a risk posed by malicious third parties trying to take advantage of user’s trust placing software programs on their computers without their knowledge which can then be used remotely with harmful intent (including stealing passwords). To protect oneself against potential threats like those mentioned above one should start by being aware just how much detail they are exposing both themselves and others within their profile pages on social networks but more importantly being conscious about what links they click when surfing the net since some malicious programs can install automatically once clicked upon which could potentially cause harm if not detected early enough during system scans . Furthermore one should also choose wisely when selecting applications offered via networked sites as sometimes developers hide malware programs inside seemingly harmless ones which could cause irreparable damage if installed . Last but certainly not least setting strong passwords each time an account needs protection should never be overlooked due its role as a first line defense against unwanted interference into our

"As the world develops and modernizes, opinions regarding whether to inform a family member who has cancer of their diagnosis vary. While some people believe that the patient should be told the truth, others think traditional Chinese practices should still be observed. I personally believe that the decision to tell a family member with cancer their diagnosis lies with the individual, and should be based on the individual’s particular circumstances. 

On the one hand, many people believe that it is important to give the person with cancer the opportunity to come to terms with their diagnosis and make the best decisions for their future. Telling the person their diagnosis allows them to prepare for the possible physical and emotional effects of their treatment. It also gives them the opportunity to make decisions about their life, such as seeking support from friends and family or seeking counseling for their mental health. Furthermore, it gives the family time to come to terms with their diagnosis as well, and to provide emotional and physical support to the person with cancer. 

On the other hand, some people believe that traditional Chinese practices should still be observed. They argue that it is not appropriate to burden the person with cancer with their diagnosis, as this can cause unnecessary anxiety and stress. They believe it is better to wait until the person is more psychologically and emotionally prepared for the diagnosis. This can be especially true if the person is elderly, as they may not be able to handle the shock of the diagnosis. As well, it may be more difficult for them to cope with the treatment and the outlook of their prognosis.

In conclusion, it is ultimately up to the individual to decide if they should tell their family member with cancer their diagnosis. If they choose to do so, they should make sure they are in a supportive environment and are emotionally ready to process the news. However, if they decide not to, then traditional Chinese practices should be observed. Whichever one chooses, it is important to consider the individual’s particular circumstances, and ensure that the family member with cancer is given the best possible care.

With the introduction of a school day that is one and a half hours longer, students and their families stand to benefit from the increased educational opportunities. For students, a longer day could result in better academic performance as they are provided with additional access to help and guidance from teachers. Furthermore, this longer school day could provide students with more resources to aid in their learning, such as extra curricular activities that promote individual growth, or study groups and labs to help improve their understanding of challenging topics. With the additional resources, students could take more initiative in their own education, which could lead to increased satisfaction in learning. 

On the other hand, longer school days could lead to teachers and students feeling overwhelmed with the extra time spent in the classroom. The increased workload associated with the extra one and a half hours might lead to a decline in student motivation and engagement in the lessons. Additionally, many students might struggle to keep up with the same rigorous schedule everyday, hampering their ability to learn effectively.

Despite the potential disadvantages of having a one and a half hour school day, there are many potential benefits that could result from this extension in the day. These benefits not only include improved academic performance for students, but also the convenience for their families. Having a longer school day could provide parents with more free time in their day, as their children are given ample time to complete their work and learn new skills. This could be invaluable for families with multiple responsibilities and could result in a greater sense of satisfaction for everyone involved. How the pros and cons balance out depend on the specific school environment; still, a one and a half hour school day could reap great benefits for those who are willing to give it a try.",1
"Living in a rural area has its advantages and disadvantages, but it is ultimately an enjoyable experience if you embrace the lifestyle. Growing up in a small town can be both exciting and challenging since there are more limited opportunities compared to large cities. However, living in a rural area also provides unique experiences that can't be found anywhere else. One of the most significant benefits of living in a rural area is the strong sense of community among neighbors. In larger communities, people may not know each other very well or at all; however, those who live near one another in smaller towns actively work together to solve problems and support each other during difficult times. Additionally, country folks tend to look out for one another through acts such as sharing tools and offering help during times of need which helps develop relationships between neighbors that last for years or even decades!. The close proximity to nature also makes living in a rural area enjoyable because there is always something new to explore without having to take long trips away from home. Nature lovers will find themselves surrounded by lush forests with beautiful wildlife like deer, wild turkeys and songbirds while others might appreciate taking time away from their computer screens and phones by walking around nearby lakes with gorgeous sunsets reflecting off them late into the evening hours. Furthermore, growing your own fruits or vegetables on your land allows individuals an opportunity to connect with food sources directly- giving you satisfaction knowing exactly what goes into what’s being consumed!. Finally, living in a small town gives residents access to local businesses that cannot easily exist elsewhere due family run establishments often passed down through generations still standing today despite economic trends over time- proving loyalty amongst locals who have kept these stores alive regardless! Cute boutiques selling locally handmade crafts including knit sweaters are common as well as rustic restaurants serving seasonal meals made fresh daily using ingredients grown right here within this area!. . Overall, life outside metropolitan hubs offers citizens something special: less noise pollution coupled with more opportunities

"Leadership has been an important aspect of human civilization since time immemorial. Leaders have been responsible for inspiring and directing people towards a common goal. However, not all leaders have been successful in their roles. While some leaders have been able to achieve great things, others have failed to make a significant impact. Therefore, it is essential to identify the qualities that make an effective leader. In this essay, I will argue that the most important quality of an effective leader is the ability to remain consistently committed to particular principles and objectives.

Firstly, an effective leader should have a clear vision of what they want to achieve. This vision should be based on certain principles that the leader believes in. For instance, if a leader believes in equality, their vision should be to create a society where everyone is treated equally. This vision should guide the leader's decision-making process and inspire their followers to work towards achieving it. If the leader is not committed to this vision and principles, they are likely to change their minds when faced with challenges or opposition. This will make it difficult for their followers to trust them.

Secondly, an effective leader should have a long-term perspective. They should be able to see beyond the immediate challenges and focus on the bigger picture. This means that they should not be easily influenced by shifts in popular opinion. For example, if a leader believes that climate change is a significant threat to humanity, they should not change their stance just because some people do not believe in it. They should remain committed to this principle and work towards finding sustainable solutions to mitigate the effects of climate change. This will require them to make tough decisions that may not be popular in the short term, but will benefit society in the long term.

Thirdly, an effective leader should be consistent in their actions. They should walk the talk and lead by example. If a leader is committed to a particular principle, they should ensure that their actions align with it. For example, if a leader believes in transparency, they should ensure that their administration is transparent and accountable to the public. This will inspire trust and confidence in their leadership, and their followers will be more likely to emulate their behavior.

In conclusion, the most essential quality of an effective leader is the ability to remain consistently committed to particular principles and objectives. Leaders who are easily influenced by shifts in popular opinion are unlikely to achieve their goals. Therefore, it is important for leaders to have a clear vision, a long-term perspective, and consistency in their actions. These qualities will inspire trust and confidence in their leadership and enable them to achieve great things.

One example of an inspiring individual who has used failure as a way to become successful is the entrepreneur Steve Jobs. Jobs was famously fired from Apple, the company he founded, in 1985. In 1996 he returned to Apple with a renewed sense of ambition and drive, and made the decisions which turned the company around and made it the international success it is today. Jobs himself stated that being fired from his own company forced him to push himself and think differently than before, stating ""Getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me... The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.” Jobs' experience with failure ultimately inspired him to become even more successful, thus demonstrating the beneficial effects that failure can have in inspiring people to become successful.",1
"Traveling is one of the best ways to explore the world and experience different cultures. There are many ways to travel, but the best way is in a group led by a tour guide. This is because a tour guide can provide safety and security, local knowledge, and guidance.

Safety and security are important when traveling, especially in unfamiliar places. A tour guide can provide a sense of security by ensuring that the group stays together and follows the itinerary. Tour guides are also knowledgeable about the local area, so they can provide information about potential risks and how to avoid them. For example, a tour guide may advise against walking alone at night or taking certain routes.

Local knowledge is another benefit of traveling with a tour guide. Tour guides are familiar with the local culture and customs, so they can provide information about the best places to visit and the best things to do. They can also provide tips on how to blend in with the locals and avoid offending anyone. Tour guides are also knowledgeable about local attractions, so they can help the group find the best places to visit and the best activities to do.

Finally, a tour guide can provide guidance and support throughout the trip. Tour guides can help the group stay on track and make sure they don’t miss any important sights or activities. They can also help the group navigate unfamiliar places and provide advice on how to get around. Tour guides can also help the group find restaurants, shops, and other services.

In conclusion, the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. Tour guides can provide safety and security, local knowledge, and guidance. They can help the group stay safe, find the best places to visit, and get around unfamiliar places. With a tour guide, travelers can make the most of their trip and have an unforgettable experience.

"The debate over how the government should allocate it's resources is a long-standing one. On one side, some people argue that the government should prioritize medical care and education, while others argue that building theaters and sports stadiums is also important. In my opinion, the government should invest in both medical care and education, as well as theaters and sports stadiums.

To begin with, it is essential that the government invest in medical care and education. Medical care is essential for the health and well-being of citizens, and education is essential for the development of a nation. Investing in medical care and education will ensure that citizens have access to quality healthcare and educational opportunities, which will in turn lead to a healthier and more educated population. In addition, investing in medical care and education will help to reduce poverty and inequality, as access to quality healthcare and education is often a key factor in determining a person's economic status.

At the same time, it is also important for the government to invest in theaters and sports stadiums. These investments can help to create jobs and stimulate the economy. For example, building a theater or sports stadium will create jobs for construction workers, architects, and other professionals. In addition, these investments can help to attract tourists and generate revenue for the local economy. Furthermore, theaters and sports stadiums can provide a source of entertainment and recreation for citizens, which can help to promote a sense of community and togetherness.

In conclusion, I believe that the government should invest in both medical care and education, as well as theaters and sports stadiums. Investing in medical care and education is essential for the health and well-being of citizens, while investing in theaters and sports stadiums can help to create jobs and stimulate the economy. Both of these investments are important for the development of a nation, and the government should strive to allocate it's resources in a way that benefits all citizens.

"The Art of Gardening: A Reflection on the Beauty and Satisfaction of Growing Your Own Food. Gardening is an art. It takes a special skill to understand how to cultivate plants, vegetables, fruits, and herbs in a way that produces the best yields for harvest. And yet so many people have become enamored with this activity - from hobbyists to professional gardeners who take their craft seriously. By taking the time to invest in one's own gardening skillset, countless rewards await; it can provide us with an abundance of delicious food while also being an incredibly calming pastime. One could argue that there is something deeply satisfying about growing your own food supply. Taking seedlings or seed packets out into nature or even onto a balcony and watching them grow over time gives one a sense of accomplishment - after all, you are essentially creating something with your own two hands! In addition, there’s such beauty in seeing firsthand how these edible creations come alive under your care – whether they be succulent tomatoes starting out as small green buds or yellow squash blossoming open towards the sun overhead. When you tend to these plants yourself (or perhaps alongside some helpful bees!), you get to appreciate each step along the growth process - from planting seeds below ground level up through harvesting them at peak ripeness when ready for consumption. This same appreciation can be found throughout any type of gardening regardless if it’s flowers, trees/shrubs or vegetables — making every single pursuit within this realm worthwhile no matter which route taken by its enthusiast(s). . Beyond providing sustenance -- either organically raised produce versus store-bought -- gardening offers other benefits too: reduced stress levels due its meditative qualities stemming from being amongst nature as well as improved mental clarity since tasks like weeding involve intense focus . Additionally , depending on where one lives , joining local community gardens allows individuals access not only fresh ingredients but relationships built amongst fellow gardeners; oft

Additionally, some people believe that the paper card is more environmentally friendly because it does not require any extra resources to produce.

On the other hand, some people believe that electronic cards are more convenient. For example, electronic cards can be sent electronically, which can be more convenient for some people. Additionally, some people believe that electronic cards are more secure, which can be a nice touch for some people.

"When faced with the challenge of writing an essay on a seemingly random topic, it is best to make the subject matter as specific as possible. A great example of this would be to write an essay about the importance of self-love and authenticity in today's society. Self-love can have many meanings; however, when considering its implications in our current world, it refers primarily to one’s ability to accept themselves for who they are regardless of their shortcomings. It also means being honest with oneself and owning up to mistakes rather than covering them up or ignoring them completely; this concept is often referred to as “authenticity"". With regards to how self-love and authenticity affect individuals every day, there are numerous beneficial effects that come from both concepts implemented into everyday life. First off, having a strong sense of self-worth helps us stay positive even during difficult times, which is especially important when presented with adversity or other stressful situations. Furthermore, practicing authentic communication allows us access greater levels of understanding between ourselves and those around us by ensuring that what we say aligns with what we actually mean - a crucial element necessary for successful relationships both platonic and romantic alike!. The significance these two aspects carry within our culture becomes more evident still upon examining how they apply specifically within various minority groups such as LGBTQ+ folks or people belonging to underprivileged backgrounds (financially). In particular, marginalized communities have historically felt pressured by outside expectations based on gender roles or financial status etc., so any encouragement towards embracing one’s true selves instead presents itself as a freeing experience rather than confining one down certain paths through societal norms alone. Additionally, feeling accepted amongst other members sharing similar experiences can reduce feelings of isolation while strengthening bonds between peers at a much faster rate since nobody has anything left hidden away from each other like before (i.e.: not being forced into maintaining facades) - creating an environment conducive for open dialogue without fear nor judgement present!

I agree wholeheartedly with Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" The ability to step out of one's comfort zone and take on a new challenge is essential to becoming a better, more rounded version of oneself. I personally have experienced this firsthand.

For example, while in college, I decided to branch out and try a language class I had never studied before: Japanese. I had never taken any Japanese courses before, nor did I have any prior knowledge of the language. It was a huge undertaking to learn an entirely new language, and I experienced numerous setbacks along the way. However, through hard work and dedication, I was eventually able to get a handle on it. But perhaps more importantly, through conquering this challenge I gained a much greater appreciation for myself and my abilities—and had come a long way in terms of personal growth.

Similarly, in my professional career I chose to take on a project that I had never attempted before. I had to learn a new programming language and adapt to other unfamiliar tools. Again, I encountered many roadblocks during this process, but the experience allowed me to gain a much greater understanding of programming and develop my coding skills to a point where I can now take on even more complex tasks.

Trying something new is never easy, and there is certainly no guarantee of success. But by taking the plunge and pushing my own boundaries, I have been able to experience great growth and come to a better understanding of my capabilities. Therefore, I fully agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson’s statement, and believe that pushing oneself to try something beyond what one has already mastered is the only way to truly grow.",1
"I believe that the university education should not only prepare students for employment, but also provide them with the tools necessary to pursue a successful career. Many universities offer excellent programs in business, accounting, marketing, and other fields, which can help students secure well-paying jobs after graduation. Additionally, universities offer many opportunities for students to gain experience in various fields before embarking on their career path.

Some people may argue that university education is only meant to provide students with a solid foundation in the sciences and humanities, and that it is not necessary to have a job after graduation in order to be successful. However, I believe that having a job is a valuable asset, as it allows students to learn directly from professionals in the field, develop essential skills, and build a resume that will show potential employers that they are ready for a career in that field.

Additionally, many careers require a degree, even if that degree is not in a specific field. For example, many medical professionals, lawyers, and engineers currently require a university degree to be hired. A college education provides students with the cognitive and analytical skills necessary for success in many fields, and can give them the foundation for a successful career.

In conclusion, I believe that the university education should provide students with a balanced education that offers them the opportunity to explore many different fields of study. A university education can help students secure well-paying jobs after graduation, gain experience in various fields, and develop essential skills that will enable them to pursue a successful career.

"In today's fast-paced world, young people are often preoccupied with their own lives and goals, leaving little time for community service. While some may argue that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities, I believe that this is not entirely true. In this essay, I will explain why I disagree with this statement and provide examples to support my argument.

Firstly, young people are often involved in various extracurricular activities that benefit their communities. For instance, many high school students participate in volunteer programs that help the less fortunate, such as food banks, homeless shelters, and community centers. These programs not only provide valuable services to those in need but also teach young people important life skills such as teamwork, leadership, and empathy. Moreover, many universities and colleges require students to complete a certain number of community service hours before graduation, which encourages young people to get involved in their communities.

Secondly, young people are increasingly using social media and other online platforms to raise awareness and support for various causes. For example, the #MeToo movement, which started as a hashtag on social media, has brought attention to the issue of sexual harassment and assault, and has led to changes in laws and policies. Similarly, young people are using online platforms to raise awareness about climate change, racial injustice, and other social issues. While this may not involve physical volunteering, it is still a valuable contribution to the community.

Finally, it is important to recognize that young people face many challenges and pressures that may limit their ability to volunteer. For example, many young people are juggling school, work, and family responsibilities, leaving little time for community service. Additionally, some young people may face financial or transportation barriers that make it difficult to volunteer. Therefore, it is unfair to assume that young people do not care about their communities simply because they are not volunteering as much as we would like them to.

In conclusion, while it may be true that some young people do not give enough time to helping their communities, it is unfair to generalize this statement. Many young people are actively involved in volunteer programs, using social media to raise awareness, and facing their own challenges and pressures. Therefore, it is important to encourage and support young people in their efforts to contribute to their communities, rather than criticizing them for not doing enough.

"Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. There are several important reasons for this. 

First and foremost, using a cell phone while driving distracts the driver from paying full attention to the road. Whether it's talking, texting, or otherwise interacting with the phone, the driver's eyes and mind are drawn away from what is happening in front of them. This puts not only the driver but also other people on the road in danger. Even hands-free phone calls require cognitive attention that should be focused on driving. Numerous studies have shown that distracted driving from cell phones delays reaction times as much as having a blood alcohol content over the legal driving limit. 

Second, texting while driving in particular is an extremely risky behavior. Sending or reading a text requires the driver to take their eyes entirely off the road for prolonged periods. This leaves them unaware of what is happening around them as traffic flows at fast speeds. Texting while driving has been found to increase the risk of a crash by over 20 times compared to non-distracted driving. It is simply too dangerous a behavior to allow while someone is controlling a multi-ton vehicle.

Finally, allowing any cell phone use sets a poor precedent and can encourage more unsafe behaviors over time. A driver may start with just brief conversations but become acclimated to more extended and complex phone interactions behind the wheel. It also sends a message that cell phones do not significantly impact safety, which is untrue. A total cell phone ban creates a clearer standard that phones have no place in vehicle operation and keeps drivers' full attention where it needs to be.

In conclusion, cell phones represent too serious a distraction to driving performance and safety. For the protection of all road users, drivers should not be permitted to use their phones in any way when operating a motor vehicle. Public health and safety must take priority over any perceived convenience of phone use behind the wheel. A complete ban on cell phones is the safest and most prudent policy.",1
"The increased prevalence of digital media in our daily lives has revolutionized the way we interact with one another, allowing us to share and consume content that was previously only available through traditional means. Despite the obvious benefits that digital media provides, there have been some negative effects on society as well. One example is the impact it has had on physical activity levels in children over recent decades. As technology continues to become more advanced, screens are becoming more accessible than ever before. A child can watch TV shows and movies streamed directly from their phone or laptop, play video games with friends online rather than face-to-face and even be entertained by scrolling endlessly through social media feeds for hours on end. This increase in sedentary behavior poses a serious health risk to young people who are not getting enough exercise when they should be engaging in physical activities such as playing sports or running around outside with their peers instead of being glued to a screen at all times. Not only does excessive screen time lead to physical problems like obesity later down the line but it also affects mental wellbeing by limiting opportunities for creative thinking and interpersonal connection with real world activities reducing overall happiness levels. With fewer chances for meaningful conversations and interactions due to spending more time looking at screens rather than interacting face-to-face this can lead to feelings of isolation which might manifest into depression if left unchecked. Moreover, scrolling through algorithms designed specifically around what keeps viewers ‘engaged’ - meaning watching ads between videos - creates an unhealthy relationship between users wanting gratification no matter how meaningless each click may appear while decreasing attention spans over extended periods of time making them less likely focus properly on other tasks like studying in school or work related duties which require higher level cognitive functions like problem solving skills etc. Digital media plays an important role in modern society but too much reliance upon these tools without proper guidance could be potentially damaging both physically and mentally especially among younger generations who should prioritize active lifestyles over increased consumption rates originating from devices such

"The Chinese culture traditionally values discretion and privacy. It is believed that telling the patient the truth about their condition will cause them unnecessary worry and distress. This is especially true in cases of cancer, where the patient may be emotionally and physically unprepared for the news.

In recent years, however, there has been a movement to change this practice. Some argue that it is important to be honest with patients about their condition, as this can help them to take control of their treatment and cope with the challenges ahead. Others believe that the tradition of discretion should be maintained, in order to protect the privacy of the patient and their family.

Arguments for and against changing the tradition of discretion in cases of cancer are both valid. It is important to weigh up the benefits and drawbacks of each before making a decision. Ultimately, it is up to the individual family members to decide what is best for their loved ones.

"A discussion about the use of solar energy as a renewable energy source is an important conversation to have today. For many years, we have relied on fossil fuels for our electricity production, but these sources are not sustainable and come with environmental costs. Solar energy can be used to reduce reliance on traditional electricity generation and create clean, renewable energy that will help us achieve sustainability goals without compromising the environment or other resources. Solar power utilizes sunlight to generate electricity, meaning that it is a virtually limitless source of renewable energy. Photovoltaic (PV) technology uses semiconductor materials like silicon to convert sun rays into electric current which can then be used in households or businesses. Solar cells absorb light particles known as photons from the sun’s rays and convert them into electrical charges so they can be stored in batteries or sent directly through wires into household appliances or buildings. As long as there is direct sunlight available during daylight hours, solar panels will continue producing electric currents which makes this form of renewable energy attractive due to its high availability throughout most parts of the world year-round. The benefits associated with using solar power extend beyond just being able to produce electricity sustainably; installing PV systems also requires minimal maintenance compared to traditional forms of generating power such as coal plants or natural gas turbines since solar arrays do not need fuel replenished regularly like these other sources require. Additionally, since PV installations are modularized by nature it allows homeowners flexibility when deciding how much capacity they would like their system to contain – allowing them customize their needs while staying within budget constraints if necessary! Finally, using solar technology creates jobs along every step in its manufacturing process from raw material sourcing all way up until installation at homes/businesses making it an economic boon for communities looking for new employment opportunities related green initiatives!. In conclusion, utilizing smartly designed photovoltaic installations wherever possible should become more priority moving forward given its cost effectiveness over time coupled with its ability provide consumers reliable & sustainable access clean

"The debate of whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate has been ongoing for many years. While both sides of the argument have valid points, I believe that children should be taught to cooperate.

Cooperation is an important life skill that can help children in many aspects of their lives. It teaches them how to work together, share resources, and resolve conflicts. It also helps them to develop empathy and respect for others. When children learn to cooperate, they learn how to communicate effectively and work together to achieve a common goal. This can help them to build strong relationships with their peers, which can be beneficial in the future.

Competition, on the other hand, can lead to negative outcomes. It can create an environment of comparison and judgement, which can be damaging to a child’s self-esteem. It can also lead to feelings of resentment and animosity between peers. Furthermore, it can encourage children to focus on winning at all costs, which can lead to unethical behavior.

In my opinion, cooperation should be the focus when teaching children. It encourages them to work together, share resources, and develop empathy for others. It also helps them to build strong relationships with their peers, which can be beneficial in the future. Furthermore, it teaches them how to resolve conflicts peacefully and effectively.

In conclusion, I believe that children should be taught to cooperate rather than compete. Cooperation is an important life skill that can help children in many aspects of their lives. It encourages them to work together, share resources, and develop empathy for others. It also helps them to build strong relationships with their peers, which can be beneficial in the future.

"The topic of this essay is the importance of employee recognition in the workplace. Employee recognition is a powerful tool that can be used by businesses to improve performance and morale, create a positive work environment, and promote overall productivity. In today's competitive job market, it's essential for organizations to take advantage of all available tools to motivate their employees and keep them engaged in their work. Employee recognition is one such tool - by recognizing an employee for their hard work or exemplary performance, organizations can create an atmosphere where employees feel valued and appreciated. This sense of appreciation will not only help increase motivation but also drive people to do better at their jobs as they strive for more recognition over time. Moreover, when employees are recognized for good behavior or outstanding achievements in the workplace, it encourages others around them to strive towards similar levels of excellence as well. The knowledge that you won't go unnoticed if your efforts are noticed will encourage team members to put in extra effort and become more productive overall. With greater productivity comes increased profits which benefit both the company itself as well as its individual workers through higher wages or bonuses associated with improved results on projects or tasks assigned to them by management. . Finally, boosting morale through regular employee recognition helps build camaraderie amongst team members which strengthens relationships between coworkers while promoting a healthier work-life balance featuring less stress and better mental health outcomes than those experienced without proper acknowledgement from supervisors or colleagues alike when goals have been achieved within set parameters or deadlines have been met. All these factors contribute greatly towards creating an ideal working climate conducive for achieving success both on an individual level as well as organization wide basis over time with minimal impact from external factors like changing customer demands or rising competition amongst rivals seeking out opportunities within targeted markets respectively due mainly down towards having motivated personnel onboard who remain loyal throughout difficult periods rather than jumping ship onto greener pastures elsewhere due mainly towards feeling unappreciated within current roles regardless how much tangible contributions might have already made during

"When peoples ask for advices, they sometimes talk to more than one person. This is a good thing to do because it can help them make a better choise.

One reason why seeking multiplie opinions can help is because different peoples have different perspectives. For example, if you ask your parents and your friends for advice, they might have different ideas about what you should do. Your parents might think that you should do something that is safe and stable, like going to college and getting a job. But your friends might think that you should do something that is more fun and exciting, like traveling or starting your own business. By hearing both sides, you can get a better understanding of the pros and cons of each option and make a more informed decision.

Another reason why seeking multiplie opinions can help is because it can help you avoid bias. Sometimes, peoples can get stuck in their own way of thinking and they might not see all the possibilities. If you only ask one person for advice, they might give you a biased opinion that is not really in your best interest. But if you ask multiple peoples, you can get a more well-rounded view of the situation and make a more fair choise.

For example, let's say you want to buy a new phone. You could ask your friend who works at the phone store for advice, but they might just try to sell you the most expensive phone. But if you also ask your brother who is a tech expert, he might tell you that there are cheaper options that are just as good. By hearing both opinions, you can make a more informed decision and save money.

In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions can help you make a better choise because it gives you different perspectives and helps you avoid bias. So, the next time you need advice, don't be afraid to ask more than one person!",1

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and urge you to consider its importance in preserving the integrity of our presidential elections. While there are arguments to be made for a direct popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College plays a crucial role in our democratic system and should be retained.

One of the primary reasons for keeping the Electoral College is its ability to provide certainty of outcome. As stated in the Office of the Federal Register's text, the winner-take-all system ensures that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. This helps prevent disputes and challenges to the election results, ensuring a smooth transition of power. In an era where the country is already heavily divided along political lines, avoiding prolonged legal battles over election results is of utmost importance to maintaining political stability.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it encourages presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. As noted by Judge Richard A. Posner, no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, requiring candidates to seek support from diverse parts of the country. By preventing candidates from solely focusing on highly populated areas, the Electoral College ensures that the interests and concerns of people from various regions are taken into account. This promotes a more balanced representation of the entire nation rather than catering only to the interests of densely populated areas.

Furthermore, the winner-take-all method employed by the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, where the outcome is uncertain. This ensures that voters in these states receive special attention from candidates, encouraging them to pay closer attention to the campaign. By giving swing state voters a greater say in the election, the Electoral College empowers the most thoughtful voters who are more likely to carefully consider the competing candidates' policies and proposals.

The Electoral College also helps to restore some of the weight in the political balance that large states may lose due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate, as Judge Richard A. Posner points out. The Electoral College allocates electoral votes based on the number of representatives in Congress, ensuring that larger states receive more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns. This balances the influence of smaller states, ensuring that their concerns are not overshadowed by those of larger ones.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. This avoids the complexity and cost associated with conducting additional elections. By providing a clear winner, the Electoral College allows for a smooth and efficient election process.

While there are valid arguments against the Electoral College, such as concerns of voter disenfranchisement and the possibility of the popular vote winner losing the presidency, these issues can be addressed through discussions on reforming the system rather than completely eliminating it. We should strive to explore potential modifications that can enhance its democratic nature, such as adopting a proportional allocation of electoral votes, as implemented in Maine and Nebraska.

In conclusion, the Electoral College has served as the backbone of our presidential election process for centuries, striking a balance between democratic representation and regional interests. Rather than discarding it outright, I believe it is vital to explore ways to improve the system to address its shortcomings, while retaining its fundamental principles. I urge you to consider these arguments in favor of the Electoral College and support its continuation.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to hearing about your position on this critical issue.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1

Inactivity can have a major impact on a person's life and those of their family in many ways. Physically, it can affect a person's health due to a lack of regular exercise and an inability to properly manage weight. Emotionally, it can lead to feelings of apathy and depression, due to reduced physical, social, and mental activity. And financially, inactivity can lead to decreased work productivity and economic growth. 

Despite the effects of inactivity, some people are able to overcome it. Through dedication and a drive to succeed, people have found their purpose and become self-motivated to overcome inactivity. Examples of people who have achieved personal and professional success despite inactivity include professional athletes who overcame injuries or health problems, entrepreneurs who managed to innovate despite the odds, and everyday individuals who became successful through self-help and a proactive mindset. 

Inactivity has a huge effect on employment and economic growth. Without people who are able to be productive, businesses suffer and overall growth declines. A person's ability to remain active is paramount for a nation to experience economic growth. Therefore, having a sense of purpose and a commitment to remain active is crucial to achieving success. 

To sum it up, inactivity can have a major effect on people's lives, both physically, emotionally, and financially. Despite this, people are capable of achieving personal and professional success through determination, dedication, and a proactive mindset. Moreover, it is important to understand the effect inactivity has on employment and economic growth. Taking all of this into account, it is clear that having a sense of purpose and the motivation to stay active is an essential part of finding success.",1

"Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my view that the United States should change from the Electoral College system to electing the president by popular vote. While the Electoral College was designed to give small states more influence, today's system can result in a president being elected despite losing the nationwide popular vote. This undermines the principle of one person, one vote and democratic fairness. 

Supporters of keeping the Electoral College argue that it encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and avoid focusing just on a few high population states. However, in recent elections we have seen candidates concentrate campaigning and advertising in only a handful of swing states that could vote either way. With a popular vote, every vote would matter equally and candidates would need to appeal to a broader range of citizens. It would encourage higher voter turnout nationwide rather than selective turnout in swing states.

It is also argued that the Electoral College system maintains the federal character of the election by giving small states more say. But in practice, the national popular vote winner almost always wins the Electoral College too. So the system does not significantly boost small states' influence. Furthermore, allocating electoral votes based on congressional districts in some states has politicized the redistricting process and led to instances of partisan gerrymandering to benefit one party. 

A nationwide popular vote would be a simpler, more straightforward and democratic process. It would ensure that the candidate preferred by the most Americans would become president. While changing to the popular vote may need an amendment, moving in this direction could help address concerns about how some recent elections have undermined faith in our democratic system. For these reasons, I believe moving to a national popular vote is a better approach and ensures that every valid vote has an equal say in choosing the president.",1
"Whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject is a topic of debate. While both approaches have their own advantages and disadvantages, I believe that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is beneficial. 

For one, having a wide base of knowledge can improve critical thinking. With a broad knowledge of a variety of topics, individuals can easily assess and weigh the merits of various ideas and arguments. This helps them make informed and logical decisions. For example, a student who has a broad knowledge of history, philosophy and economics could interpret the current economic situation more accurately than a student who specialized in just one subject. 

Moreover, broad knowledge allows individuals to draw connections between different fields. By having knowledge of multiple topics, they can develop new insights and understanding. For instance, if a student has studied both chemistry and economics, they can identify the economic implications of the various chemical processes. This can help them make informed decisions about how companies could operate more efficiently. 

However, there are some advantages to specialising in one subject. By devoting all their time and energy to one field, students can gain a deeper understanding of the topic. This can help them become experts in their chosen field and put them at an advantage when it comes to job opportunities. For instance, a student who specialises in mathematics can easily find employment in the finance sector. 

Finally, specialising in one subject can be beneficial for those who are seeking to pursue higher education. A student who has specialised in one field would have an edge over one who has broad knowledge in multiple fields, since they would be more familiar with the concepts and ideas related to their chosen subject. 

In conclusion, I believe that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is beneficial. It allows people to think critically, draw connections between different fields and develop a better understanding of the world. However, specialising in one subject can be advantageous in certain cases, such as when pursuing higher education or seeking employment in a certain field.

"Successful people are often considered to be those who are able to consistently excel in whatever they do. However, in order to sustain success, it is necessary to take on new challenges and risks. I believe that successful people should try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.

First, taking risks can lead to greater rewards. A successful person will be able to recognize when a risk is worth taking, so they can use their knowledge and skill set to maximize the potential benefits. For example, an entrepreneur may recognize a gap in the market and decide to take the risk of investing in a new venture. This risk can pay off if the venture is successful and the entrepreneur is able to reap the rewards of their efforts.

Second, taking risks can lead to personal growth. A successful person may recognize that in order to reach their goals, they must take on new challenges and push themselves out of their comfort zone. For example, a successful student may decide to take a course that is more difficult than the ones they are used to. This challenge will help them to develop new skills and knowledge, which can help to ensure that they continue to succeed in the future.

Finally, taking risks can lead to greater opportunities. A successful person may recognize that in order to advance in their field, they must take on new challenges and seek out new opportunities. For example, a successful professional may decide to apply for a promotion or a job in a different field. This risk can pay off if the professional is able to gain new skills and experience that can help them to reach the next level of success.

In conclusion, successful people should try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. Taking risks can lead to greater rewards, personal growth, and more opportunities. Therefore, successful people should be willing to take on new challenges and push themselves out of their comfort zone in order to achieve greater success.

"The importance of self-care in the digital age cannot be overstated. With technology so heavily embedded in our lives, it's all too easy to become attached to our devices and forget about taking care of ourselves. Self-care is more than just taking time out—it involves setting boundaries with digital usage, actively managing stress levels and ensuring that our mental health remains a priority. We live in an environment where not only are we constantly connected, but there is an expectation to respond quickly and be available 24/7. This can lead to feeling overwhelmed or burnt out from trying to do “everything” at once. Setting limits on how often you use social media, emails or text messages can be incredibly beneficial for your wellbeing as it gives you quality time away from your screens and provides space for relaxation or doing something else entirely – like going for a walk! You may even find that after having taken this break from the virtual world you may have more energy when using technology later on; thus allowing yourself some respite without sacrificing productivity. Self-care also requires being mindful of one’s stress levels and developing coping strategies if they start becoming unmanageable. Taking regular breaks throughout the day - whether this means having five minutes off during lunchtime or scheduling an hour twice a week devoted solely to reading a book - will help keep anxiety at bay whilst alleviating any potential screen fatigue associated with staring at bright screens all day long! Additionally, looking into activities such as meditation exercises could help reduce tension by offering moments of stillness which provide clarity amongst chaotic days filled with information overloads caused by work deadlines or notifications bombarding us every second!. Finally, prioritising mental health should never take second place despite how easily life gets in the way. Regularly check up on yourself both mentally and physically by getting enough sleep (around 8 hours per night) exercising regularly as well as engaging in hobbies which bring joy can make all the difference when feeling overwhelmed

"There are several advantages of limiting car usage. Firstly, it can help to reduce air pollution. Cars emit harmful gases into the environment which can have negative effects on our health. By limiting car usage, we can reduce the amount of pollution in our cities and improve the air quality for everyone.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is that it can help to reduce traffic congestion. In many cities around the world, there are too many cars on the road, which leads to traffic jams and long commuting times. By limiting car usage, we can encourage people to use public transportation or to cycle or walk instead, which can help to reduce traffic and make commuting faster and more efficient.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can also help to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. Cars are one of the biggest consumers of fossil fuels, and as these resources become scarcer, we need to find alternative ways to fuel our transportation needs. By reducing car usage, we can encourage the development of alternative transportation options, such as electric cars or public transportation powered by renewable energy.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers several advantages, including reducing air pollution, reducing traffic congestion, and reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. As citizens, we have a responsibility to take action to address these issues and create more sustainable communities. This can start with small changes, such as using public transportation or cycling instead of driving, and can ultimately lead to significant improvements in our environment and quality of life.",1

"The importance of preserving the coral reefs in Hawaii cannot be overstated. As one of the world's most diverse and beautiful ecosystems, coral reefs provide essential benefits to both people and wildlife that inhabit the Hawaiian Islands. Coral reefs are home to thousands of species of fish, sea turtles, urchins, mollusks, starfish and other aquatic life. A healthy coral reef also provides an important habitat for many birds such as boobies and frigatebirds who feed on fish found within its waters. Not only do these creatures benefit from having a place to live but they also help maintain balance within their respective ecosystems by providing food for larger predators like sharks or whales while simultaneously controlling populations levels through natural predation cycles. This delicate ecological balance is easily disrupted when any part of it is disturbed such as when human activities introduce pollutants into the water or cause physical damage to the environment due to destructive fishing practices or other forms of exploitation disaster can follow quickly after including decreased biodiversity and altered habitats So without protection measures in place this could have catastrophic consequences not just locally but globally as well since ocean currents will spread pollutants throughout all bodies of water eventually leading them back here again potentially causing irreversible harm if left unchecked.

"There is no single answer to this question as it depends on the individual's perspective. Some people might agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are, while others might disagree. I believe that, in general, most advertisements do make products seem better than they really are. This is because advertisements are designed to create a positive image of the product and to persuade people to buy it.

Advertisers use a number of techniques to make products seem better than they really are. For example, they often use superlatives such as ""the best"", ""the most"", and ""the newest"". They also use images and slogans that are attractive and appealing. In addition, they often make unrealistic claims about the product's benefits.

One reason why advertisements make products seem better than they really are is that they are trying to sell a product. Therefore, they need to create a positive image of the product in order to persuade people to buy it. Additionally, advertisers know that most people are not very good at evaluating products objectively. So, they use a number of techniques to make the product seem better than it really is.

There are a few reasons why people might buy a product even though they know it is not as good as the advertisement makes it'seem. Firstly, people might be persuaded by the advertisement's positive image and buy the product without thinking critically about it. Secondly, people might be attracted to the product's features or benefits, even though they know that the advertisement is exaggerating.

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage has numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. By reducing the reliance on cars, communities can improve air quality, decrease greenhouse gas emissions, and promote a healthier and more active lifestyle. This can be seen in examples from around the world, such as Vauban, Germany, Paris, France, and Bogota, Colombia.

One of the main benefits of limiting car usage is the positive impact on the environment. Greenhouse gas emissions from cars are a major contributor to global warming. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal in her article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. In the United States, car-intensive areas can contribute up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. By reducing car usage, communities can significantly reduce their carbon footprint and help combat climate change.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement in air quality. In her article ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" Robert Duffer explains how a partial driving ban in Paris resulted in a 60 percent decrease in congestion and significantly reduced smog levels. Similarly, Andrew Selsky discusses the popularity of car-free days in Bogota, Colombia, where millions of people hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work, leading to clear streets and reduced traffic jams. These examples demonstrate how limiting car usage can lead to cleaner air and a healthier environment for all.

Moreover, limiting car usage can promote a more active and healthier lifestyle. In Elisabeth Rosenthal's article ""The End of Car Culture,"" she highlights the decrease in car ownership, fewer miles driven, and a decline in the number of licenses being acquired in the United States. This shift in behavior suggests a cultural shift towards alternative modes of transportation. The presence of more bike paths, pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, and improved public transport options can encourage people to walk, bike, or use public transport more frequently, resulting in increased physical activity and improved overall health.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. By reducing reliance on cars, communities can improve air quality, decrease greenhouse gas emissions, and promote a healthier and more active lifestyle. Examples from around the world, such as Vauban, Paris, and Bogota, demonstrate the positive impact of limiting car usage. It is clear that embracing alternative modes of transportation is not only beneficial for the planet but also for our own well-being.",1

    It is clear that curfews for minors are a necessary part of society, especially in urban centers where crime is more common. Without curfews, minors are left vulnerable to dangerous situations that can arise in urban environments when not supervised by an adult. As a parent, I know the importance of teaching my children right from wrong and the value of having a safe place for them to go when out late in the city. One example of the dangers minors face if they are out late at night comes from a news story I heard recently about a teenage girl in the city being assaulted on her way home from school. The story made an impression on me, as it highlighted the need for a curfew to protect young people from similar situations.

It is important to teach minors why curfews are necessary, so they understand the importance of being safe. Having a set curfew provides a structure that dictates when it is time to come home, allowing parents to rest easy that their children will be in their care at an expected time. Curfews also provide an enforcement mechanism to help ensure minors are abiding by the rules and making wise decisions when out late at night. From a legal standpoint, they also protect minors from certain adult activities that may be considered inappropriate for their age. 

In conclusion, there is an undeniable need for cities to set curfews for minors in order to protect them from the potential dangers of late night urban travel. Curfews also provide an effective enforcement mechanism to ensure minors are making wise decisions and a safe environment for parents to know when their children will return home. Personal experience and news coverage have demonstrated the potential risks of allowing minors to roam late at night in an urban environment. This provides ample reason to support city councils adopting a curfew for minors.",1
"The importance of environmental sustainability cannot be overstated. Our planet is facing unprecedented ecological challenges due to pollution, global warming and habitat destruction caused by human activity. As a result, it is essential that individuals and communities prioritize protecting the environment in order to preserve our natural world for future generations. One way people can play an active role in promoting sustainable development is by making conscious decisions about their lifestyle choices. This could include choosing public transportation or bike riding over driving cars whenever possible; buying locally produced items; reducing waste from packaging materials through creative reuse projects; using energy efficient appliances and light bulbs; composting food scraps; investing in renewable energy sources like wind power or solar panels as much as feasible and planting native plants instead of non-native invasive species. All these practices support the principle of environmental stewardship which involves taking care of nature’s resources without depleting them for current or future use. By implementing such measures on a personal level, we can help reduce our collective impact on the planet while also enhancing its beauty and biodiversity at the same time. Additionally, participating in local green initiatives - such as beach clean-ups, tree plantings, community gardens etc – provides an opportunity to get involved with meaningful activities that promote sustainability while connecting with others who share similar interests too! Furthermore, advocating for greater government investment into renewable energy sources will ensure long-term sustainability across multiple industries despite any short term economic impacts this may have on certain sectors initially dependent on fossil fuels or other nonrenewable energies sources today (such as coal). . . In conclusion, there are many effective ways every individual can contribute towards creating a more sustainable future through lifestyle changes together with increased awareness about environmental issues within society at large – all of which should ultimately lead us towards achieving a healthier relationship between humans and nature going forward!

"The art of woodworking has seen a resurgence in popularity over the last few years. From small businesses to hobbyists, many people are taking up this craft and creating beautiful and useful items from raw materials. With so much available knowledge on the internet, it can be difficult to know where to start when it comes to learning how to make something with wood. Fortunately, there are some basics that any aspiring woodworker should learn before attempting more advanced projects. First, safety is paramount when working with saws and other tools used for cutting or shaping pieces of wood. Investing in protective gear such as gloves, goggles, masks and aprons can help ensure you practice safe techniques without getting injured while you work. It’s also important to do research into the type of wood you plan on using for your project—despite popular belief not all woods are created equal! Different types have different properties that must be taken into consideration if you want your project to turn out well; softwoods like pine may bend easily whereas hardwoods like oak will stand up better against wear-and-tear over time. Once you have settled on a material for your project piece it's time move onto choosing what tools best suit the task at hand—whether that's a miter saw for making precise cuts or an electric drill for boring holes accurately through surfaces. Before starting any job its always wise to inspect each tool carefully first; check that blades are sharp enough and rotating freely without obstruction before plugging them in otherwise serious issues could arise down the line (not only injury but even fires too). Once everything is ready keep fingers away from moving parts whilst they're running!. . Finally before beginning any carpentry adventure double check measurements twice (or even thrice) just incase one wrong step could ruin your entire design idea forever! Taking accurate notes allows makers maintain consistency throughout their build process—no matter how long or short it might take—as well as keeping track of

"The statement that “critical judgment of work in any given field has little value unless it comes from someone who is an expert in that field” implies that the knowledge and experience of a non-expert are irrelevant when evaluating the work of a professional in a specific field. While I agree that expert opinion should carry more weight than that of a layperson, I also believe that non-experts can bring valuable insights to the table.

The traditional view is that only experts have any worth in offering critical judgment. This can be seen in academic writing, where research is only valid if it is conducted by someone with sufficient expertise. Furthermore, those offering professional services such as legal advice or financial guidance must be licensed and certified in the relevant area. It is assumed that any judgment from a non-expert in these fields is likely to be unreliable and uninformed.

However, expert opinion should not be the only factor when considering the value of critical judgment. Those who lack expertise in a given field can still provide a valid opinion, assuming they are approaching the subject in a sensible and informed manner. While a non-expert may lack the technical knowledge that an expert possesses, their opinion can still provide a unique perspective on the work in question. They may be able to identify elements that the expert has overlooked, or offer valuable insights that the expert may have missed.

For example, an expert in web design may have the technical skills to create an attractive website, but they may overlook the importance of usability and content. A non-expert who browses the website could provide an informed opinion on whether the navigation is intuitive and the content is engaging. Although the non-expert may not know the technical aspects of the website design, their opinion on the overall user experience could be incredibly valuable.

Another factor to consider is that expert opinion can be subjective – what one expert finds to be of high quality may not be the same as another. This can be especially true when evaluating creative works such as art, music, or literature. It is quite possible for a non-expert to identify aspects of a creative work that an expert may overlook, or to offer a unique perspective that enriches the discussion.

In conclusion, while expert opinion should be given more weight than that of a non-expert, I believe there is still value to be found in the opinion of a layperson. Non-experts can offer a unique perspective on any given work, and their opinion can help to enrich the discussion. As such, I believe that critical judgment from both experts and non-experts can be beneficial when evaluating a field of work.

"In the contemporary globalized world, our unsustainable reliance on automobiles is becoming increasingly evident. Based on a collection of worldwide studies and experimental projects, there are myriad advantages in taking significant steps to reduce car usage both for individual well-being and environmental health.

The case of Vauban, a German suburb, illustrates a successful example of a variety of benefits that come along with limiting car usage. According to Rosenthal, Vauban has implemented a largely car-free lifestyle where parking is restricted to specific areas and as a result, a majority of families do not own cars (Rosenthal 1-3). A less car-centric environment has manifold advantages such as reduced stress levels, a quieter and safer atmosphere, especially for children, and improved physical health derived from walking and biking (Rosenthal 3). 

Besides the personal benefits, less reliance on cars drastically reduces greenhouse gas emissions which is a critical step towards mitigating climate change (Rosenthal 5). The model of Vauban paves the way for urban planning that prioritizes walkability and public transport access, making the suburbs more compact and reducing the need for parking space (Rosenthal 6). 

On a broader national scale, the impact of reducing car usage can be seen in the example of Bogota, Colombia. Its ""Day Without Cars"", while promoting alternative forms of transport, resulted in a considerable reduction in smog and air pollution (Selsky 21, 24). Similarly, Paris introduced a partial driving ban following near-record levels of pollution, resulting in a subsequent decrease in congestion and smog (Duffer 10, 14). 

In recent times, there has also been a noticeable shift in American behavior towards fewer car purchases and less driving, even among the younger generation (Rosenthal 29, 38). More people are embracing alternative commuting arrangements such as shared van services and car-sharing programs (Rosenthal 35,37). Internet technology and the trend of city center renewal also play a significant role in reducing car usage (Rosenthal 35).

Consequently, limiting car usage is not merely a favor to the environment, but a step towards improved quality of life. Additionally, it impinges positively on urban planning theory and practice by encouraging the development of compact, walkable communities. Importantly, the successful implementation of such practices requires robust political and societal commitment, sustained investment in alternative modes of transport, and a comprehensive public education program emphasizing the personal and environmental benefits of reducing car reliance. Hence, embracing a lesser car-intensive lifestyle can lead us towards a more sustainable, healthier, and happier world.",1

"Education is expensive, but the consequences of a failure to educate, especially in an increasingly globalized world, are even more expensive. Do you agree or disagree?

I believe that education is an important investment, and I believe that it is important for all of us to have the opportunity to receive the education that we need to be successful in the world we live in. However, I also believe that education is expensive. In fact, the cost of education can be quite expensive, depending on the country in which you live. For example, in the United States, the cost of a high school diploma can cost between $12,000 and $24,000. Additionally, many colleges and universities require a significant amount of financial investment, which can lead to a loss of time and money.

I understand that some people may feel that the cost of education is too expensive. I also understand that some people may feel that the cost of education is not enough. I believe that both sides of the argument have a point. I believe that education is important, and I believe that the cost of education is important.

Before making any decisions about getting involved in school activities, it is important to consult with your parents and have a clear understanding of how much time you can realistically dedicate to them. Participating in too many activities can impact your ability to focus on school work, which could result in poor grades. To ensure that parents are comfortable with the amount of activities that you are considering, have a meeting with the school to discuss the extracurricular activities and get parental feedback. Once everyone is on board, you can decide what activities are right for you, while keeping in mind your current workload.",1

At the Seven Oaks School, students must choose the courses for their chosen profession at an early age. This practice has both pros and cons for both the students and their parents. 

On the plus side, this system allows the students to get more in-depth experience in the field they’ve chosen. It also allows the school to tailor its teaching efforts to the needs of the student body since it will already know the courses that need to be taught.

However, this system of course selection can be limiting for students. If their interests or ambitions change over time, they may not have the opportunity to sample courses outside of their chosen profession. Additionally, even when students want to pursue a different career, they may be forced to take courses for their chosen profession.

It is therefore important to weigh the pros and cons before implementing a system of mandatory course selection. After considering the opinion of both students and parents, it is clear that flexibility and personal choice are essential components of a successful school curriculum. Allowing students to choose their courses late in their high school career gives them an opportunity to delve into different fields and discover their true passions.",1
"The importance of well-maintained parks in urban areas cannot be overstated. Parks provide a necessary respite from the hustle and bustle of city life, offering citizens an opportunity to enjoy nature while getting exercise. Adequately maintained parks can also add beauty to cities, increasing property values and fostering community pride. Public green spaces are havens for wildlife, providing habitats for local species as well as migratory birds traveling through our cities on their long journeys. These carefully managed ecosystems also help reduce air pollution by filtering out harmful gases in the atmosphere, helping to create cleaner air for everyone to breathe. Parks’ benefits go beyond just environmental ones; they also have a positive effect on mental health by improving moods and attenuating stress levels. Being surrounded by greenery has been shown to calm people down and make them feel better physically and mentally—even if it’s only a brief visit! Parks are also great places for socializing with friends or meeting new ones; many communities host events such as festivals in these public spaces that bring together diverse groups of people who otherwise may not mix with one another often (if at all). In order for parks to truly realize their potential though, we must ensure that these precious resources remain adequately funded so they can be properly maintained throughout the year with regular pruning of trees and shrubs along pathways or fixing broken playground equipment like swingsets or slides when needed. Additionally, park staff should strive towards making these open spaces more accessible with ADA compliant entrances/exits as well wheelchair accessible pathways where possible so those living with physical disabilities don’t miss out on enjoying what nature has to offer us all!

"Football is an increasingly popular sport, with fans all over the world. It has been played in some form since ancient times and continues to be a source of entertainment today. Football provides both physical and mental stimulation for those who take part in it as well as providing fun for spectators. The modern version of football was first codified in 1863 England when rugby football split from association football through the formation of The Football Association. This act sparked one of the most iconic sports worldwide, bringing people together under their passion for this game each weekend. Many countries now have professional leagues that feature teams from all around the world - each team boasting passionate supporters even thousands of miles away from home. When playing, two teams consisting of 11 players battle against each other on a rectangular field with a goal at either end; they attempt to move an inflated ball into their opponents' goal by kicking or heading it while trying not to let the other score against them! Of course, there are also various rules governing how play progresses but overall it's pretty straightforward: outscore your opponent! As well as these basic rules however, there are numerous strategies and tactics employed during matches which makes them much more entertaining than a simple kickabout between friends! In addition to that there are often particular superstitions held by both players and coaches alike which can add an extra level of intrigue when watching games live or on TV. Particularly when watching at home though what really sets football apart is its ability to bring people together regardless of age or nationality - everyone loves cheering on their favorite team (or sometimes just hoping they don't get thrashed). Furthermore due to its global popularity there's almost always someone willing to talk about the latest scores so you never feel like you're missing out - thereby satisfying our need for social interaction even if we can't physically be near others due to Covid-19 restrictions!

"The world today is a complex and interconnected place. With so many different countries, cultures, and beliefs, it can be difficult to maintain peace and harmony. One way to reduce tension and bias between different countries is through sport events such as the World Cup. I believe that the World Cup can help reduce tension and bias between different countries and keep the peace of the world.

First of all, the World Cup is a great way to bring people together from all over the world. It is a chance for people to come together and celebrate their love of the sport. During the World Cup, people from different countries come together to cheer on their teams and share in the excitement of the tournament. This helps to create a sense of unity and understanding between different countries. It also helps to break down barriers and create a more peaceful atmosphere.

Furthermore, the World Cup is a great way to promote international cooperation. During the tournament, countries must work together to ensure that the event runs smoothly. This helps to foster a sense of cooperation and understanding between different countries. It also helps to create a more peaceful atmosphere, as countries are more likely to work together to solve problems if they have a common goal.

Finally, the World Cup is a great way to promote cultural exchange. During the tournament, people from different countries are exposed to different cultures and customs. This helps to create a better understanding between different countries and can help to reduce tension and bias.

In conclusion, I believe that the World Cup can help reduce tension and bias between different countries and keep the peace of the world. It is a great way to bring people together, promote international cooperation, and promote cultural exchange. By doing so, it can help to create a more peaceful atmosphere and foster a better understanding between different countries.

"I think seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. This is becoz different people have different perspectives and ideas. They can offer a wider variety of options that can be considered before making any decision. Also, some people have more experience and knowledge in certain areas, so their advice can be more valuable.

For example, let's say you are trying to decide which high school to attend. You could ask your parents, a teacher, and a guidance counselor for their opinions. Your parents might have a better sense of your personality and interests, your teacher can offer insights on your academic strengths and weaknesses, and the guidance counselor can provide information on the programs, extracurricular activities, and culture of different high schools. By considering all their advice, you'll make a more informed choice that aligns with your values and goals.

In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions can give you a diverse range of perspectives and help you consider all the options. This can ultimately lead to a better decision that is more suitable for your needs.

"Famous people have always been the center of attention, but with the rise of social media and the internet, their lives are even more exposed. Some people believe that celebrities are treated unfairly by the media and should be given more privacy, while others argue that this is the price they pay for their fame. In my opinion, both sides have valid points, but ultimately, the media should respect celebrities' privacy.

On the one hand, being famous comes with a certain level of public scrutiny. Celebrities are often seen as role models, and their actions can have a significant impact on their fans. Therefore, it is reasonable for the media to report on their behavior and hold them accountable for their actions. For example, when a famous actor is caught driving under the influence, the media has a responsibility to report on it, as it'sends a message that such behavior is not acceptable.

On the other hand, celebrities are human beings, and they deserve some level of privacy. The constant attention from paparazzi and the media can be overwhelming and intrusive, and can even put their safety at risk. Moreover, the pressure to maintain a perfect public image can take a toll on their mental health. For example, Britney Spears' well-documented breakdown in 2007 was partly attributed to the constant media attention she received.

In conclusion, while celebrities do have a certain responsibility to behave in a manner that is appropriate for their public image, they should also be given a level of privacy. The media should respect their personal lives and not cross the boundaries of what is acceptable. Ultimately, it is up to the public to demand better treatment of celebrities, and for the media to be held accountable for their actions.

Working alone or working in a group provides different benefits to student learning. Working alone can provide a student with the distraction-free environment needed to focus and concentrate on a task or assignment. However, working in a group can stimulate a student's creativity and collaboration skills, allowing for a deeper understanding of difficult topics.

When working alone, a student can benefit from undivided attention and full focus on the task at hand. Working alone will also give a student the liberty to use new strategies which would allow them to work through obstacles in their own way. Also, through self-paced learning, the student can gain a sense of fulfillment and accomplishment over the work they have put into completing the task.

On the other hand, when students work in a group, they can take advantage of being able to brainstorm. Students can work together to generate ideas and come up with solutions, usually leading to a deeper understanding of a subject which wouldn’t have been reached when working alone. Working in a group setting can also provide a student with instant feedback from their peers, leading to an improved understanding of the subject being discussed.

In conclusion, both working alone and in a group have their own set of advantages, and each student should take into consideration their own working style when deciding which is best for them. Working alone provides undivided attention and fits better with some student’s learning strategies, while working in a group encourages collaboration and group think which will undoubtedly benefit the student in the long run.",1
"Senator [LastName],

I hope this finds you well. I write to you as a concerned constituent about an issue that defines our democracy: the institution of the Electoral College. While the system has been criticized as undemocratic and outdated, I argue that it still holds significant relevance in preserving fairness and stability in presidential elections.

The Electoral College was established by our founding fathers as a compromise between the election of the President by Congress and by a popular vote (Passage 1). Not just a place, but an intricate process involving the selection of electors, their voting for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.

Opponents of the Electoral College point to the possibility of the popular vote winner losing the presidency due to an imbalance of electoral votes (Passage 9). Indeed, there have been instances where this has happened, two times since 1888, to be precise (Passage 16). However, these cases are extremely rare and should not be the basis for dismantling a centuries-old system. 

Judge Richard A. Posner, in his article ""In Defense of the Electoral College,"" outlines several practical reasons for its preservation. Posner points to the system's tendency to provide a ""Certainty of Outcome"" as one of its key benefits (Passage 17). The Electoral College invariably delivers clear outcomes by awarding a majority of its votes to the winning candidate (Passage 18). The winner-take-all system ensures a definite result, whereas a direct popular vote might be riddled with disputes and recount requests.

Furthermore, the Electoral College forces presidential candidates to broaden their appeal beyond regional boundaries (Passage 19). The necessity of securing electoral votes in various regions prevents a candidate from winning through concentrated regional popularity, thereby encouraging a nation-wide campaign promoting unity and cohesion. This system also directs candidates' focus onto swing states where voters are likely to pay close attention to the campaign, ensuring the most thoughtful voters decide the election (Passage 20).

While it is true that the system tends to favor larger states, this can be viewed as a reset of the political balance that large states lose because of the Senate's mal-apportionment, as Posner argues (Passage 21). The inevitability of a clear outcome helps to avoid run-off elections, simplifying the electoral process (Passage 22).

Some criticisms of the Electoral College are valid, such as with respect to its potential to discourage voters in states dominated by the opposite political affiliation. However, I believe we could remedy this through reforms such as those adopted by Maine and Nebraska which have a ""proportional representation"" system, rather than entirely uprooting the Electoral College.

I urge you to consider the arguments presented while contemplating reforms in our election process. While the electoral college may indeed seem antiquated in some regards, it remains critical to maintaining a unified, nation-wide focus in our Presidential elections.

I look forward to hearing your viewpoint on this matter.

Sincerely,

When researching various countries school requirements for high school graduation, it is important to consider the pros and cons of graduating early. What are the consequences for students that choose to work instead of complete high school? In the USA, once a student turns 18 they are legally allowed to drop out of school. However, some states may require a student to complete certain classes in order to get their high school diploma. Additionally, graduating early can have a number of implications for college and universities. For example, students who graduate early may have difficulties enrolling in college or receiving financial aid.

Additionally, it is important to consider if the current system of classes to complete high school should be changed and how. While the traditional four year system is still largely used by most high schools, some schools are considering new ways of teaching with classes that are shorter in duration and more focused on a particular subject. Ultimately, it is important to consider all of these factors when determining the best high school graduation plan for a young student.",1
"In today's society, it is important to stay informed about current events. With the rise of the internet, there are more ways than ever for individuals to become educated about what is happening in their communities and around the world. One particular example of this phenomenon is environmental conservation efforts. Environmental conservation encompasses a broad range of activities that strive to protect natural resources and maintain biodiversity. Many corporations have begun implementing policies that promote sustainable practices in order to reduce their impact on the environment. These policies often include reducing waste output, utilizing renewable energy sources such as solar power, reusing materials whenever possible, and investing in green technology solutions such as electric vehicles or biodegradable packaging materials. These initiatives help companies produce less pollution while simultaneously decreasing costs associated with production processes. On an individual level, people can also commit to making environmentally conscious decisions by becoming informed about product ingredients or purchasing items made from eco-friendly materials such as organic cotton or hemp fabric instead of synthetic fibers derived from oil-based products like nylon or polyester . Additionally, recycling household waste properly can also make a huge difference when it comes to preventing hazardous substances from entering our water supply or contaminating our soil with plastics and other man-made pollutants . Ultimately, reducing human involvement in damaging ecosystems requires concerted effort from both organizations and individuals alike--it cannot be accomplished alone by any single party involved. Nevertheless , even small actions taken towards preserving nature will contribute positively toward creating a greener tomorrow for everyone!

This transformation rejuvenates the urban landscape, enhancing the overall quality of life for city residents.  Traffic Congestion Reduction: With fewer private cars on the road, traffic congestion is significantly reduced, leading to shorter commutes and a less stressful daily urban experience.  Economic Benefits: Car ownership can be a significant financial burden. By relying less on private vehicles, residents have the opportunity to save money on car-related expenses, contributing to their overall financial well-being.  However, transitioning to car-free cities poses a unique set of challenges:  Resistance to Change: Many individuals heavily rely on their cars for daily activities and commutes. The transition to car-free living may face resistance from those who fear inconvenience and a perceived loss of personal freedom.  Public Transportation Infrastructure: Effective public transportation is essential for the success of car-free cities. Substantial investments are needed to expand and enhance public transit systems, providing convenient alternatives to private cars.  Economic Impact: Businesses that depend on car-dependent customers may experience declining revenues during the transition. Addressing this economic impact and supporting affected businesses is a crucial aspect of the transition.  Urban Planning and Infrastructure: The reconfiguration of urban areas for car-free living demands comprehensive planning and significant investments in infrastructure, a complex and time-consuming process.  Solutions for the successful implementation of car-free cities include expanding and enhancing public transportation, promoting active transportation methods such as walking and cycling, encouraging carpooling and ride-sharing, adopting electric and sustainable transportation options, and focusing on public education and awareness.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer an inspiring vision of a more sustainable, healthier, and community-centric urban future. Despite the challenges, the potential benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, public health, efficient urban living, and cost savings make them a compelling goal. By investing in public transportation, promoting alternative transportation methods, and engaging the public in the planning process, cities can work toward a future where private cars no longer dominate the urban landscape. Car-free cities represent a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment.",1

The beach and the outdoors present a wide variety of activities for everyone to enjoy. Going to the community park can be a great way to unwind, with lots of opportunities to meet new people, take your dog for a walk, and get some fresh air. Training a dog can be both a challenging and rewarding activity, and you'll be able to watch your furry companion learn new tricks and skills. If you have a dog—or want to make one—making friends with other dogs is also a great way to spend time outdoors.

At the beach, there are more opportunities to relax and clear your mind. Take a walk and enjoy the surf, the sun, and the sand between your toes; go swimming, surfing, or paddleboarding; or just sit by the shore and reflect, letting the sound of the waves slow your breathing and soothe your soul.

"The value of community service cannot be overstated. It has the potential to enrich our lives in countless ways and improve the quality of life for everyone involved. Whether it's through volunteering at a local charity, helping out neighbors in need, or engaging in public works projects like park cleanups, there is something hugely rewarding about dedicating your time and energy to making a meaningful contribution to society. Volunteering can provide invaluable experiences we might otherwise never have had. Spending time with those who may not share our same socio-economic backgrounds gives us an opportunity to learn more about people from different walks of life and gain perspective on issues that might not have affected us personally before. In addition to providing new knowledge and insights into other cultures, it can also help build empathy which is incredibly important when trying to solve major challenges such as reducing poverty or inequality, improving access to healthcare services, and addressing environmental concerns like climate change. Of course, giving back doesn't only benefit others; getting involved in community service activities has tangible benefits for ourselves as well! Developing real world skills such as teamwork and problem solving are essential whether you're seeking employment opportunities or simply looking for ways to spend your free time productively – both potential ‘wins’ that come from taking part in volunteer work! Additionally, by building relationships with those within our communities we open up chances for mentoring young adults or developing leadership capabilities; all valuable assets when creating positive social impact . Collectively these experiences can give us a much richer understanding of how small acts add up towards making big changes - something certainly worth striving for!. In conclusion: Community service involvement should be encouraged whenever possible regardless of age or ability level because it provides great personal growth possibilities alongside larger scale societal gains too numerous list here!. Fortunately there are endless opportunities available so you're sure find one that fits your interests - get out there today if you haven't already!

For example, new technologies such as wearable health monitors allow individuals to monitor their own vital signs from home, leading to quicker response times if something goes wrong. Additionally, telemedicine initiatives enable people to consult with physicians remotely over video or phone calls which can greatly reduce wait times at hospitals or doctor’s offices. This is especially beneficial for those living in rural communities who may not have access to quality healthcare close by. In addition to making treatments easier to access, new technologies have also enabled doctors and surgeons perform complex procedures that were once thought impossible. Robotics surgery utilizes robotic arms controlled by a surgeon who operates from a computer console away from the patient's bedside; this makes it possible for surgeries that used be too risky or delicate for manual operation happen safely with less risk of complications than before. Similarly augmented reality applications used during operations provide real-time information on internal organs when overlaid on physical images taken during an endoscopy or ultrasound scans; this allows doctors get accurate data without having open up the body manually thereby reducing trauma inflicted on the patient while increasing accuracy as well as speed of diagnosis/treatment decisions. Thanks in part advancements made by technology our world now has access to better care than ever before; consequently improving outcomes across almost all areas of medicine including cardiovascular disease management motor rehabilitation cancer treatment etc which ultimately impacts countless lives around us every day . Technology will continue its rollout throughout healthcare ensuring patients receive more timely interventions better diagnoses improved quality of life & extended longevity no matter where they reside within our global community!

Having a balanced lifestyle of work and leisure activities is paramount to a healthy, fulfilling life. While work is necessary in order to make money and provide for ourselves and our families, it must be balanced with leisure activities in order to remain happy and healthy. 

Without balance, we can quickly become overwhelmed and burnt out either by dedicating too much of our time to work, or vice versa. Taking on too much work without finding time for leisure activities leads to increased stress and frustration, and can even lead to physical illnesses – such as headaches, fatigue, and a weakened immune system. Conversely, if we are not able to motivate ourselves to work, we will not be able to provide for ourselves and our families, causing immense financial and emotional strain. 

By balancing our work with leisure activities, we are able to remain happy and stress-free. Engaging in hobbies, spending time with friends and family, or even taking a walk around the block can help to relieve stress and create a more positive outlook on life. Furthermore, having the financial security and freedom that comes from being responsible and working hard also increases feelings of contentment.

In conclusion, it is clear that having a balanced lifestyle of both work and leisure activities is beneficial to our overall well-being. Making the conscious effort to maintain a balance lifestyle provides us with a sense of satisfaction, security, and joy.",1

In this day and age, it is important to take the time to carefully consider one’s own character traits and the implications that they can have. Oftentimes, people make snap judgments based solely on the way somebody interacts with others or what they’re wearing on any given day. For example, if someone is wearing bright colors and interacting boisterously, they may be categorized as irresponsible. On the other hand, someone in a more toned-down ensemble and keeping to themselves may be perceived as introverted or shy. It is important to consider that these assumptions are not always accurate, and that each person’s character is unique to them. 

Having a “good character” is a term often used to describe those with admirable traits, such as being honest, generous, and respectful. It’s important to remember that these characteristics are skills, and a person must actively work on honing their character in order to become a better person. Acquiring these skills can help minimize conflict or difficult social interactions, and can make living a happy and successful life much easier. It should be noted that having a good character is not only beneficial for the individual, but also those around them. Friends and family can be more confident in the trustworthiness of the person, and colleagues can potentially become more productive as a direct result. 

It is for these reasons why having a good character is essential in everyday life. In order to ensure that each person is in their best possible state of mind, it is important to take the time and effort to work on the self and improve their character. ",1
"There is no one answer to whether or not major sporting events like the World Cup help reduce tension and bias between different countries and keep the peace of the world. Some people believe that the events bring people together and promote goodwill, while others think that the events can actually lead to more conflict and tension.

I believe that major sporting events can help reduce tension and bias between different countries, but only if the events are organized and conducted in a way that promotes positive international relations. For example, if the countries involved in the event are respectful of each other and display a spirit of cooperation, then the event can help to improve relations between them. On the other hand, if the countries involved are hostile towards each other or there is a lot of competition and rivalry, then the event could actually lead to more tension.

In my opinion, the most important factor in determining whether or not a major sporting event reduces tension and bias between different countries is the way in which the event is conducted. If the event is used as an opportunity to build bridges between different countries and promote positive international relations, then I believe that it can be a success in reducing tension and bias. However, if the event is used to promote nationalism and hostility towards other countries, then it is likely to have the opposite effect.

"Advertisements have become an integral part of our daily lives. They are everywhere - on television, social media, billboards, and even on the packaging of products. However, the question that arises is whether these advertisements are truthful or not. In my opinion, most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are, and in this essay, I will provide specific reasons and examples to support my answer.

Firstly, advertisements often exaggerate the benefits of a product. Advertisers use persuasive language and imagery to make their products seem like the best in the market. For example, a shampoo advertisement may claim to make your hair silky and smooth, but in reality, it may not work as well as advertised. This is because advertisers are trying to sell their products, and they will go to great lengths to make their products seem better than their competitors.

Secondly, advertisements hide the negative aspects of a product. Advertisers focus on the positive aspects of a product and ignore the negative ones. For example, a fast-food chain may advertise their burgers as being delicious and juicy, but they may not mention the high amount of calories and fat in them. This can be misleading for consumers who may not be aware of the negative aspects of the product.

Moreover, advertisements often use models or celebrities to promote their products. These models and celebrities are often airbrushed and edited to look perfect, which can be misleading for consumers. For example, a beauty product advertisement may feature a model with flawless skin, but in reality, the product may not work as well as advertised. This can be frustrating for consumers who have spent money on a product that does not deliver the promised results.

Furthermore, advertisements can create unrealistic expectations for consumers. Advertisers use catchy slogans and jingles to create a positive image of their products. For example, a car advertisement may claim that their car is the best in the market, but in reality, it may not be as good as advertised. This can create unrealistic expectations for consumers who may expect their car to perform better than it actually does.

In conclusion, most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Advertisers use persuasive language, hide negative aspects, use models and celebrities, and create unrealistic expectations to sell their products. It is important for consumers to be aware of these tactics and to do their own research before making a purchase. By doing so, they can make informed decisions and avoid being misled by advertisements.

"Soccer is an exciting and popular sport that has been played in some form for centuries. It is a physical game that incorporates speed, agility, and strategy to score goals against the opposing team. Soccer also requires teamwork to be successful; no single player can win the game alone. This makes soccer a great way for people of all ages to interact with each other while having fun. The rules of soccer are relatively simple, as players must work together to advance the ball downfield and across their opponent's goal line using only their feet or head. The goalkeeper is the only person who can use his hands when defending his net from shots taken by the opposing team. When a shot goes into the goal, one point is earned by whoever scored it- typically awarded to either a forward or midfielder depending on how far away from the goal they were able to shoot it from. There are four quarters in an official match lasting ninety minutes total (each quarter being fifteen). At half time teams switch sides of the field and make adjustments if needed before continuing play in order for both sides have equal opportunity at scoring points during this time period allocated specifically for rest periods called halftimes. In addition to its various rules and regulations governing gameplay, soccer has many different styles of play which help distinguish it apart from other sports activities such as basketball or baseball- namely passing strategies used between teammates while attempting take control over possession within certain parts of field rather than just dribbling around aimlessly like football players do without any real plan established beforehand involving formation shifts where certain personnel move up front so space out defense more evenly allowing easier access through those lanes created due these positional changes accordingly thus creating better chances scoring goals overall since defenders don't know what direction next offensive strike will come from making them less prepared react quicker thereby leaving gaps open during transition times after ball losses occur instead staying organized set positions throughout entire duration contest unlike most traditional sports require much stricter standards constant maneuvering about location order maintain momentum towards desired

"Senator [Name],

I write to you as a student studying the intriguing and complex fabric of American democracy. A considerable debate that I am currently studying is centered around the enduring institution of the Electoral College, a distinctive mechanism our Founding Fathers established for the presidential elections. Within the scope of this discussion, I would like to advocate for the continued use of the Electoral College System, while acknowledging some of the criticisms and limitations inherent in this system.

One of the primary arguments against the Electoral College is that it appears undemocratic, as the president is ultimately elected by electors rather than the popular vote (Posner 15). Critics also emphasize the possibility of elector manipulation and the risk of a presidential election being influenced by ""faithless"" electors (Plumer 11). Notably, criticism has also been focused on the system's unfair concentration on swing states (Plumer 13). While these critiques are well-founded, I would like to offer a multifaceted defense of the Electoral College.

Initially, the certainty of outcome that's inherent in the system is a significant advantage (Posner 18). As with any system, disputes can arise, but they're often less ambiguous due to the Electoral College's structure which often awards a larger proportion of total electoral votes to the victor (Posner 18). Furthermore, the system helps ensure that a president must demonstrate broad appeal, rather than focusing solely on densely populated urban areas or regions where they are most popular (Posner 19). Every state matters under this system, not just the populous ones.

Another key argument in favor of the Electoral College is that it encourages voters in swing states to engage closely with the election process (Posner 20). These voters are central to determining the outcome of the election, which fosters greater political engagement and thoughtful deliberation on the issues at hand. Moreover, the Electoral College offers a counterbalance to potential inequalities presented by Senate apportionment, offering large states more influence in the presidential election (Posner 21).

In my view, an often overlooked advantage of the Electoral College is that it inherently precludes the need for run-off elections, resulting in a clear decision (Posner 22). This, in turn, reduces the complication in the overall presidential election process, contributing to its efficiency. 

Granted, concern exists that voters in staunchly Republican or Democratic states may not vote because the outcome is a foregone conclusion (Posner 23). I would argue, however, that this challenge can be overcome with increased civic education and voter engagement initiatives, emphasizing the value of expressing a political preference through voting. 

To conclude, I believe the Electoral College, uniquely American in its design, remains a viable method for selecting the president. Even though the notion of direct democracy through a direct popular vote seems attractive and simplistically fair, we must consider the practical implications and consequences. It is crucial to ensure the system continues to strike a balance that represents all Americans' interests irrespective of their location. For all its foibles, the Electoral College assures this representation, fostering a federalist and representative democracy that has persevered since our country's inception.

"Grocery Shopping During the Pandemic has Changed Consumer Habits. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in mid 2020 changed how people do almost everything, from going to work and school to grocery shopping. As fears around virus spread increased and stay-at-home orders took effect globally, we saw a dramatic shift in the way society buys food for daily sustenance. Whereas before, grocery shopping amongst crowds was commonplace and simply a part of life, it now requires extra caution and attention to ensure safety from potential exposure. At first, this meant that everyone had to adapt quickly as major retailers limited their hours or closed outright due to staff shortages. This led some shoppers who previously relied on those stores for convenience or deeper discounts into new territory - namely online delivery services such as Instacart or Shipt that had already been growing in popularity pre-pandemic but suddenly became indispensable amid broadened quarantines and social distancing mandates. With these services handling all aspects of selection and delivery while adhering strictly to CDC guidelines regarding personal protective equipment (PPE) use among employees, an entirely new generation of consumers have been able o find comfort in being able shop without ever needing to enter a physical store at all - an option unheard of before now!. . Many other shoppers have decided instead focus more on local businesses like farmers markets or independent grocers where they can support smaller operations securely with less contact involved than bigger chains offer by utilizing curbside pickup options available through many outlets nowdays. By ordering ahead either over phone call or even using special apps designed just for this purpose, customers can pick up their goods with minimal interaction required often avoiding long checkout lines and busy walkways found within traditional supermarkets altogether - something which is especially attractive given what’s at stake healthwise during our current moment worldwide .

"There is no doubt that young people nowadays are more engaged in their own lives and concerns than in helping their communities. This is reflected in the fact that many young people today are more interested in things like social media, their own careers, and their own personal relationships than in volunteering or donating money to charity. While there are certainly some young people who are still very involved in helping their communities, on the whole it'seems that this generation is less engaged than past generations.

There are a number of reasons why young people today may be less likely to help their communities. One reason is that many young people today are cynical and believe that their efforts will not make a difference. Another reason is that young people today are more individualistic and self-focused than in the past, and they are less likely to see the value in helping others. Additionally, many young people today are burdened with debt and other financial concerns, which makes it difficult for them to contribute to charity. Finally, many young people today are simply too busy with their own lives to worry about helping others.

Despite all of these reasons, I believe that young people still have a responsibility to help their communities. Even if they are not able to volunteer or donate money, they can still contribute in other ways, such as by raising awareness about important issues, speaking out against injustice, and networking with other people who are interested in helping their communities. Additionally, young people can set an example for others by being active and engaged members of their communities.

In conclusion, I believe that young people have a responsibility to help their communities, even if they are not able to contribute in the traditional ways. By raising awareness, networking, and setting an example, young people can make a real difference in their communities.

When considering whether to ask one person or multiple people for advice, there are several pros and cons to consider. Asking one person means that individual is likely more familiar with the situation and may be better able to provide specific, detailed advice. Quoting John C. Maxwell: “When I need to make a tough decision, I usually ask one wise person I trust.” On the other hand, asking multiple people for advice can provide a variety of perspectives and insights. As the saying goes, “Two heads are better than one.” Personal anecdotes can also be useful; For example, one person might have asked advice from three friends and found that taking a combination of all their advice was more effective than following any one of them exclusively. 

Overall, I believe that asking one person for advice is the most beneficial. It allows for a more personal and detailed understanding of the situation and potential best course of action. Additionally, the expertise of one trusted individual can often be more reliable than the general consensus of multiple people.",1
"Instant communication systems, such as text messaging and social media, have become increasingly popular in recent years. While these systems can certainly be useful in staying in touch with friends and family, there is some concern that they can lead to hasty opinions and quick replies rather than more thoughtful, well-reasoned points of view. In this essay, I will explain why I disagree with this idea.

First of all, the fact that instant communication systems make it easier to quickly send a message does not necessarily mean that people are forming hasty opinions and giving quick replies. People are still capable of taking the time to think through their words and make sure their point of view is expressed in a thoughtful and well-reasoned manner. In addition, some people actually prefer to take the time to think before responding. For example, some people may take a few moments to compose a thoughtful response and make sure that their message is crystal clear before hitting the “send” button.

Second, there are numerous tools available in instant communication systems that can help people form more thoughtful opinions. For instance, many social media platforms have features that allow users to post their thoughts and opinions and then receive feedback from others. This can be a great way to get different perspectives on a particular topic and can help users form more well-rounded opinions. Additionally, some instant communication systems allow users to share links to articles and other resources that can help them gain a more informed perspective on a particular topic.

Finally, some instant communication systems encourage thoughtful dialogue and discussion. For example, many social media platforms have discussion groups or forums that allow users to communicate with each other and have meaningful conversations about important topics. This allows users to exchange ideas and form more informed opinions on a variety of topics.

In conclusion, while instant communication systems certainly make it easier to quickly send a message, I disagree with the idea that they encourage people to form hasty opinions and give quick replies. In fact, many instant communication systems actually have features that can help people form more thoughtful opinions and engage in meaningful conversations.

"Texting while driving has become a rampant issue in modern society, endangering both drivers and innocent bystanders. While the dangers of texting while driving are well-known, far too many people still take the risk every day. The statistics behind texting and driving paint an alarming picture of how pervasive this activity is - more than 30% of all car accidents involve cell phone use, with 21% involving text messaging specifically. That adds up to 3 thousand deaths per year resulting from distracted driving alone, not to mention hundreds of thousands more injuries each year due to phones taking priority over safety on the road. Texting behind the wheel can be as dangerous as impaired or reckless driving because it takes eyes and attention off the road for long periods at a time. The consequences that come from being caught texting while operating a vehicle can vary greatly depending on where you live; however they usually include hefty fines or even jail time in extreme cases. This combined with potential civil liability if someone is hurt could result in tremendous costs incurred by those who choose to ignore such laws out of carelessness or negligence. The best way to prevent such costly mistakes is simply avoiding any usage whatsoever when behind the wheel; hands free options exist for those times when talking on your phone cannot wait until you reach your destination safely. Ultimately, no matter what state we live in or how tough its penalties may be - following these laws should not only be done out of respect for life but also financial sensibilities as well: preventing yourself from becoming one more statistic means protecting your wallet along with everything else!

"Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my views regarding the current mode of selecting the President of the United States, namely the Electoral College, and voices calling for its replacement with a direct popular vote. While I understand criticisms of the Electoral College system, for reasons I will outline below, I maintain that it should be preserved.

The Electoral College, established by the founding fathers as a compromise, serves critical roles in electing the President (Office of the Federal Register). As Bradford Plumer notes, critics of the Electoral College argue that the structure allows for rejection of the popular will, especially in ""winner-takes-all"" states. Yet, while this has occurred occasionally, it is relatively rare (Judge Richard A. Posner). Moreover, Judge Posner argues that the Electoral College ensures a decisive and certain outcome, thus minimizing election disputes. If we were to transition to a popular vote, outcome disputes might increase, causing more confusion and discord.

Critics argue the Electoral College unfairly contains candidates to ""swing states,"" thereby preventing candidates from appealing to nationwide voters. The impartial observer, however, might view this as the system compelling candidates to consider and appeal to a broad spectrum of states and voters, rather than focusing on densely populated urban centers. It forces the candidates to have a more trans-regional appeal, fostering the perception of a ""Everyone's President"" (Judge Posner). 

By maintaining the Electoral College, we also avoid the need for run-off elections when no candidate secures a majority of votes, as Posner points out. This mechanism invariably produces a clear winner, regardless of whether the candidate secures a popular vote majority, thereby eliminating the complications runoff elections impose on the selection process.

The Electoral College also compensates for the inequality in representation among states in the Senate. To illustrate, a close victory in populous Florida carries more weight, in terms of electoral votes, than a similar margin in less populous Wyoming (Judge Posner). This balance can help ensure large states receive more attention from candidates.

In conclusion, the Electoral College, while imperfect, is essential for maintaining a balance of power among the states and ensuring a clear election outcome. While it's important to recognize and speak to the frustrations some have with the system, I urge you to defend the continuation of the Electoral College in our presidential elections. 

Thank you for considering my perspective on this consequential issue.

Sincerely,

"The internet has brought about a revolution in the field of information and communication, and it's impact on our lives is undeniable. It has transformed the way we obtain and share information, and has made it more accessible to individuals all over the world. However, the question remains whether it will ever replace books and the written word as the primary source of information. In my opinion, while the internet has it's benefits, it is unlikely to replace books and the written word entirely.

Firstly, books have been around for centuries and have served as an essential source of information and knowledge for people. They are tangible and can be easily accessed without the need for electricity or an internet connection. Moreover, books provide a more immersive reading experience than the internet, as they allow individuals to engage with the material in a dedicated manner without any distractions.

Secondly, the internet has an overwhelming amount of information available, making it difficult to distinguish reliable sources of information from unreliable ones. In contrast, books have gone through a more rigorous publishing process and have undergone editorial scrutiny before being released to the public. This means that books are often more trustworthy sources of information than the internet.

Lastly, the act of reading a book is a more active and engaging experience than passively scrolling through web pages. When we read a book, we are forced to focus our attention and actively engage with the material. This results in better retention of information and a deeper understanding of the subject matter.

However, this is not to say that the internet is without it's advantages. It is a highly efficient and convenient way to access information quickly, and it allows for a vast range of information to be available to individuals all over the world.

In conclusion, while the internet has undoubtedly transformed the way we obtain and share information, it is unlikely to replace books and the written word entirely. Books have been around for centuries and have served as a trusted source of information for people. Moreover, the act of reading a book provides a more immersive and engaging experience than the internet. However, the internet has it's advantages and is a highly efficient and convenient way to access information quickly. Ultimately, both books and the internet have their merits, and both will continue to coexist as crucial sources of information for individuals.

    Ralph Waldo Emerson once famously said, “To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.” This statement epitomizes the importance of individuality in life, as it lays out the struggles of being oneself in a world full of people trying to conform you to their expectations. 

My own personal experience helps me understand this statement, especially in my teenage years. With the stress of school and navigating social relationships, I found myself trying to fit into what everyone else expected of me. But I quickly learned that nothing was worth compromising my own individual values and desires for. By making decisions that reflected my own individualistic preferences, I gained a sense of peace and self-confidence. 

Ultimately, it is important to stay true to oneself in spite of the world around them. While it can be difficult, it is essential if we want to enjoy a meaningful, fulfilling journey through life. Knowing who we are and standing up for our individualistic values will allow us to achieve the greatest possible amount of personal satisfaction. ",1

The work ethics of some of the world's greatest athletes have a direct effect on their success. Larry Bird, Michael Jordan, Lebron James, and Walter Payton have exemplified how hard work plays a significant role in reaching success. Each of these basketball players have made history through their hard work and drive, from Larry Bird's intense competitiveness and understanding of the game, to Michael Jordan's relentless practice routines and will to win any way he could, to Lebron James's focused mentality and ability to push himself, and Walter Payton's relentless work ethic and drive. 

Comparatively, someone who is idle or expects things to come to them is likely not to reach the same level of success as those who put in the effort. Working hard requires concentration, dedication, and a willingness to put yourself in uncomfortable situations to reach your goals. When one puts in the hard work, they can expect to be rewarded with tangible results correlating to their efforts. It is important to note that the work ethics of these athletes are not only applicable to sports, but also to life as a whole. When one works hard, they can almost always expect to be rewarded.",1

Excerpt:
    The proverb “Honesty is the best policy” is often viewed as an ideal for how we should behave. Honesty implies a commitment to telling the truth, no matter the consequences. While being honest can sometimes lead to hurt feelings or a loss of trust, it can also create positive benefits in multiple areas. On the other hand, dishonesty often carries negative repercussions because it involves stealing, cheating, lying, and hiding important facts. To summarize, being honest is always preferable to dishonesty. In every situation, it is best to remain truthful, even if it means navigating difficult conversations or enduring lasting damage to a relationship.",1
"Beauty pageants have long been a popular form of entertainment, but there is much debate over their purpose and value in our society. Beauty pageants can provide an opportunity to celebrate physical characteristics such as beauty, poise, grace and confidence while considering the culture and values that are represented by the contestants. However, they also risk objectifying women and promoting unattainable standards of beauty that are unhealthy for body image. The positives of beauty pageants should not be ignored. By highlighting qualities like intelligence, confidence, charisma and kindness during competitions it encourages young girls to develop these traits in themselves too - providing them with skills that would otherwise take years to acquire. Pageant winners become role models for other young girls who may look up to them and strive to achieve similar accomplishments in life. On the flip side though it is important to consider the issues associated with beauty pageants like issues surrounding gender identity, race diversity or size acceptance which place heavy emphasis on conforming within certain parameters set by external forces outside their control . This could lead young children towards developing low self-esteem or unrealistic expectations about their bodies from an early age. Furthermore if only one type of ""ideal"" woman was being displayed at all times then this could negatively impact upon those who do not fit into this narrow definition due to criteria such as age or skin colour etc., leading some people feeling marginalized or excluded from participating altogether thus reinforcing various stereotypes about different types of people including gender roles imposed on both men & women which can perpetuate inequality between genders. Ultimately whether we view beauty pageants positively or negatively depends on how they are used; although they can be entertaining when done responsibly they run the risk of propagating ideas about what constitutes “perfection” that don't always reflect reality nor benefit all members of society equally. It is essential therefore that any potential negative impacts should be highlighted where possible so as not create damaging impressions on impressionable minds!

"Some people think that playing video games is a waste of time, but recent research has shown that it can provide numerous benefits. By engaging with the right types of video games, players can boost their problem solving skills and even improve their hand-eye coordination. Video gaming has become an increasingly popular pastime in recent years due to its affordability and accessibility. Additionally, new technological advancements have resulted in more sophisticated graphics, realistic sound effects and a larger variety of game genres such as first person shooters (FPS), strategy or puzzle titles. Contrary to popular belief, playing video games does not necessarily detract from other activities; rather it enhances one’s ability to focus on whatever task they are currently working on. This could be attributed to the fact that gamers must develop quick reflexes while learning how best to approach different obstacles within the virtual world they inhabit. The cognitive load experienced by players also encourages them to carefully assess each situation before making any decisions which further develops critical thinking skills outside of their gaming experience itself. Studies conducted at Harvard University show that certain “action” type video games – those focused on speed and accuracy – help players improve their spatial navigation abilities as well as motor agility and control over fine motor movements such as typing or handwriting tasks . In turn these beneficial effects spillover into daily life when gamers face real-world challenges requiring similar skill sets; for instance some surgeons report faster response times during operations after regularly indulging in FPS titles prior to performing surgery procedures . Furthermore, psychologists believe that difficult levels encountered during gameplay cause stress levels in gamers rise which could lead them feeling more prepared for similar stressful situations outside of the gaming environment e.g., school exams or job interviews since they are used toovercoming stressful scenarios within a virtual space where failure doesn't have long lasting consequences like it would IRL situations .

"There are two schools of thought when it comes to the media and how it covers famous people. Some people think that the famous people are given an unfair shake and that they should be given more privacy. Other people believe that this is the price of their fame. I agree with the latter opinion.

Famous people are in the public eye by choice. They have chosen to put themselves out there and be in the spotlight. With that choice comes the understanding that they are going to be subject to more scrutiny than the average person. The media is going to be interested in their every move and they are going to have to get used to having their lives dissected in the public eye.

This is not to say that the media is always fair in it's coverage of famous people. There are times when the media can be unfair and intrusive. However, this is the price of fame. Famous people have to accept that they are going to be under a microscope and that they are not going to be able to have the same level of privacy as everyone else.

In conclusion, I believe that the price of fame is that famous people have to give up some privacy. They have chosen to be in the public eye and they should accept the consequences that come with that choice.

"Title: The Face on Mars: A Natural Landform, Not Alien Artifact

Introduction:

For decades, the Face on Mars has captured the imagination of people around the world. Some have claimed it as evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence or a long-lost Martian civilization. However, NASA scientists have repeatedly explained that this intriguing feature is merely an illusion caused by shadows and lighting conditions. This essay will present claims and evidence supporting the conclusion that the Face on Mars is a natural landform, not an alien artifact.

Body:

Claim 1: NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft first photographed the Cydonia region in 1976, revealing the Face.

Evidence: According to the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" the Viking 1 orbiter captured several images of Mars, including one of the Cydonia region where the Face appears. These photos were taken at low resolution due to technical limitations, which contributed to the blurred and distorted appearance of the Face.

Claim 2: Higher-resolution images taken by later missions reveal the true nature of the Face.

Evidence: As technology advanced, NASA launched subsequent missions with improved cameras, such as the Mars Global Surveyor in 1997 and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter in 2006. The new images showed that the Face was not a distinct structure but rather a mesa—a flat-topped mountain—with eroded slopes and shadows that create the illusion of facial features under certain light conditions.

Claim 3: Pareidolia—the human tendency to perceive familiar patterns in random data—explains why some people see a face in the Martian landscape.

Evidence: Psychologists and neuroscientists have studied pareidolia, demonstrating how our brains are wired to recognize faces even when they do not exist. This phenomenon can lead us to see faces in clouds, rock formations, or even toast. In the case of the Face on Mars, our brains interpret random shadows and shapes on the Martian surface as eyes, nose, and mouth.

Conclusion:

The Face on Mars has intrigued people for decades, sparking debates about possible alien civilizations. However, NASA's repeated explanations and high-resolution imagery confirm that the Face is merely an optical illusion caused by natural geological processes, not an artificial structure created by extraterrestrial beings. By understanding pareidolia and examining the evidence, we can appreciate the beauty",1
"During the '70s Vance Packard sustained that advertisements is fake, is something that persuades every single customer and make him/her buy a product even if he/she doesn't need it or is not interested in.

I don't agree with this statement. I think that most of the time, advertisements are not misleading at all. In fact, they can be very helpful. For example, if you are looking for a new car, you might see an advertisement that says that the car is the best in the world and you should buy it. You might also see advertisements that say that you can save money by buying this or that product. These advertisements can help you make a better decision about what you want to buy. However, it is important to remember that there are many factors that go into making a good decision, such as price, quality, safety, reliability, and so on. If you have any doubts about any of these factors, then it might be better to avoid buying the product in question.

"Touring is a great way to see a lot of different places in a short amount of time. However, some people feel that tour guides are a necessary part of the travel process. A tour guide is a person who takes you around and shows you all of the sights and attractions in a particular area. They can also give you tips on where to go next or where to find things.

Some people feel that tour guides are a necessary part of the travel process because they can provide a lot of information and help you plan your trip. Additionally, tour guides can help you feel more comfortable in new surroundings. If you have never been on a tour before, it is important to ask a tour guide about the different types of tours that are available.

The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. You can find a tour guide through online search engines or by asking friends. If you are not comfortable traveling with a tour guide, you can always take a group tour instead. A group tour is a great way to see a lot of different places in a shorter amount of time.

"When it comes to the role of family dynamics in childhood obesity, there is an undeniable link between the two. Research has proven that parents and other caregivers who are not supportive or provide unhealthy environments can contribute to the development of obesity in children. A familial environment that is highly focused on pleasing others and providing material items instead of showing proper nutrition habits or encouraging physical activity can be detrimental to a child's health. One way families can prevent childhood obesity from occurring is by having regular conversations about healthy food options and physical activities. These conversations should include topics such as the importance of eating nutrient-rich foods like fruits and vegetables rather than junk food, limiting screen time, participating in outdoor activities, setting attainable goals for exercising regularly, etc. Parents need to emphasize how these messages will benefit their child's overall wellbeing while also respecting any opinion they may have on certain lifestyle choices that could impact their weight status. Another important factor when it comes to preventing childhood obesity in families is creating a positive home environment without judgement or criticism regarding body image issues — particularly with young girls who tend to struggle more with self-esteem issues related to weight gain due to societal pressures placed upon them at an early age. It's essential for caregivers within a household to promote acceptance no matter what size or shape someone may be so children do not feel ashamed if they put on additional pounds due solely genetics or puberty changes for example. Finally, having frequent check-ins with your pediatrician concerning your child's growth rate will help you identify any potential problems before they become serious enough warrant medical attention from specialists outside your primary care physician office . This step also allows you track trends over several visits; this will give you peace of mind knowing whether changes made within your household during this time frame had any affect either positively or negatively on their Body Mass Index (BMI). In conclusion, family dynamics play an integral part when it comes down preventing childhood obesity through education , support , communication and monitoring .

Graduating from high school in three years instead of the traditional four could be a game changer for students. One of the greatest potential advantages of graduating one year earlier is the ability to start an exciting career path a year earlier. For students interested in a technical or professional field, being able to jump-start their education and begin working towards their dream career a year earlier can open many doors in a much shorter amount of time. 

Another potential advantage of graduating almost a year sooner is the potential for financial freedom. By finishing school early and entering the job market earlier, students have the potential to make more money each year, thus allowing them to save more and support their family sooner while leading a more comfortable financial life. This can reduce the amount of debt students need to accumulate and potentially decrease the amount of time needed to pay off any debt. 

Finally, an earlier graduation date also has the potential to give students more time to dedicate to their family. Students graduating early are able to have more free time to return to their home town and spend quality time with their family and loved ones and help build stronger emotional connections with their roots. Graduating sooner gives students the opportunity to travel home more often and strengthen those connections in a much shorter amount of time.

In conclusion, graduating from high school in three years instead of the traditional four can open many doors for students in terms of career, family, and financial freedom. Therefore, it is beneficial for high school students to take this opportunity and accelerate their education to be able to benefit from these potential advantages.",1
"The age-old debate about whether younger people or older people enjoy life more is one that has been argued for centuries. While it is impossible to definitively answer this question, there are a few points that can be made to support either side. On the one hand, it can be argued that younger people enjoy life more than older people do because they have fewer responsibilities, more energy, and a greater sense of optimism. On the other hand, it can be argued that older people enjoy life more than younger people do because they have more wisdom, experience, and appreciation for life.

To begin with, younger people tend to have fewer responsibilities than older people, which allows them to enjoy life more. They do not have to worry about paying bills, managing a career, or taking care of children. Instead, they can focus on having fun and exploring different activities. They can travel, go out with friends, and try new things without the worry of having to make a living or provide for a family. This freedom allows them to experience life more fully and enjoy it to the fullest.

In addition, younger people tend to have more energy and enthusiasm than older people. They are typically more active and adventurous, and they are often willing to take risks and try new things. This can lead to exciting experiences and a greater sense of enjoyment. For example, a young person may be more likely to go bungee jumping or skydiving than an older person, which can lead to an exhilarating and memorable experience.

Finally, younger people tend to have a greater sense of optimism than older people. They are often less jaded and more open to new experiences. They may be more likely to take chances and explore different possibilities, which can lead to a greater sense of satisfaction and enjoyment. This can be seen in the way they approach life, as they tend to be more optimistic and enthusiastic about the future.

On the other hand, older people may enjoy life more than younger people do because they have more wisdom, experience, and appreciation for life. They have likely been through many different experiences, both good and bad, and this has allowed them to gain a greater understanding of life. They may also be more likely to appreciate the simple things in life, such as spending time with family or taking a walk in nature. This appreciation can lead to a greater sense of contentment and enjoyment.

In addition, older people tend to have more financial stability than younger people, which can lead to a greater sense of security and enjoyment. They may have more money saved up and have the financial resources to do the things they want to do. This can lead to a greater sense of freedom and satisfaction, as they are not limited by their financial situation.

In conclusion, it is impossible to definitively answer the question of whether younger people or older people enjoy life more. However, there are certain points that can be made to support either side. Younger people tend to have fewer responsibilities, more energy, and a greater sense of optimism, while older people tend to have more wisdom, experience, and appreciation for life. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide which age group enjoys life more, as everyone’s experiences are different.

"There are many different opinions on the purpose of university education. Some people believe that it prepares students for employment, while others believe that it has other functions. I believe that the university education has both purposes.

First, the university education prepares students for a variety of different careers. This is important because many jobs are not available to people who have only a high school diploma or a less-than-adequate college education. Second, the university education provides students with the skills they need to be successful in their careers.

Winston Churchill's quote ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts"" is one of the most inspiring quotes of the modern era. On one hand, Churchill's quote highlights the fact that success, while valuable, is not static and there is always more to be done. This encourages individuals to strive for continuous improvement and progress in their lives. On the other hand, Churchill's quote isn't complete without addressing failure. To achieve success one must not be discouraged by failure, but to use it as a learning experience and keep going with determination and courage. 

I relate to this quote personally; when I was in graduate school, I struggled to keep up with my classes and often felt adrift. However, I used Churchill's words as a source of hope and motivation; regardless of my failures, I had the courage to push on and eventually graduate with much success. This quote spoke to me directly and showed me that failure was just a necessary step in the journey to success. 

Ultimately, Churchill's quote is a potent reminder that it is never too late to start again and to continue striving for excellence no matter the setbacks encountered. No matter how difficult the journey becomes, the courage and determination to continue will allow one to eventually reach their goals.",1
"History has the unfortunate tendency to amplify the significance of individual people, while often overlooking the accomplishments of groups of people who have contributed to the overall trajectory of society. While it is true that some individuals have had remarkable influence on history, it is often the collective efforts of the masses that have enabled the most significant events and trends in history.

To begin with, without the collective power of the people, many of history’s most iconic figures would not have been able to achieve greatness. Take for example the American Revolution. While individuals such as George Washington and Thomas Jefferson are rightly remembered for their contributions to the cause, it is important to remember that the revolutionary cause was only possible due to the united front of the American people. Without their collective effort and bravery, the Revolution may not have been successful.

Similarly, the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 60s was led by a group of courageous individuals, the most notable of which was Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. However, the movement would not have been as successful as it was without the collective effort of millions of African Americans who protested peacefully and worked to bring about equality between races. The courage of these individuals is often forgotten, yet it was their collective strength that enabled this momentous event to take place.

Lastly, it is important to recognize the significance of the many anonymous people who have shaped the course of history. For example, the industrial revolution of the 19th century is often credited to individuals like the British economist Adam Smith. Yet the people who worked in the factories, contributing their labor and ingenuity, are rarely remembered. Similarly, the invention of computers and the internet is often attributed to inventors like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, yet it is the hundreds of brilliant scientists and engineers who worked on the technology that enabled these inventions to become a reality.

In conclusion, it is important not to overlook the collective efforts and accomplishments of the people who have shaped history. While individuals can certainly have an impact, it is often the collective efforts of those whose names are lost to history that have enabled the most significant events and trends in history to take place.

Summer vacations provide teens with a unique opportunity to take a break from the normal routine of the academic year and spend more time with their friends and family. Studies have found that longer summer vacations have many benefits, such as providing more time for socialization, improving mood and cognition, and broadening opportunities for exploration and discovery. Additionally, longer summer vacations can help strengthen family bonds, as teens are able to spend more quality time with their parents, siblings, and extended family.

However, there are potential drawbacks associated with longer summer vacations. Teens who have a lengthy amount of time away from school-related activities and responsibilities may experience a drop in academic performance, as disruptive behavior can manifest from boredom. Without the structure of school, teens may also fall into negative habits, such as reckless decision-making or addiction to social media and other electronic devices.

In conclusion, the advantages and disadvantages of longer summer vacation must be taken into consideration by families. If planned and organized in concert with parents and school staff, longer summer vacations can be beneficial for teens as they can spend more time with their family and friends. At the same time, the right balance of structure and autonomy should be observed to ensure that teens can make the most of their time away from school.",1
"While studying Venus presents clear dangers due to its extreme environment, the author makes a compelling case that such exploration is nonetheless a worthy pursuit. The key evidence provided supports this claim.

One of the most compelling pieces of evidence the author provides is the sheer scientific value that can be gained from studying Venus. As Earth's sister planet, Venus holds clues that can help scientists better understand planetary evolution and the possibilities for life elsewhere in the universe. Venus presents an opportunity to gain valuable insights into atmospheric chemistry, volcanism, climate change, and other planetary processes. This potential for scientific discovery is incredibly valuable, particularly as humanity looks to expand its understanding of our solar system and beyond. 

Further evidence presented is Venus's potential similarity to Earth in its earliest years. The author notes Venus may have once had liquid water on its surface before a runaway greenhouse effect transformed the planet. Studying Venus up close could thus yield new understandings of Earth's own early history and climate. With concerns growing over climate change effects here on Earth, the parallels to and lessons from Venus's climate transformation are hugely significant from a scientific perspective.

While the extreme heat, toxic atmosphere, and lack of surface accessibility on Venus present undeniable challenges and dangers, the author makes a persuasive case that the potential scientific rewards of exploring this planet outweigh these risks. From gaining new knowledge applicable to climate science and the search for life elsewhere, to illuminating planetary evolution and early Earth, the scientific value of Venus studies is immense according to the evidence presented. In this way, the author provides strong support for the assertion that studying Venus remains a worthy pursuit despite its difficulties. The profound scientific insights to be gained, as evidenced in the article, demonstrate why continuing exploration of our closest planetary neighbor is so important.",1
"When faced with an important decision, it is wise to seek advice from more than one person. Getting different perspectives allows you to view the situation from various angles and take multiple factors into consideration. While one person may provide useful insights, they can only offer their single point of view. By talking to multiple people, you gain a more well-rounded understanding of your options and their potential consequences.

Different people often have complementary areas of expertise and life experiences that can shed light on aspects of a decision you may not have thought about on your own. One friend may give advice focused on finances or career implications, while another considers family or relationships. A family member could bring a emotional perspective, and a co-worker shares an insider's view of work-related issues. Combining the specialized knowledge and observations of several people allows for a more comprehensive analysis than any one person alone could provide. 

It is also important to talk to people who don't have the same biases or agendas. Close friends and relatives may want to be supportive but their advice could be clouded by personal feelings toward you. Hearing from acquaintances or impartial professionals ensures a range of impartial, objective viewpoints enter the discussion. Getting input from individuals with no stake in the outcome means you benefit from frank, unfiltered guidance untainted by hidden motives or the desire to please.

No single person knows everything, so seeking multiple opinions acknowledges the limitations of human perspective and experience. The diversity of viewpoints, each with their own merits, allows you to weigh full scope of factors thoroughly and make the choice most aligned with your best interests and true needs. In the end, synthesizing varied counsel leads to wiser, better-informed decisions.",1
"There is no one answer to the question of whether or not famous people are treated unfairly by the media. Some people may feel that celebrities are unfairly targeted by the media and should be given more privacy, while others may feel that this is the price of their fame. Ultimately, this is a personal decision that each individual must make.

There are a number of reasons why people might feel that celebrities are treated unfairly by the media. One reason is that the media often focuses on the negative aspects of celebrities' lives, rather than the positive. For example, the media may report on a celebrity's divorce or financial troubles, rather than their accomplishments. This can be frustrating for celebrities, who often feel that they are being judged unfairly.

Another reason why people might feel that celebrities are treated unfairly by the media is that the media often publishes private information about celebrities without their consent. This can be embarrassing or damaging to celebrities, and it can be difficult for them to rebuild their privacy once it has been violated.

Despite these valid concerns, there are also a number of reasons why people might feel that celebrities are treated fairly by the media. One reason is that celebrities often choose to be in the public eye, and they understand that they will be subject to scrutiny. Additionally, the media often reports on positive news stories about celebrities, such as their charitable work or accomplishments.

Another reason why people might feel that celebrities are treated fairly by the media is that the media often provides a platform for celebrities to share their thoughts and opinions. This can be beneficial for both the celebrities and the public, as it allows the public to learn more about the celebrities' thoughts and beliefs.

Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to believe that celebrities are treated unfairly by the media is a personal one. Some people may feel that the media is unfair to celebrities, while others may feel that the media is fair. Each individual must decide what they believe based on their own personal experiences and beliefs.

"Limiting car usage can provide significant benefits to both individuals and communities. Reducing the number of vehicles on the road each day improves quality of life in several key ways. 

One advantage is improved air quality. As passages 1 and 2 discuss, vehicle emissions are a major contributor to air pollution in many cities. Pollution from cars and trucks puts public health at risk by increasing levels of particulate matter and greenhouse gases. Fewer vehicles mean lower emissions and cleaner air for everyone to breathe. With less pollution, people are less likely to suffer from respiratory illnesses.

Another benefit is reduced traffic congestion. As stated in passage 3, heavy traffic waste time and fuel as vehicles get stuck in jams. By driving less, there will be fewer cars competing for limited road space. This allows essential vehicles like emergency responders to reach their destinations more quickly in an emergency. It also saves commuters time each day that would otherwise be spent idling in traffic. That extra free time has value and improves people's overall well-being.

Limiting car use also encourages active transportation modes. As passage 2 discusses, biking, walking and public transit are healthier and more sustainable options. With fewer vehicles on the road, more people may feel safe biking or choose to walk short distances rather than drive. This gets individuals moving and burning calories each day, reducing risks of obesity and other health issues. It also lessens societal dependence on non-renewable gasoline. 

In summary, curbing excessive personal vehicle usage produces a cleaner, less congested environment while promoting public health benefits. Minor reductions by many individuals can make a meaningful difference community-wide. By informing citizens of these important advantages, more people may choose alternative transportation in their daily routines.",1
"Passage 1: ""Cars are the main source of air pollution in cities, causing harmful levels of nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter, according to a study by the European Public Health Alliance (EPHA). The report, which analysed data from more than 400 cities, found that 10% of the urban population are living in areas with “dangerously high” levels of these pollutants, with diesel vehicles the main culprit.""

Passage 2: ""The city of Madrid has launched a plan to reduce traffic and improve air quality. The scheme will ban most petrol and diesel cars from the center of the city as early as November and will be fully implemented by 2020. The initiative is designed to reduce nitrogen dioxide levels by 40% and has been praised by both Greenpeace and the European Commission. The mayor of Madrid, Manuela Carmena, said: “We need to reclaim the center of the city for the use of the people, not the cars.”

Passage 3: ""The city of Oslo has set a goal of becoming car-free by 2030. The Norwegian capital will ban all cars from the city center and invest heavily in public transport and infrastructure for cyclists and pedestrians. The plan is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50% and improve air quality. The mayor of Oslo, Marianne Borgen, said: “We want to have a car-free city center. We want to make it better for walkers, cyclists. It will be a better city to live in.”

Passage 4: ""The city of Paris has launched a bike-sharing scheme called Vélib. The initiative, which has been hugely successful, allows residents and visitors to rent bikes for short journeys around the city. The scheme has been credited with reducing traffic congestion, improving air quality and promoting healthy living. The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, said: “We need to change the way we move around the city. We need to reduce the number of cars on the roads and promote sustainable modes of transport.”

Limiting car usage can have many advantages, both for individuals and for society as a whole. Firstly, it can help to reduce air pollution, which is a major health concern in many cities around the world. As the first passage highlights, cars are the main source of air pollution in urban areas, causing harmful levels of nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter. By",1
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. This is evident in various case studies and trends around the world that demonstrate the positive impact of reducing car dependency.

One notable example is Vauban, a suburb in Germany, where residents have given up their cars. The community is designed to be car-free, with limited parking spaces at the edge of the development. As a result, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57 percent of residents sold their cars in order to move there. This drastic reduction in car ownership has led to happier residents, like media trainer and mother Heidrun Walter, who says she is ""much happier this way"" without a car. This example shows that limiting car usage can improve quality of life for individuals.

Furthermore, reducing car usage is crucial in the effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions, with passenger cars alone accounting for 12 percent of emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage, we can significantly reduce these emissions and mitigate the impact of climate change.

Studies in the United States suggest that Americans are already driving less and buying fewer cars, indicating a potential shift in behavior and a decrease in car dependency. This trend is beneficial for the environment, as transportation is a major source of emissions. It also has implications for the car industry, with companies like Ford and Mercedes rebranding themselves as ""mobility"" companies to adapt to changing consumer preferences.

In addition to environmental benefits, limiting car usage can also have positive effects on urban planning and public transportation. Planners are now taking the concept of car reduction to the suburbs, making them more compact and accessible to public transportation. This approach prioritizes walkability and reduces the need for vast parking lots and highways. By creating communities with easy access to stores and public transportation, we can promote a more sustainable and efficient use of space.

International examples also demonstrate the advantages of limiting car usage. Paris enforced a partial driving ban to combat high levels of pollution, leading to a 60 percent decrease in congestion. Bogota, Colombia, implemented a car-free day, showcasing the success of alternative transportation options such as buses, taxis, and bicycles. These initiatives not only reduce emissions and improve air quality but also promote healthier and more active lifestyles.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can bring numerous advantages, ranging from improved quality of life for individuals to mitigating climate change and promoting sustainable urban planning. The examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota demonstrate the positive impact of reducing car dependency through measures such as creating car-free communities, implementing driving bans, and promoting alternative transportation options. By embracing policies and behaviors that limit car usage, we can create a more sustainable and livable future.",1

Many people face the difficult decision of choosing a career at a young age, and it can certainly be beneficial to start taking steps in a desired direction at a young age. For example, I know a teenaged girl who is already learning valuable skills in coding, which could give her an edge in future job markets. However, some argue that deciding a career path at an early age can lead to regret or lack of opportunity further down the line. Those who wait until later in life to get a degree or who change fields as they age often have a well-rounded understanding of the world and their particular interests, and can find more fulfilling work. My grandmother, for example, devoted most of her twenties to travel and charity work, and decided later to pursue a career in the art world. In conclusion, while it is possible to find success by selecting a career at a young age, it can also be beneficial to wait until later in life to gain a better understanding of the world and one's passions.",1
"There is no doubt that advertisements can make products seem much better than they really are. For example, an ad for a new car may show a beautiful woman driving down a picturesque road, with the sun shining and the wind in her hair. In reality, the car may be a piece of junk that breaks down all the time.

However, there are also many cases where the product is actually as good as the advertisement says it is. For example, a toothpaste commercial may show a person brushing their teeth and having white, healthy teeth. In reality, the toothpaste may actually be able to make teeth whiter.

There is no easy answer when it comes to whether advertisements make products seem better than they really are. It depends on the product and the advertisement. Some products may be as good as the advertisement says they are, while others may not be.

"When it comes to the importance of physical education, there is no question that it is an essential part of a student's life. Physical education provides students with the opportunity to learn about both their individual and collective physical potentials. It helps them develop body awareness and teaches them how to use their bodies in a safe and effective manner. This knowledge can then be transferred over into other aspects of life such as school, work, or social activities. Physical education encourages healthy habits in children from an early age by helping them understand why particular activities are important for maintaining proper health - whether through teaching concepts like nutrition or managing stress through physical activity. During class time, teachers provide instruction on various topics such as anatomy, biomechanics, exercise physiology, motor development theory and skill-related fitness components (agility/balance/coordination etc.). In addition to this traditional classroom learning experience there are also outdoor activities which allow students to put what they have learned into practice while enjoying themselves at the same time. For those who struggle with mental health issues like anxiety or depression – physical education can play an integral role in providing relief from symptoms due to its ability to facilitate improved mood states through increased endorphin production brought on by exercise routines designed specifically for individuals’ needs; these benefits extend beyond just feeling better but will also impact cognitive function positively affecting areas such as memory recall and reasoning skills which may help individuals reach their full academic potentials more easily when enough attention is paid towards one’s mental well-being alongside their academic goals in tandem. . . On top of all this beneficial insight gained during physical education classes–students transitioning back into “normalcy” after periods away from traditional schooling would benefit greatly upon returning especially if they had long breaks where excessive outside recreational activity was not possible as reintroducing oneself slowly back into movement-based activities has been proven time again not only improve overall positive feelings associated with being physically active but also facilitates healthier attitudes towards

One of the most important responsibilities of students is to give back to their community. By requiring students to perform community service, it will teach them to be compassionate and generous, while also becoming better citizens and members of society. Community service can help students foster relationships with members of their community, something they may not have done otherwise. It may even help them to become more empathetic people, develop leadership capabilities, and even boost their career achievements.

In addition, students can use community service to gain skills and important experience in areas of their interests. Engaging in community service allows students to explore possible career areas by getting a firsthand look at different jobs that they may not have been aware of otherwise. Lastly, requiring students to perform community service will also give them a sense of responsibility and ownership of their own lives. They will learn that their actions matter and have an impact beyond their individual lives.

For all these reasons, I urge you to consider making community service a required part of the curriculum. Not only will students benefit directly from performing community service, but our community as a whole will be enriched by their involvement. Thank you for your consideration.",1
"The internet has changed our lives in countless ways, making it easier than ever to stay connected with people all around the world. But perhaps one of the most overlooked advantages of being online is its ability to foster creativity and passion projects. One such example is cosplay – a form of performance art that involves dressing up as beloved characters from movies, books, video games and more. Cosplaying began in Japan during the 1980s when fans would imitate their favorite manga and anime heroes for conventions or special events. As technology progressed, so did cosplaying: what started out as limited costuming soon evolved into elaborate recreations complete with intricate props and accessories made by hand. The craft eventually spread worldwide thanks to social media platforms like Instagram, Tumblr and others; now there are entire communities dedicated to this hobby – each one filled with creative energy!. Cosplayers take pride in their work; they spend hours researching materials, techniques and reference pictures before even starting on a project. They will often collaborate with other enthusiasts to share ideas on how best to bring their character designs to life; some may even choose professional costume makers who specialize in creating authentic replicas for those willing (and able) to pay the price tag attached!. . For many cosplayers, this type of expression allows them an escape from everyday stressors while simultaneously providing an outlet through which they can express themselves artistically without fear of judgement or ridicule. Not only does this allow them a chance at self-actualization but it also encourages community building among like-minded individuals who might not otherwise have had an opportunity for connection due to geographical restrictions or physical limitations imposed by real life circumstances. . .

"There are many factors to consider when trying to determine if young people enjoy life more than older people. Age is just one of many variables that can affect a person's enjoyment of life. Other important factors include health, wealth, social status, and personal relationships.

That said, it is difficult to make a general statement about whether young people or older people enjoy life more. It is possible that young people enjoy life more because they are generally healthier and have more energy than older people. They may also have less responsibility and fewer worries. On the other hand, older people may enjoy life more because they have more wisdom and life experience. They may also have more financial stability and closer relationships.

It is also important to consider that different people enjoy different things. Some young people may not enjoy life as much as some older people because they have not yet had the opportunity to experience all that life has to offer. Similarly, some older people may not enjoy life as much as some young people because they have already experienced everything they want to in life.

In conclusion, it is hard to say definitively whether young people or older people enjoy life more. There are many factors that affect a person's enjoyment of life, and different people enjoy different things.

"While the notion of an ancient alien structure on Mars is intriguing, the evidence from scientific studies strongly supports that the “Face on Mars” is simply a result of natural geological patterns and processes. When initially observed from orbiting satellites, the rectangular shapes and symmetry of the landform did resemble a deliberately designed structure. However, upon closer examination by spacecraft and scientific analysis, it becomes clear that natural erosional forces created this unique landform over millions of years.

There are several key pieces of evidence that point to a natural origin for the Face. First, images from the Viking orbiters and landers revealed that the surrounding terrain displayed similar patterns of plateaus, mesas and cliffs eroded into puzzling shapes. This indicates it was part of a larger pattern of natural landforms shaped by wind and water erosion over eons. Scientists also observed no evidence of artificial construction methods or technologies that would be expected for an artificial construct of that scale. Additionally, images with higher resolution showed the “face” was actually an uneven and arbitrary pattern of hills and mesa ridges with no symmetrical proportions or evidence of design when viewed close up.  

Perhaps most convincingly, data from the Mars Global Surveyor mission in 1998 showed that the “face” was an example of a natural geological feature known as a “mesa”. Mesas are flat-topped hills or mountains formed by weathering and erosional processes that carve softer rock layers beneath harder caprock layers. The patterns in the rock that appeared rectilinear from a distance were revealed to be the natural undulations and slopes typical of such geological mesa formations. There is simply no anomalous or artificial materials or evidence of technology to be found upon close examination of the landform and surrounding terrain.

In conclusion, while the idea of encountering ancient aliens on Mars is an exciting prospect, scientific analysis has clearly shown the “Face on Mars” to be a product of natural geological forces, not artificial construction. The preponderance of evidence from multiple missions to study Mars upholds an origin of simple wind and water erosion over millions of years forming this celebrated but entirely natural mesa landform. For those seeking proof of past life or civilization on Mars, the answers will have to be found through more promising locations yet to be discovered and studied.",1
"The Effects of Technology on Education. Technology has brought about tremendous changes in the way people learn and interact with educational content. In modern times, technology is pervasive in all aspects of education, from K-12 instruction to college courses and beyond. Technology can have both positive and negative effects on education. The use of technology can lead to a more interactive learning environment, increased access to resources, improved communication between teachers and students, as well as enhanced productivity. However, it also has the potential to create an impersonal classroom experience and diminish the quality of student’s work due to distractions caused by devices such as smartphones or tablets. One major benefit that comes along with incorporating technology into classrooms is its ability to engage students more deeply in their studies through interactive activities instead of traditional lecture style teaching. Teachers are able to develop multimedia lessons which incorporate videos, audio files, animations etc., making lessons much more exciting for students than simply reading out loud from textbooks or notes written on chalkboards. Modern day tools such as online quizzes can provide real-time feedback which helps teachers measure comprehension levels among their students quickly without having them take time away from their studies for assessments like exams or tests; thus improving overall understanding among learners drastically at no extra cost!. . Another noteworthy advantage that comes along with using tech within classrooms is providing greater access for everyone involved in learning regardless of location or physical constraints which might otherwise prevent individuals from attending school/college regularly like disabilities or financial problems. Through distance learning programs made possible by online platforms/apps such as Blackboard Learn & Google Classroom – anyone who wishes so may now attend classes virtually while still obtaining full credit towards graduation requirements! This allows many disadvantaged kids around the world get access not just basic information but even rigorous college level courses if they wish too - something previously only available expensive institutions before technological advancements were made possible today!. . By embracing this new found convenience however one should be aware that there are certain drawbacks associated with over reliance

"While technology to discern emotional expressions could potentially provide insights, its use for monitoring students risks compromising privacy and autonomy. 

Any technology wields power that must be judiciously governed. FACS enables perceiving feelings beyond what words convey, yet emotions exist within a complex interior life that extends beyond facial signals. A student's expression indicates only one perspective among many internal and external factors shaping how they process a situation. 

Before using such a system, its insights must be evaluated against potential overreaches. Continual surveillance could undermine students' comfort to freely explore ideas without judgment on each reaction. It may also distort teaching by redirecting focus from academic content to policing expressions. 

Rather than constant monitoring, occasional application of FACS may prove useful - for example, anonymously capturing class trends to inform lesson plans. Used sparingly and voluntarily, it need not infringe on privacy or reduce students to expressions separate from their multi-dimensional experiences. But establishing trust and consent is vital here. 

Overall the technology's value depends on its degree of democratic oversight and service to learning goals. With care and restraint, it could offer supplemental perspective; but left unguided, continual emotional profiling risks doing more harm through its effects on psychological safety, autonomy and the student-teacher relationship. A balanced approach respecting student well-being should take priority over data collection itself.",1
"There are a variety of opinions on what universities are meant to do – some think they are solely meant to prepare students for employment, while others believe that they have other functions as well. I believe that universities do have a dual purpose – to prepare students for the workforce, and to provide them with a well-rounded education.

Employers increasingly want employees who have university degrees, so it is important for students to have a strong academic foundation. A university education can provide students with the skills and knowledge they need to be successful in the workforce. For example, a university degree can teach students how to think critically, how to solve problems, and how to work in a team.

However, a university education is about more than just preparing students for employment. It is also about giving students the opportunity to explore different subjects and to learn about different cultures. A university degree can open up new doors for students, and it can help them to achieve their goals and dreams.

In conclusion, I believe that universities have both a vocational and a non-vocational function. They provide students with the skills and knowledge they need to be successful in the workforce, but they also give students the opportunity to explore different subjects and to learn about different cultures. I think this is an important part of a university education, and it is something that should not be overlooked.

It is often argued that having broad knowledge of many historical periods and events will allow you to have a more nuanced understanding of complex historical contexts. In turn, this will allow you to make more informed and insightful arguments and perspectives.

Additionally, having a well-rounded knowledge of many academic disciplines can also be advantageous in the field of research. By having a better understanding of different research methodologies and tools, you will be better prepared to undertake original and innovative research projects.

Overall, it is generally argued that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is both beneficial and advantageous. While it is important to have a focus in one or two specific areas of study, it is also beneficial to have a more general understanding of many different areas of study.

"Televising government proceedings can certainly be beneficial to society by increasing public awareness of the issues and decisions that affect their lives. However, there are some issues that should be considered when deciding which proceedings should be televised. In this essay, I will discuss the potential benefits of televising government proceedings, as well as some of the potential drawbacks.

If done responsibly, and with the purpose of making the public more aware of the issues and decisions that directly affect their lives, televising government proceedings could have immense benefits. For example, people could gain a better understanding of the laws and policies being discussed in these proceedings, as well as a better understanding of the roles and responsibilities of their elected representatives. This could lead to an increase in civic engagement, and an increase in voter turnout at elections. Additionally, televising proceedings could increase transparency in government, as it would allow the public to easily see how their tax dollars are being used.

However, there are some drawbacks to televising government proceedings. For example, it could lead to a decrease in privacy for those involved in the proceedings. It could also lead to a decrease in the quality of debates and discussions, as many participants may be more concerned with how they appear on television, rather than with having a meaningful discussion. Additionally, some proceedings, such as trials, could be distorted by television coverage, as news organizations may sensationalize specific aspects of the case to make it more interesting for their viewers.

In conclusion, televising government proceedings could be beneficial to society, as it could increase public awareness of the issues and decisions that affect their lives. However, some issues should be considered before deciding which proceedings should be televised, as it could lead to a decrease in privacy and the quality of debates and discussions. Ultimately, if done responsibly and with the purpose of increasing public awareness, televising government proceedings could have many positive benefits.

Attending classes at a school has a variety of benefits that distance learning cannot quite match. First, students attending classes in a school have the opportunity to interact with their peers as they learn in a communal setting. This helps to both engage them more deeply in their lessons through discussion and also helps foster important social skills. Additionally, teachers are available in person to provide insight and aid in understanding concepts. 

Conversely, distance learning has its own set of advantages that can make it a worthwhile option. It allows greater flexibility in terms of scheduling, as students have the opportunity to structure their own learning environment and access materials when it works best for them. Distance learning also provides students with the opportunity to learn digital skills, as they can become comfortable with utilizing technology for their studies. Ultimately, both school and distance learning have valuable benefits and can be utilized to fit individual needs.",1
"As the education system has evolved over the years, the focus has shifted towards specializing in one field of study. Universities have provided students with numerous opportunities to become experts in their respective fields. However, a well-rounded education requires more than just mastering one area of study. It is essential for universities to require every student to take a variety of courses outside their field of study. The reason being that acquiring knowledge of various academic disciplines is the best way to become truly educated.

Firstly, taking courses outside of one's field of study broadens one's perspective. By being exposed to a variety of academic disciplines, students can learn to see the world from different angles. This exposure to diverse ideas and thoughts helps students to become more open-minded and accepting of others who may have different opinions or beliefs. Ultimately, this enables students to become better citizens of the world.

For instance, a student majoring in computer science may take a course in philosophy, which could provide them with a different perspective on technology and it's implications on society. Similarly, a student majoring in psychology could take a course in economics to learn about how financial incentives impact human behavior. Such courses can help students develop a holistic understanding of the world around them, which is essential for their personal growth and development.

Secondly, taking courses outside of one's field of study can improve critical thinking skills. When students are exposed to different academic disciplines, they are forced to think critically to understand and analyze the material. This skill is essential for success in any field, as it enables individuals to evaluate information and make informed decisions. Critical thinking skills are becoming increasingly important in today's society, where information is easily accessible, but not always reliable. Therefore, universities should provide students with ample opportunities to develop these skills.

For instance, a student majoring in literature may take a course in physics, which could require them to analyze complex scientific theories and concepts. This would not only improve their critical thinking skills, but also enable them to make connections between seemingly unrelated fields of study. Such skills could prove invaluable in their future careers or personal lives.

Finally, taking courses outside of one's field of study can help students discover new interests and passions. When students are exposed to a variety of academic disciplines, they may find that they are passionate about something they had never considered before. This could lead them to change their major or pursue a career in a field they never thought was possible. By taking courses outside of one's field of study, students can discover new opportunities that they may have otherwise missed.

For instance, a student majoring in engineering may take a course in anthropology, which could spark an interest in cultural studies. This may lead them to pursue a career in international development or become an advocate for cultural preservation. Such discoveries can be life-changing and fulfilling, and universities should provide students with the opportunity to make them.

In conclusion, universities should require every student to take a variety of courses outside their field of study. Exposure to diverse academic disciplines helps students to broaden their perspective, improve critical thinking skills, and discover new interests and passions. Such an education is essential for personal growth and development, and ultimately, for becoming a well-rounded and educated citizen of the world.

Having a positive attitude is often touted as the key to success. It may seem like a simple idea – having a positive outlook on life can help you achieve your goals and be successful. But the truth is that having a positive attitude has a much deeper significance and can lead to real success in many aspects of life. 

Studies have shown that those with a positive attitude tend to be more likely to take action towards achieving their goals, and this action is what leads to real success. For instance, a positive attitude can encourage an individual to put in more effort into succeeding in their career or education, because they believe that their goals are achievable. This can result in better career opportunities or higher grades. A positive attitude can also provide individuals with more self-confidence and belief in their abilities, which can spur them on to greater achievements. 

Furthermore, having a positive attitude can be beneficial to other areas of life too, such as relationships. By having an upbeat view on life, individuals can blaze paths to new friendships, find romance, or even strengthen existing connections. In this way, success is not just found in career terms, but also in personal connections.

In conclusion, having a positive attitude can lead to real success in more than just career terms. Positive thinking encourages individuals to take action towards their goals, and it strengthens their belief in their abilities and relationships. It is clear that having a positive attitude can open doors to greater achievements and a more fulfilled life.",1
"Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. I agree with this statement for a few reasons.

Firstly, if you only do what you already know how to do, you will never improve or learn new skills. In order to be successful, you need to constantly be learning and expanding your skill set. Trying new things is the only way to do this.

Secondly, if you only do what you already know how to do, you will quickly become bored and unmotivated. Doing new things and taking risks keeps things interesting and exciting. It also helps you to maintain a positive attitude, which is essential for success.

Lastly, taking risks is often necessary in order to achieve success. If you are not willing to take risks, you will never achieve anything great. Sometimes you need to take risks in order to reach your goals.

In conclusion, I believe that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. This is because doing new things is the only way to improve and learn new skills, and taking risks is often necessary in order to achieve success.

"There is no single answer to the question of whether young people nowadays give enough time to helping their communities. Some people might say that, given the opportunities available to them, today's young people are more engaged in helping their communities than ever before. Others might say that, despite the availability of opportunities, young people are not as engaged as they should be.

Both sides of the argument have valid points. On the one hand, there are countless examples of young people who have dedicated themselves to helping others. For example, there are many young people who work with charities or volunteer their time to help those in need. On the other hand, there are also many young people who seem to be more interested in their own lives and their own happiness than in helping others.

There are a number of reasons why young people might not be as engaged in helping their communities as they should be. One reason is that young people are often busy with their own lives. They may be working or going to school, and they may not have the time to volunteer or to participate in other activities that would help their communities. Another reason is that young people may not feel like they have the power to make a difference. They may not feel like they can do anything to solve the world's problems, and so they may not see the point in trying.

Despite these reasons, I believe that young people should be more engaged in helping their communities. One reason for this is that young people have a lot of energy and enthusiasm, which can be put to good use in helping others. Another reason is that young people are often more connected to technology than older people, and they can use this technology to help others. For example, they can use social media to spread awareness about important issues or to raise money for charity.

"The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a cutting-edge technology that enables computers to identify human emotions. As described in the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" this technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with computers and understand human emotions. However, the question remains whether the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.

On the one hand, using FACS in the classroom can provide teachers with valuable insights into their students' emotional states. This information can help teachers identify students who may be struggling or feeling overwhelmed, allowing them to provide additional support and guidance. It can also help teachers assess the effectiveness of their teaching methods and make adjustments to better engage their students. Moreover, FACS can help create a more positive and inclusive learning environment by enabling teachers to recognize and address any biases or discrimination that may be present in the classroom.

On the other hand, there are several concerns surrounding the use of FACS in the classroom. Firstly, there is the issue of privacy. Students may feel uncomfortable having their facial expressions monitored and analyzed by computers, and this could potentially create a sense of mistrust and discomfort in the classroom. Additionally, there is the risk of false positives or false negatives, where the technology misinterprets a student's emotional expression or fails to recognize it altogether. This could lead to misinformation and inappropriate interventions, which could ultimately harm the student.

Furthermore, relying too heavily on FACS could lead to a lack of human interaction and empathy in the classroom. Teachers are trained to recognize and respond to their students' emotions, and this technology could potentially replace that human connection. It is important for students to feel heard and understood by their teachers, and relying solely on technology to interpret their emotions could undermine this.

In conclusion, while the use of FACS in the classroom has the potential to be valuable, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks and limitations of this technology. It is crucial to strike a balance between the benefits of FACS and the need for human interaction and empathy in the classroom. By using FACS in a responsible and nuanced way, we can create a more positive and inclusive learning environment for all students.",1
"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Introduction:

Car usage has become an integral part of suburban life in many societies. However, there is a growing trend to limit car usage in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve the overall quality of life. This essay will explore the advantages of limiting car usage, as demonstrated in various examples from around the world. By adopting smart planning, promoting alternative transportation, and creating car-free spaces, societies can achieve a multitude of benefits, including reduced emissions, increased accessibility, and improved physical and mental well-being.

Body:

Paragraph 1:

Limiting car usage can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. For instance, in Vauban, Germany, an experimental car-free community, 70% of families do not own cars, and 57% of residents sold a car to move there. As a result, Vauban's residents experience reduced carbon emissions, with cars being responsible for only 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. This example highlights the potential impact of limiting car usage on reducing environmental harm.

Paragraph 2:

Beyond environmental advantages, limiting car usage can improve accessibility to services and amenities. Smart planning, which focuses on compact communities with accessible public transportation, makes daily tasks more convenient. Instead of relying on cars, stores are located within walking distance on main streets, reducing the need for long-distance travel. This approach has been adopted in many places, including suburbs in the United States. By making suburbs more compact and accessible, the dependency on cars decreases, improving the overall quality of life for residents.

Paragraph 3:

Additionally, limiting car usage can have a positive impact on physical and mental well-being. Car-free communities, such as Vauban, create environments conducive to walking, cycling, and other physical activities. These means of transportation not only contribute to a healthier lifestyle but also reduce air pollution and noise pollution. Studies have shown that increased physical activity and reduced exposure to pollutants have significant health benefits, resulting in lower rates of obesity, respiratory diseases, and stress-related disorders.

Paragraph 4:

The success of limiting car usage is not limited to specific regions. Examples from around the world demonstrate the potential for positive change. For instance, a car-free day was implemented in Bogota, Colombia, to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. The event introduced millions of Colombians to alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, and taking public buses. The overwhelming participation in the event highlights the willingness of people to embrace change and prioritize sustainability.

Conclusion:

Limiting car usage brings numerous advantages to individuals, communities, and the environment. By adopting smart planning, promoting alternative transportation, and creating car-free spaces, societies can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve accessibility, and enhance physical and mental well-being. The examples mentioned in this essay demonstrate the success and potential of limiting car usage, urging societies to reconsider their dependence on cars and embrace a more sustainable and healthier lifestyle. It is essential for citizens and policymakers to recognize the benefits of limiting car usage and work towards making our communities more sustainable and livable for future generations.",1

After high school, I was determined to pursue my ambition of becoming a professional dancer. But I quickly realized it wasn't going to be easy to break into that competitive field. There was a fierce competition and not everyone had the talent or the dedication to make it in the industry. So for me, it was a clear choice - hard work and determination was the only way forward.

I worked tirelessly with a single-minded focus, putting in 20-hour days and foregoing most luxuries in order to reach my goal. Even when I was feeling defeated and disheartened, I would look to the inspiring example of figures such as Oprah Winfrey and knew that if they could go from humble beginnings to global superstardom through hard work and perseverance, then so could I.

Although luck clearly does play a part in success, there is no substitute for hard work. Through hard work and dedication, I achieved my dream of becoming a professional dancer.

"Giving back to one's community is a common practice in many cultures. It is often seen as a way of paying homage to those who have helped to raise and support an individual. In some cases, it is also seen as a way of giving thanks for the opportunities and resources that the community has provided.

However, it'seems that young people nowadays are not as community-minded as previous generations. There are a number of reasons for this.

One reason is that young people are more focused on themselves than on others. With the advent of social media, young people are able to share their every thought and action with the world. This has led to a culture of self-promotion and self-absorption. Young people are more concerned with building their own personal brands than with giving back to their communities.

Another reason is that young people have less free time than previous generations. In the past, young people would have had more time to volunteer or get involved in community projects. However, nowadays young people are often bogged down by the demands of school and work. They don't have the time to give back to their communities in the way that they would like to.

Finally, young people are often not aware of the needs of their communities. In the past, communities were more close-knit and everyone was aware of the struggles of those around them. However, nowadays young people often live in their own little bubbles and are not as attuned to the needs of those around them.

Despite these reasons, there are still many young people who do give back to their communities. There are a number of organizations and programs that focus on giving young people the opportunity to help those in need. For example, the ""Youth Service America"" program connects young people with service opportunities in their communities.

In conclusion, while it is true that young people are not as community-minded as previous generations, there are still many young people who do care about giving back.

"When it comes to English learning, there is no doubt that electronic dictionaries (E-dictionaries) are a valuable tool. They can be a tremendous help when it comes to finding the right word, and they can save a lot of time.

However, there are some potential disadvantages to using E-dictionaries too much. For one, E-dictionaries can actually have a negative impact on our spelling skills. When we rely too much on E-dictionaries, we might start to misspell words because we don’t have to worry about making a mistake. This can actually be quite frustrating, and it can slow down our progress in the language.

Another potential downside to using E-dictionaries too much is that it can lead to a lack of fluency in the language. When we rely on E-dictionaries all the time, we may start to speak in a robotic fashion. This can make it difficult to communicate with native speakers, and it can even lead to difficulty mastering the grammar of the language.

Overall, it is important to use E-dictionaries in a way that is helpful, but not too helpful. Too much reliance on E-dictionaries can have negative consequences, while too little use can also lead to problems. It is important to find a balance that works best for you, and that is what will ultimately help you learn English better.

"I strongly agree that the general well-being of all it's people is the surest indicator of a great nation. While the achievements of rulers, artists, or scientists may impress the world, they alone cannot determine the greatness of a nation. The overall well-being of people, including their economic, social, and political conditions, is the most reliable measure of a country's greatness.

First and foremost, a country that cares about the well-being of it's people is more likely to create an environment that fosters growth and development. For instance, when a government prioritizes the provision of basic amenities such as healthcare, education, and housing, it creates a healthy population that is better equipped to contribute to national development. This investment in the people creates a sense of inclusivity, and citizens feel a sense of belonging to the country, which promotes patriotism and national unity.

Secondly, the general well-being of people is a reflection of a country's level of democracy and social justice. Countries that prioritize the well-being of their citizens have more equitable societies, where there is a fair distribution of resources and opportunities. In contrast, societies that neglect the well-being of their citizens often have high levels of inequality, corruption, and social unrest. This disparity creates a society where only a select few benefit from the country's resources, leaving the majority of the population struggling to make ends meet.

Lastly, a country's greatness is not determined only by it's economic status, but also by how it treats it's people. A country that has a robust economy but neglects the well-being of it's people cannot be considered great. The well-being of a country's people is paramount, and it'should be the guiding principle in national decision-making. A great nation is one that demonstrates compassion, empathy, and care for it's people.

In conclusion, I strongly agree that the general well-being of all it's people is the surest indicator of a great nation. A great nation is not simply defined by it's achievements but by it's ability to create an inclusive and equitable society that prioritizes the well-being of it's citizens. The general well-being of people is an essential indicator of a country's greatness and should be the guiding principle in national decision-making. It is the responsibility of governments to ensure that their citizens are healthy, educated, and have access to basic amenities. This investment in the people will lead to sustainable national growth and development.

When it comes to first impressions, it can be difficult to change them once they are made. We often make snap judgments of people and situations based on our initial instincts, especially if they present a negative view. That said, some have argued that it is indeed possible to change a negative first impression through sincere effort and dialogue. 

Proponents of this idea point to the value of communication and the power of trust. They suggest that by having honest conversations and demonstrating genuine care, a negative impression can be overturned. They claim that other factors such as body language and facial expressions can also help show someone that has been judged too harshly. 

On the other hand, some opponents argue that such an endeavor is ultimately fruitless, as our first instincts are difficult to shake. They claim that it is almost impossible to rewrite someone's opinion when a negative impression has been made. They argue that it is better to make a positive impression from the start in order to avoid any potential damage. 

Both sides of this argument offer valid points, and the reality is likely somewhere in the middle. While it is likely not easy to change a negative first impression, it is likely not impossible either. The importance of communication, trust, and demonstrating genuine care are key in any successful relationship, and it is possible to turn a negative first impression around if both parties are willing to be open and honest.",1

Extracurricular activities have been widely studied in relation to student educational outcomes and the opinions of parents. Research has shown that students who participate in organized extracurricular activities tend to demonstrate improved academic performance and greater interest in learning. At the same time, parents often become involved in their children's extracurricular activities, providing further support for academic achievement.

However, extracurricular activities can also have negative effects, particularly when students participate in too much activity. A lack of sleep, poor nutrition, and increased stress can all lead to burnout and decreased school performance. Over-scheduling students can also have detrimental effects on their physical and mental health. 

Finally, introducing incentive rules for extracurricular activities in a school system can have both positive and negative effects. On the positive side, incentives can help to increase participation in extracurricular activities and may help to further stimulate the academic performance of students. However, they can also encourage competition and competition-related stress in students, leading to lower self-esteem and decreased academic performance.",1
"The benefits of having a pet hamster are often overlooked, but they can be tremendous. From providing companionship to teaching children responsibility and caretaking skills, owning a hamster has its rewards. Primarily, having a pet hamster is an excellent way for people of all ages to learn about responsibility. They require regular feeding and cleaning, helping their owners develop important life skills from an early age. Hamsters also require daily exercise outside their cage - whether it's playing in a ball or running around on the floor - which encourages physical activity as well as mental stimulation for both the human and animal family members alike. This kind of routine helps kids establish consistency in other aspects of their lives such as homework or chores by creating positive habits that will last into adulthood. Furthermore, hamsters provide loveable companionship due to their affectionate nature; even if you just watch them play inside their habitat it can bring comfort during times when one feels alone. And because they're small rodents with short lifespans usually between 2-3 years old, caring for your hamster provides an opportunity to teach young ones empathy and understanding towards living creatures while imparting valuable lessons about mortality at the same time; although brief encounters with animals like these can be powerful reminders that life is precious regardless of how long it lasts – something we could all use more reminders of every now and then!. . . . All things considered there’s no question that pet ownership presents quite the unique challenge but with those challenges come some really amazing rewards too! Hamsters are great pets for anyone looking to add some new furry friends into their home without taking on too much extra work or worry

"Examining the role of technology in modern education is an important topic for many students, parents, and educators. Technology has quickly become a significant part of educational settings due to its capabilities to enhance learning experiences. In recent years, it has been utilized extensively in classrooms across the world—from primary schools all the way up through college campuses. However, questions remain as to how beneficial technology actually is when used in the classroom setting. In terms of positive outcomes from utilizing technology within an educational context, one can see that it offers numerous advantages that can help improve student performance and learning abilities over time. For starters, integrating tech-based tools opens up access to new resources such as online course materials or lectures that previously were unavailable unless physically present at a school or collegiate institution. Additionally, technological innovations provide opportunities for collaboration among both students and teachers alike; through interactive whiteboards which allow real-time feedback on assignments given by instructors or group projects taken on by peers who may be located miles away from one another but still able to connect virtually via conference call and presentation software applications like Google Hangouts Meetings. Moreover, there are also many personalized options available such as programs designed for special needs individuals with disabilities so they too may have equal opportunities for success alongside their peers without having any additional barriers based on physical limitations imposed upon them traditionally before digital innovation was introduced into academia's mainstream curriculum design practices today. On the other hand however some concerns have been raised about potential drawbacks associated with relying too heavily upon digital solutions throughout academic environments instead of sticking more closely with traditional means otherwise known prior to these advancements being made within information age industry developments decades ago (such as actual textbooks). Proponents suggest this kind of complete reliance could potentially lead towards various issues including overstimulation caused by constant media exposure resulting in attention deficits such cognitive fatigue & burnout if not monitored carefully enough; data privacy violations once personal information is shared online beyond secure firewalls set up protectively against cyber intrusion attempts

Subject: The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College system currently in place for electing the President of the United States. While some argue in favor of changing to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College should be retained due to its crucial role in maintaining a fair and balanced election process.

The Electoral College was established as a compromise between election by Congress and a popular vote. It consists of 538 electors, with a minimum requirement of 270 electoral votes to elect the President. Each state's allotment of electors is based on the number of representatives it has in Congress. This system ensures that every state, regardless of its size or population, has a say in the election and prevents larger states from dominating the process (Office of the Federal Register).

Contrary to popular belief, the Electoral College rarely results in the winner of the popular vote losing the presidency. In fact, since 1888, this has only occurred once in the 2000 election (Posner, Judge Richard A). This demonstrates that the current system maintains the principle of majority rule while also providing a stable and reliable outcome. Additionally, the Electoral College has been successful in avoiding scenarios where no candidate receives a majority of the votes, thereby preventing the need for costly and time-consuming runoff elections (Posner, Judge Richard A).

Furthermore, the Electoral College promotes the representation of all regions of the country by requiring presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. Without this requirement, candidates could focus solely on regions where they have the most support, neglecting the interests and voices of other regions (Posner, Judge Richard A). This ensures that the President represents the diverse needs and concerns of the entire nation and not just specific regions.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is the emphasis it places on swing states. Under this system, candidates are incentivized to campaign in states that can swing the outcome of the election, leading to increased voter engagement and attention in these states (Posner, Judge Richard A). This means that swing state voters have a more significant influence on the election, encouraging candidates to address their concerns and issues. Without the Electoral College, candidates would focus only on densely populated areas, leaving the majority of states with little to no attention during the campaign.

Lastly, the Electoral College provides smaller states with a fair share of attention during presidential campaigns. By awarding electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even small states can play a crucial role in the final outcome of the election (Posner, Judge Richard A). It ensures that candidates cannot solely rely on winning the popular vote in large states to secure victory, giving smaller states a voice and influence in the electoral process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a vital component of our democratic system and should be retained. It maintains the principles of representation, regional balance, and majority rule while preventing scenarios of no majority and ensuring all states have an equal say. Changing to a popular vote system would ignore these advantages and potentially lead to unintentional consequences that could compromise the integrity of our presidential elections.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I urge you to consider the importance of the Electoral College and the reasons why it should be preserved for future presidential elections. I trust that you will make the right decision in the best interest of our state and our nation.

Sincerely,

As evidenced by the essay, there are several advantages to children not performing community service. First, it can be an overwhelming and emotionally draining experience, especially for younger children. At such a young age, kids may not yet have the emotional maturity needed to process difficult interactions with members of the community. Also, community service projects require the completion of a certain degree of physical labor or participation in other activities for which younger children may not be ready. Additionally, since these activities are often outdoors, the physical exertion can be extremely taxing on growing bodies. Finally, children should be allowed the time and freedom to enjoy their childhoods and focus on developing skills that are important to their personal growth and development.",1
"When it comes to traveling, many people believe that the best way to do so is in a group led by a tour guide. There are many reasons why this is the case. First of all, a tour guide can provide a wealth of information about the destination that the group is visiting. This information can be useful in making the most of the trip, and can help to avoid any surprises. Additionally, a tour guide can be a great source of support during the trip. If something goes wrong, a tour guide can help to get everyone back on track. Finally, a tour guide can be a great source of entertainment. By taking the group on interesting and fun trips, tour guides can make the trip more enjoyable for everyone.

All of these reasons make it clear why a tour guide is a valuable member of a group traveling to a new destination. If you are considering traveling to a new destination, it is definitely worth considering taking a tour with a guide.

The second way science experiments are enjoyable is by offering an opportunity to explore the creative aspects of science. Experimenting allows people to use their imagination and explore innovative solutions to scientific problems. Experimenting also fosters creativity because it encourages people to come up with innovative solutions to the challenges they face. For example, when exploring the properties of a new material, one might experiment with different combinations of components to discover the properties that most effectively make it useful. 

The third way science experiments are enjoyable is by providing an entertaining and stimulating experience. Conducting experiments can be fun, exciting, and exhilarating as people work to discover something new. Experimenting also brings a sense of accomplishment and pride as one has successfully demonstrated their findings and come to a conclusion. Experiments are also a great way to engage with others, as many people enjoy sharing their results and discussing their findings with each other. For example, a family might have fun setting up different experiments and then compare their results.

In conclusion, there are numerous ways in which science experiments can be enjoyable. From learning interactively to exploring the creative aspects of science to having fun and easily engaging with others, experiments offer a great opportunity to explore the mysterious world around us. They can ignite someone’s curiosity and love of science and make learning enjoyable.",1

Subject: The Electoral College vs Popular Vote for Presidential Election

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for the retention of the Electoral College in the process of electing the President of the United States, despite the arguments made in favor of changing to a popular vote system. While I acknowledge the concerns raised by proponents of a popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College is a vital component of our democracy for several reasons.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome in the presidential election. As stated by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College almost always exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that the electoral system produces a clear winner, reducing the likelihood of disputes and ensuring a smooth transition of power. In contrast, a popular vote system would be more prone to controversy and potential challenges to the outcome.

Secondly, the Electoral College is designed to ensure that the President represents all regions of the country, not just the most populous areas. The requirement for a candidate to have trans-regional appeal promotes inclusivity and prevents the domination of one region over others. This is essential for fostering a sense of unity and ensuring that all citizens feel that their voices are heard in the election process.

Thirdly, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on a broader range of states, particularly swing states. This results in candidates addressing the concerns and issues that are specific to those states, engaging with the voters, and providing targeted policy solutions. In contrast, a popular vote system would incentivize candidates to focus solely on highly populous areas, potentially neglecting the needs of less populated regions. The Electoral College ensures that candidates must consider the interests of all states, creating a more balanced and representative democracy.

Fourthly, the Electoral College restores balance to the political system by giving weight to the larger states, which would otherwise be underrepresented due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. As Judge Richard A. Posner explains, the Electoral College provides more attention to larger states during the campaign, as winning a close vote in a large state leads to a substantial number of electoral votes. This ensures that the concerns of citizens in these states are given due consideration and prevents them from being marginalized in the election process.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections, which can complicate the process and create additional challenges. It ensures that a clear winner emerges, even if no candidate secures a majority of the popular vote. This allows for a smooth and efficient election process, providing stability and avoiding prolonged political uncertainty.

In conclusion, while there are valid arguments in favor of changing to a popular vote for the presidential election, the Electoral College has proven to be an effective and important part of our democratic system. It ensures certainty of outcome, promotes inclusivity, encourages candidates to engage with all states, provides balance to the political system, and avoids run-off elections. Retaining the Electoral College is essential to maintaining the integrity and fairness of our presidential elections.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter. I trust that you will carefully weigh the arguments before making any decisions regarding this important issue.

Sincerely,

"Limiting car usage can bring several advantages to both individuals and communities. As highlighted by the passage set, reducing car dependency can contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and promote a healthier and more sustainable lifestyle.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passage, passenger cars account for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and even up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, the overall carbon footprint can be effectively reduced, contributing to the effort in combating climate change and improving the environment.

Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to improved air quality. The passage on Paris's driving ban highlights how congestion was reduced by 60 percent during the ban, resulting in a decrease in smog levels comparable to some of the most polluted cities in the world. The reduction in car emissions, particularly from diesel vehicles, can have a positive impact on air quality and reduce respiratory health issues in communities.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can promote a healthier and more sustainable lifestyle. The passage on Bogota's car-free day demonstrates how alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, and public transit, can be promoted through initiatives like car-free days. Encouraging these modes of transportation not only reduces pollution but also encourages physical activity and improves public health. Moreover, designing communities with fewer cars in mind, as seen in Vauban, Germany, can create more accessible and walkable neighborhoods, with stores and services within walking distance. This reduces the need for unnecessary car trips and promotes a sense of community.

While some may argue that limiting car usage may inconvenience individuals, it is important to recognize the long-term benefits it brings to society as a whole. The passage suggests that there is a cultural shift happening, particularly among younger generations, where car ownership and driving are becoming less important. This shift aligns with efforts to reduce carbon emissions and create more sustainable and livable communities. By adopting smart planning and promoting alternative modes of transportation, the advantages of limiting car usage can be realized for the benefit of both individuals and the environment.",1

Dear Senator [Senator's Surname],

I am writing to express my views on an important issue that impacts our nation's presidential elections: the Electoral College. I believe that the Electoral College should be kept, rather than changing to a system of election by popular vote. Although some argue that the Electoral College is outdated and undemocratic, I maintain that it plays a crucial role in our political system for several reasons.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome in elections. As we have witnessed in the past, disputes over the popular vote are not uncommon. However, due to the winner-take-all nature of the Electoral College, the winning candidate's share of electoral votes typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. This structure reduces the likelihood of disputes and provides a clear and decisive result, making it more likely that the will of the people is accurately represented.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes the concept of ""everyone's president."" Under this system, candidates must have trans-regional appeal and cannot solely focus on winning states with a majority of electoral votes. This ensures that presidential candidates must campaign across different regions, listening to diverse perspectives and addressing the concerns of citizens nationwide. By encouraging candidates to appeal to a wider range of voters, the Electoral College fosters a sense of inclusivity and representation for all Americans.

Another benefit of the Electoral College is its emphasis on swing states. Consequently, candidates focus their campaign efforts on these states, which can lead to more informed and engaged voters. Swing states receive more attention, leading to increased political discourse, and allowing for a more thoughtful and informed electorate. This system ultimately encourages candidates to listen to and address the concerns of citizens in these states, fostering a stronger connection between elected officials and the people they represent.

Additionally, the Electoral College helps balance out the influence of big states. The system ensures that large states do not have an overwhelming advantage over smaller states in the election process. The distribution of electoral votes provides a fairer representation of the population, allowing candidates to seek support from a broader range of states. Consequently, this balances power between states and prevents candidates from being solely focused on the interests of densely populated areas.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate secures a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College guarantees a clear winner. By avoiding run-off elections, which could complicate the presidential election process, the Electoral College maintains efficiency and stability in our electoral system.

While some argue that the Electoral College disenfranchises voters in non-competitive states, studies have shown that voters still participate in elections even if their state is likely to favor one candidate over another. Additionally, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in a variety of states and listen to the concerns of citizens across the country.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a critical component of our democratic system. It ensures certainty, promotes inclusivity, encourages candidate engagement in swing states, balances the influence of big states, and reduces the need for run-off elections. While some proposed alternatives may offer changes to the system, they fail to address the core benefits and historical significance of the Electoral College. I urge you to consider these points when deliberating on this matter.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I trust that you will represent the interests of your constituents while making decisions regarding our electoral process.

Sincerely,

"There is no doubt that work has become more stressful and less leisurely in recent years. There are a number of reasons for this, but one of the most significant is the increase in work hours. In the past, people could take a few days off per week to relax and enjoy themselves. Now, many people work all day and sometimes into the night, which has a negative impact on both their mental and physical health. Additionally, the work schedule has changed so that people are often working for long periods of time without any time off. This can lead to a lack of rest and a lack of opportunity to relax. Finally, the work environment has become more competitive and competitive salaries have made it difficult to achieve a good work-life balance.

"Technology has come a long way in the last century. From the days of having to use a typewriter to the days of having an iPhone, life has become a lot more convenient. For example, if you wanted to write a letter, you would have to use a typewriter. With an iPhone, you can easily type a letter on the keyboard and send it electronically.

Some people may say that life was better when technology was simpler, because you had to be more careful with your belongings and you couldn’t easily share information with others. Other people may say that life is better now because we have all kinds of gadgets and we can communicate with people anywhere in the world.

It is hard to say which is better, because both sides have their benefits. For example, with simpler technology, you would have to be more careful with your belongings, which could protect them from theft. On the other hand, with more technology, you can easily communicate with people around the world.

Overall, I think that life is better now because we have more technology. We can easily communicate with each other and share information.

"  The Path to Sustainable Urban Development  In a world marked by relentless urbanization and growing environmental concerns, the concept of car-free cities has emerged as a pioneering approach to address the multifaceted challenges of modern urban living. These cities propose a fundamental shift in urban planning, where private automobiles are either heavily restricted or entirely absent, making space for sustainable transportation alternatives and a greener, more vibrant urban environment.  Car-free cities represent a visionary perspective on urban living, focusing on sustainability, public health, and community well-being. They offer a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment, though this transition is not without its unique set of challenges.  One of the central benefits of car-free cities is their potential to significantly reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. By prioritizing pedestrian and cyclist safety, these cities aim to reduce accidents and improve public health, contributing to better respiratory and cardiovascular well-being for urban residents. Moreover, car-free cities make efficient use of urban space, converting parking lots and wide roads into green parks, recreational areas, and pedestrian zones. This transformation rejuvenates the urban landscape, enhancing the overall quality of life for city residents. Reduced reliance on private cars results in decreased traffic congestion, shorter commute times, and reduced stress levels for urban inhabitants. Additionally, car ownership can be a significant financial burden, and by relying less on private vehicles, residents have the opportunity to save money on car-related expenses, improving their financial stability.  However, transitioning to car-free cities is not without its unique set of challenges. Many individuals heavily rely on their cars for daily activities and commutes, which can result in resistance to the transition due to concerns about inconvenience and a perceived loss of personal freedom. Effective public transportation is essential for the success of car-free cities, and substantial investments are required to expand and enhance public transit systems, providing convenient alternatives to private cars. Businesses that depend on car-dependent customers may experience declining revenues during the transition, necessitating solutions to mitigate the economic impact. The process of reconfiguring urban areas for car-free living is complex and time-consuming, requiring comprehensive planning and substantial investments in infrastructure.  To successfully implement car-free cities, solutions include expanding and improving public transportation, promoting active transportation methods such as walking and cycling, encouraging carpooling and ride-sharing, adopting electric and sustainable transportation options, and focusing on public education and awareness.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer a visionary perspective on more sustainable, healthier, and community-centric urban living. Despite the challenges, the potential benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, public health, efficient urban living, and cost savings make them a compelling goal. By investing in public transportation, promoting alternative transportation methods, and engaging the public in the planning process, cities can work toward a future where private cars are no longer the dominant mode of transportation. Car-free cities represent a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment.",1

Attending classes from home online or by video conference has many potential benefits. For example, it eliminates the need for students to physically attend a class on campus, saving time and money associated with traveling and living on campus. It also gives students more flexibility, as lectures and course materials can be accessed and reviewed at any time, rather than conforming to the constraints imposed by physical class schedules. 

However, online or video conference classes come with some limitations. For one, it can be more difficult to stay engaged and attentive when classes are held in a non-traditional environment. Additionally, students may find it more difficult to connect and collaborate with peers, as there is no face-to-face interaction.

Overall, I believe that classes from home online or by video conference should be available for all students. Even though there are some minor drawbacks, the convenience of being able to access classes on their own schedule and in their own space makes this an ideal option for students who want to take advantage of the latest educational opportunities.",1

Humans have a natural desire to ""fit in"" in society but often this can come at a price. One of the most common ways in which people attempt to fit in is by imitating others, especially those we admire and aspire to be like. While this can be seen as an advantage – allowing us to pick up positive qualities from role models who are already successful – it can also have drawbacks. For example, by trying to fit in and act a certain way, we can become afraid of making mistakes; we become so fixated with blending in that we can unwittingly compromise our own character and originality. 

At the same time, it is important to recognize that often our character is formed by several influences beyond our control. From the people we look up to, to our upbringing and environment, we are unavoidably shaped by outside forces. However, while we cannot control what external influences there are, we can decide how we react to them and determine the level to which they will shape our character.",1
"Support for the Electoral College or Transition to Popular Vote

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my views regarding the Electoral College and whether it should be retained or changed to an election by popular vote for the President of the United States. As an informed citizen and constituent, I have carefully considered the information from various sources, including the texts provided, and I believe that the Electoral College should be maintained for several reasons.

First and foremost, the Electoral College system ensures certainty of outcome. In the current system, the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote always exceeds their share of the popular vote. This reduces the chances of disputes over the election outcome, as demonstrated by the 2012 election, where President Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and his opponent. Furthermore, with almost all states using a winner-take-all system, even a slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory.

Another crucial advantage of the Electoral College is that it promotes a president who has trans-regional appeal. No single region in the country has enough electoral votes to elect a president, forcing candidates to appeal to a broad range of voters across different regions. This system ensures that the president represents the interests of various regions and prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from being elected. It also engenders the sentiment that the president is everyone's president, fostering a sense of national unity.

Moreover, the Electoral College incentivizes candidates to campaign in swing states. By awarding electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, candidates focus their efforts on these states, which can translate into increased voter engagement and thoughtful decision-making. Swing states, therefore, play a crucial role in determining the election outcome, as voters in these states receive the most attention and information from the candidates.

Additionally, the Electoral College balances the weight of political influence between large and small states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, as prescribed in the Constitution, disadvantages large states in terms of their representation. However, the Electoral College partially rectifies this discrepancy by rewarding larger states with more attention from presidential candidates. This way, candidates are encouraged to address the concerns and issues facing both large and small states.

Lastly, the Electoral College system provides an effective means of avoiding run-off elections. It ensures that a clear winner is always declared, preventing the need for additional elections in cases where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This feature streamlines the presidential election process and reduces complexity and potential complications.

While advocates for a direct popular vote argue that the Electoral College is undemocratic, the information provided in the texts demonstrates that the system has practical benefits and aligns with key democratic principles. The Electoral College ensures certainty, promotes trans-regional appeal, encourages meaningful voter participation, balances political influence, and avoids run-off elections.

In conclusion, I strongly support maintaining the Electoral College as the method for electing the President of the United States. It serves as a vital mechanism for ensuring fair and representative elections. I kindly request that you consider these perspectives when determining your position on this matter. Thank you for your time and attention to this important issue.

Sincerely,

"There are many reasons to believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. One reason is that it is easier to find a job if you are broadly educated. A second reason is that it is easier to think critically and come up with new ideas if you are broadly educated. A third reason is that it is easier to learn new things if you are broadly educated.

One reason to believe that it is better to be broadly educated is that it is easier to find a job. A recent study by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce found that “specialists are in high demand, but their skills are narrowly tailored. They are more likely to be unemployed or underemployed than those with a broader range of skills.” In other words, if you are broadly educated, you will be more likely to find a job than if you specialize in one specific subject.

A second reason to believe that it is better to be broadly educated is that it is easier to think critically and come up with new ideas. A study by the University of Warwick found that “broadly educated people are more likely to be creative and come up with new ideas.” In other words, if you are broadly educated, you will be more likely to come up with new ideas than if you specialize in one specific subject.

A third reason to believe that it is better to be broadly educated is that it is easier to learn new things. A study by the University of Edinburgh found that “broadly educated people are better at learning new things.” In other words, if you are broadly educated, you will be better at learning new things than if you specialize in one specific subject.

"An essay about the changing face of the restaurant industry in 2020. With businesses worldwide feeling the strain due to Covid-19, it's no surprise that the restaurant industry has been particularly hard hit. For decades, restaurants have formed a defining part of life in cities and towns around the globe; they provide employment for millions of people, contribute huge amounts of tax revenue to local economies, and bring together friends and families for countless meals every day. Unfortunately, this sector has faced massive upheaval over recent months as governments strive to contain coronavirus outbreaks – leaving many thousands without work and with an uncertain future ahead. However some are looking at ways that can help keep their establishments afloat during this difficult period. Changes made by restaurateurs include switching from sit-down service to takeout orders only, or offering delivery services which were once overlooked or underutilized by certain types of eateries. This shift towards convenience and contactless ordering is becoming increasingly important for customers who may be uncomfortable dining out due to health concerns – not just because it provides greater safety but also because it allows them to still enjoy delicious dishes from their favorite places in their own homes instead. Furthermore there's been an increase in online activities such as virtual chef demonstrations on social media platforms like Instagram or YouTube where cooks offer cooking tips while demonstrating how various recipes can be recreated at home using ingredients available from local supermarkets or grocers nearby; loyalty programs are also being used more frequently so loyal patrons are rewarded with discounts when they order food through takeaway apps; plus some business owners have decided to get onboard with “ghost kitchens” – essentially shared commercial kitchen spaces where multiple restaurants serve up different cuisines all cooked within one location (and often delivered directly). All these strategies allow restauranteurs maintain a regular income stream despite having fewer customers coming through the door physically right now - some of whom may never return even if given the chance!. It is clear that times are

"Over the past few decades, there has been a growing trend in many parts of the world to limit car usage in suburban areas. This movement, called ""smart planning,"" aims to separate suburban life from auto use in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create more sustainable communities. Several examples from different countries illustrate the advantages of limiting car usage.

In Vauban, Germany, car ownership is allowed, but street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden. Instead, there are only two large garages at the edge of the development where car owners can buy a space. As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars and 57 percent sold a car to move there. The residents of Vauban have reported feeling happier and less stressed without cars. By limiting car usage, Vauban has created a more peaceful and environmentally friendly community.

Similarly, in Bogota, Colombia, a car-free day was implemented to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work on this day, leaving the streets empty of traffic jams. The event has been successful, drawing enthusiasm from municipal authorities from other countries who see it as a revolutionary change. The car-free day is part of a larger improvement campaign in Bogota that has led to the construction of bike paths, the creation of parks and sports centers, and the decrease of rush-hour traffic.

Paris, France, also implemented a partial driving ban due to intense smog. Motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or face a fine. The ban led to a 60 percent reduction in congestion in the city. Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, but exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. This temporary ban highlights the impact of car usage on air pollution and the need for alternative transportation solutions.

Limiting car usage has multiple advantages. One of the main benefits is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars are responsible for a significant percentage of these emissions, and by limiting car usage, communities can make a significant impact on their carbon footprint. Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to less congested streets and reduced air pollution. Car-free communities, like Vauban, encourage walking, biking, and public transportation, which are healthier and more sustainable modes of transportation.

There is evidence that the trend of limiting car usage is already happening in the United States. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. This decrease in driving has occurred even before the recession, indicating a more fundamental shift in American behavior. The decrease in driving has positive implications for carbon emissions and the environment, although it may have negative implications for the car industry.

Overall, limiting car usage has several advantages, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, reduced congestion, improved air quality, and the promotion of alternative and sustainable transportation options. The examples from Vauban, Bogota, Paris, and the changing behavior in the United States demonstrate the viability and benefits of this approach. It is clear that limiting car usage is a crucial step in creating more sustainable and livable communities.",1
"Nowadays, many people believe that work is more stressful and less leisurely than in the past. While it is true that work can be stressful, I do not believe that it is any less leisurely. In fact, there are many reasons why work today can actually be more leisurely than in the past.

To begin with, technology has made it easier for people to work from home. This means that they can take work with them wherever they go, and they can work at their own pace. Additionally, many companies now offer flexible hours, which means that employees can work when they are most productive. This flexibility allows people to balance their work and personal lives more easily.

Another reason why work today can be more leisurely than in the past is because there is less pressure to work long hours. In the past, people often had to work long hours in order to make a good salary. However, today there are many jobs that offer a good salary without requiring employees to work long hours. This means that people can work a reasonable number of hours and still have a good quality of life.

Finally, I believe that work today can be more leisurely than in the past because people are more likely to take vacation days. In the past, people often felt guilty taking vacation days, because they felt that they were not working hard enough. However, today people are more likely to take vacation days, because they realize that it is important to take time for themselves. This means that people are more likely to enjoy their work, and they are less likely to feel stressed out.

In conclusion, while work can be stressful, I believe that it can also be more leisurely than in the past. This is because of the many technological advances that have made it easier for people to work from home, and because companies are offering more flexible hours. Additionally, people are more likely to take vacation days, which allows them to relax and enjoy their work.

"Studying Venus Remains a Worthy Pursuit

The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" makes a compelling case that studying Venus is worthwhile, even in the face of significant dangers. While conditions on Venus are extremely challenging for researchers and spacecraft, the potential scientific payoffs justify continued investigation of our neighboring planet. 

Several key points from the article bolster the author's proposition. First, Venus remains one of the least understood planets in our solar system. Its intense climate and atmospheric composition present mysteries that could reshape our understanding of planetary evolution. Researching Venus may even yield insights applicable to studying the atmospheres of exoplanets. 

Second, new technologies have emerged that could enable safer visits to Venus. For example, probes encased in reinforced shells could withstand the heat and pressure longer without failing. Airships floating high in the atmosphere may also access Venus with reduced risk compared to landers. These technological advances increase the feasibility of missions that stood little chance just decades ago. 

Finally, mysteries like whether Venus ever hosted oceans or what caused its atmospheric changes over time are uniquely answerable through in-situ observation and analysis. Remote sensing can only go so far - at some point, direct investigation is required to fully comprehend another world. Venus continues calling scientists to push the boundaries of what is possible in planetary exploration, which has historically advanced science and engineering in innovative new ways.

In sum, the author presents sound reasoning for why exploring Venus holds value despite the difficulties. With new tools and understanding, humanity can responsibly learn from even the most uninviting of neighbors. For all these persuasive arguments, continued study of Venus remains intellectually justified and practically achievable. The scientific opportunities clearly outweigh the hazards in making this inhospitable planet a priority for solar system research.",1
"Education is a vital aspect of our lives that shapes our personality, behavior, and future. Some people believe that education is a life-long process, while others think that it ends once we complete our formal education. In my opinion, education is an ongoing process that continues throughout our lives. I strongly believe that learning should never stop, and we should always strive to acquire new knowledge and skills.

Firstly, education is not limited to academic learning. It includes learning from our experiences, mistakes, and interactions with others. We learn new things every day, whether it's a new recipe, a new skill, or a new language. For instance, I learned how to cook from my mother, and I continue to learn new recipes from cookbooks and online tutorials. Similarly, I learned how to play the guitar from a friend, and I continue to improve my skills by practicing regularly. These are examples of informal education that we acquire throughout our lives.

Secondly, the world is constantly evolving, and new technologies, ideas, and concepts are emerging every day. To keep up with these changes, we need to continue learning and adapting. For instance, if we work in the field of technology, we need to keep ourselves updated with the latest trends and developments. Similarly, if we want to pursue a new career or hobby, we need to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills through education and training.

Finally, education is not just about personal growth; it also has a significant impact on society. A well-educated society is more prosperous, innovative, and progressive. Education helps us understand and appreciate different cultures, values, and perspectives, which promotes tolerance, diversity, and harmony. Moreover, education empowers individuals to make informed decisions, participate in civic activities, and contribute to the development of their communities.

In conclusion, education is a life-long process that should never stop. It is not limited to formal education but includes informal learning, personal growth, and societal development. Learning new things and acquiring new skills is essential for personal and professional growth, and it also contributes to the betterment of society. Therefore, we should all strive to be lifelong learners and embrace education as a continuous journey.

"Gardening has become increasingly popular over the last few years. It is a great way to spend time outdoors, get some exercise, and provide fresh fruits and vegetables for your family. As an avid gardener myself, I can attest to its many benefits. Gardening helps improve physical fitness by providing exercise that targets key muscle groups such as the arms and legs when weeding or digging holes for planting seeds. It also helps with mental fitness due to being able to relax in nature while tending our plants and flowers. In addition, gardening gives us access to fresh produce that is free of chemical fertilizers and pesticides used in conventional farming practices; it provides us with tasty treats like homegrown tomatoes or bell peppers without having to buy them at a grocery store marked up prices!. There are several things you need if you want have a successful garden: tools such as spades, hoes, rakes etc., soil amendments (like compost) for better drainage/water retention, fertilizer for healthy growth & protection from pests/diseases, pots or planters depending on what type of vegetation you’re growing (plants vs herbs), water source either through rainfall collection or irrigation systems…etc. A good starting point would be determining which type of plants work best for your space – annuals require more maintenance than perennials but yield larger rewards each season; veggies will not only give delicious meals but can often offer multiple harvests throughout the year if planted correctly too! Additionally knowing how much sunlight your area receives during different times throughout day should be taken into account before planning out beds & rows; some vegetables prefer partial shade while others thrive under direct sun exposure all day long – research prior purchase!. For those looking start their own backyard garden there are plenty resources available online via blogs & websites full helpful tips advice from experienced green thumbs alike; just remember take it one step at time don’t rush process enjoy journey along way make mistakes learn them use success stories

Many great inventors, such as Henry Ford and Thomas Edison, have attributed their success to hard work and persistence. They believed that if you work on something every day, eventually you will succeed. Their lives have provided us with numerous examples of how constant work and effort can help you reach your goals. Similarly, many companies have achieved success by continuously striving to improve their products, services, and processes. 

Furthermore, staying still and inactive can sometimes be beneficial as well. It can give you time to reflect on your work, consider ideas, and devise a plan of action. Inactivity allows you to be creative and thoughtful when it comes to your work. 

These examples demonstrate how important hard work and practice are when it comes to achieving success. Research shows that the more effort you put into something, the more likely you are to experience positive results. This supports the popular saying, “Practice makes perfect.”",1

With the advent of social media platforms such as YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook; people have become more informed than ever before about current events affecting their daily lives. This is especially true when it comes to the issue of climate change. Climate change has been one of the most talked-about topics in recent years due to its far-reaching impacts on human life globally. Climate change is caused by an increase in global temperatures that result from greenhouse gas emissions produced primarily through burning fossil fuels for energy consumption and industrial activities. The consequences range from warmer oceans leading to destructive weather patterns such as hurricanes and rising sea levels that can threaten coastal cities; changes in ecosystems with potential implications for global food security; increased water scarcity endangering communities’ access to clean drinking water; extreme heat waves posing health risks particularly among vulnerable populations like children, pregnant women, elderly people or those suffering from pre-existing conditions; air pollution raising public health concerns as well as having a detrimental effect on our environment. In combination these effects create real challenges that need immediate action from governments around the world if we want avoid further catastrophic damage or even economic collapse brought about by this crisis. . Fortunately there has been progress made towards mitigating our carbon footprint and reducing emissions worldwide but much more needs to be done if we are going take meaningful steps towards addressing this challenge head on. There must be an international effort involving both developed countries who contribute significantly regarding historical responsibility for environmental degradation with developing nations needing help transitioning away from reliance upon fossil fuels efficiently so they too can enjoy some kind of economic growth without sacrificing sustainability objectives or depleting natural resources at faster rates than necessary which would only exacerbate existing issues associated with climate change dynamics over time additionally exacerbating existing problems related to poverty reduction goals while simultaneously creating new ones altogether when considered within context local prevailing circumstances residents face trying make sense decision making processes involved stakeholder engagement structures since ultimate goal here should

Distance education is, without a doubt, a great opportunity for students who are looking for an alternative to traditional learning. It is an innovative and growing form of education that can provide several benefits over traditional learning. There are many reasons why distance learning can be a good option rather than a bad one. 

For students who are being bullied at school, distance learning can provide a sense of security and peace of mind. It allows them to learn in a safe environment and enables them to have more control over their personal schedule, so they can study on their own time without fear of harassment. 

Additionally, distance learning can be immensely advantageous for students who for whatever reason live too far away from their school to attend regularly. It gives students the flexibility to work from anywhere and complete their course work on their own time. 

Moreover, students should consider trying distance learning as it may offer them an opportunity to pursue their educational aspirations and goals with cost efficiency. Although there are costs associated with distance learning, when comparing to the cost of attending a traditional institution, it may be less expensive in the long run. 

In conclusion, distance learning can be a great option for students who are looking for an alternative and cost-effective way to pursue their educational goals. It can provide safety and flexibility to those who are being bullied and those who have limited access to a brick and mortar school. With the variety of benefits distance learning offers, it's worth considering as a viable option.",1
"School uniforms have been a staple in public school systems for centuries. They are intended to create an atmosphere of unity and equality among students, yet over time the use of school uniforms has become controversial. Supporters cite the positive effects that wearing a uniform can have on student behavior and academic performance, while opponents believe it restricts freedom of expression and enforces conformity. Proponents argue that when all students wear identical clothing, there is less competition amongst peers over fashion trends; this allows them to focus more on their education rather than trying to keep up with the latest styles. Additionally, those who support school uniforms often say that it prevents bullying or teasing due to dress code differences by eliminating outward displays of wealth or privilege. Finally, research suggests that simply having a uniform policy can improve student attendance rates due to fewer distractions from what other people are wearing each day. Though some may view uniforms as restrictive, others find them empowering as they provide comfort in feeling like part of a group and not having certain groups singled out based on their clothing choices. Furthermore, enforcing strict rules about attire can help instill discipline which carries into other aspects of life outside the classroom setting such as being mindful about how you present yourself at work or social events later in adulthood. Opponents claim that wearing school uniforms strips away individuality and self-expression since most schools mandate rigid guidelines regarding style and color scheme; this stifles creativity which should be encouraged in educational environments instead of subdued through mandatory dress codes. Others contend that requiring all students abide by the same regulations disregards cultural diversity within any given learning institution since traditional garb varies greatly across various backgrounds—for example gender specific clothing items often associated with religious affiliations may be prohibited due to general uniform policies whereas if allowed these details could demonstrate respect for varying levels of observance throughout classrooms worldwide. . Though both sides make valid arguments for why either approach yields better results—whether it’s improved academic scores or increased respect for individual identity—

"As the world continues to become increasingly interconnected and technology-driven, there is an ever-growing need for people who can understand and use data analytics. Data science professionals are in high demand due to their ability to take complex sets of data, analyze it, and draw meaningful conclusions from it. The process of becoming a successful data scientist requires a unique combination of technical knowledge, problem solving skills, and creativity. Data scientists work with large amounts of structured or unstructured data and must have excellent communication skills in order to communicate their findings effectively. As such, having a strong foundation in mathematics, statistics, programming languages like Python or R is essential for anyone looking to break into the field. In addition to these technical abilities however, those interested should also be proficient in critical thinking as well as creative problem solving techniques - both extremely important when trying to make sense out of large datasets with many variables involved. The ability to create powerful visualizations that convey insights quickly is another key component required by most employers today; learning how best design charts and graphs that accurately represent trends within the underlying data will go a long way towards making you stand out from your competition during interviews or job applications.

"I believe that the university education has a number of functions, not just the preparation for employment. One of the functions of the university is to provide a forum for critical thinking and the exchange of ideas. This is why I think that university students should be given the opportunity to explore different fields of study. This will give them the opportunity to grow as individuals and to gain a better understanding of the world around them.

Another function of the university is to provide a place where students can develop their skills. This is why I believe that students should have the opportunity to take courses in different areas, such as business, law, and journalism. This will give them the ability to find a career that is perfect for them and to develop the skills that they need to be successful in that field.

Finally, the university is a place where students can learn about the world around them. This is why I believe that students should be able to take courses in different areas, such as history, geography, and sociology.

When faced with a problem, it's easy to become overwhelmed or to give up too quickly. However, this quote can serve as a reminder that every problem is a chance for you to do your best, to become a better version of yourself. For example, in school you could use a difficult homework set to push yourself to learn the material more thoroughly rather than simply trying to get by or giving up. In sports, a difficult scrimmage could be the perfect opportunity to practice a difficult skill or to work on endurance. And in personal life, a challenging situation (such as a conflict with a friend) can be an opportunity to practice effective communication or to learn more about how to peacefully resolve conflicts.

The quote also encourages us to learn from our mistakes. For instance, if you fail a test, you can reflect on what you could have done differently and strive to make improvements next time. Similarly, in relationships, mistakes are inevitable—but rather than avoiding them, use mistakes as a chance to grow and learn how to be a better friend.

I agree with this quote as it encourages a growth mindset and emphasizes the importance of learning from mistakes. It reminds us that we have the potential to become better and that mistakes are not the end of our journey.",1
"I believe that education is a life-long process. This is because, as we get older, our knowledge and understanding of the world around us grows. This is especially true if we continue to education ourselves throughout our lives.

One example of this can be seen in the case of people who have earned a college degree. Many of these individuals have continued their education by earning a graduate degree. In fact, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, in 2009, over half of all adults who had earned a bachelor's degree had also earned a graduate or professional degree. This shows that, even after completing a college degree, many people continue to learn and grow.

This trend is also seen among people who have not earned a college degree. For example, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, in 2009, almost half of all adults who had not completed high school had also earned an associate's degree or a higher degree. This shows that, even if people do not have a college degree, they are still able to learn and grow.

This is why I believe that education is a life-long process. People continue to learn and grow throughout their lives, which is why it is important to continue to education ourselves.

My essay will be about a situation two years ago when I was a junior in high school. I had been very interested in the school's theater department, but I was too intimidated to audition for any shows. I knew that if I auditioned, I would likely be cast in a smaller role, and I was afraid I wouldn't do well enough. I talked to a close friend who was very passionate about theater and I could see that they wanted to encourage me to audition, but I couldn't work up the courage to actually do it. 

I believe the reason I was unsuccessful with participating in the school theater productions was because I was afraid of failure and I didn't have enough confidence in my own abilities. My lack of self-confidence kept me from taking action and kept me from fulfilling a potential passion. If I had pushed myself to step outside my comfort zone, I believe I could have achieved success.

If I had made a different decision two years ago and taken the risk of auditioning, it is possible that I could have gained a greater understanding of theater and my own skillset. In addition, my friend would have likely been proud to see me giving it my all and succeeding. Instead, I remained in my comfort zone, and my hesitation to take the risk caused me to remain inthat area and to miss out on an amazing opportunity.",1
"Space exploration has been a staple of science fiction for centuries, and with the development of technology, space travel is becoming more and more plausible. But what are the benefits that humanity could gain from exploring space? To answer this question it's important to look at examples of successful missions in recent years. One example would be NASA's Mars rover Curiosity mission in 2012. The rover was able to send back valuable data about the planet's environment, climate, and atmosphere which allowed us to understand the red planet better than ever before. This data also gave scientists insights into future potential colonisation of Mars as well as providing evidence that there was once water on its surface - a key indicator for life existing elsewhere in our solar system. Another benefit gained through space exploration is through satellite technology which helps support communications around the world such as broadband internet access or GPS navigation systems. Satellites placed in orbit provide real-time information about weather patterns allowing countries to make informed decisions related to public safety concerns like hurricanes or flooding events from severe storms – something essential for saving lives during natural disasters. In addition, satellites can detect changes in sea levels due to global warming with great accuracy so governments can plan environmental policies accordingly, helping protect wildlife habitats and preserving fragile ecosystems throughout our planet for generations to come. . Finally, we must consider how much understanding of ourselves we will receive by exploring further into outer space: searching for signs of other intelligent life forms while investigating new planets not only gives us hope but may uncover answers pertaining to questions humans have asked since the dawn of time - where did we come from? What else exists beyond our own solar system? Could this knowledge help bring peace between warring nations here on Earth? These are difficult questions but they raise awareness among people everywhere regarding our responsibility towards protecting our home planet while also expanding human horizons past what we currently know thus far about existence outside Earth’s atmosphere. .

"“Is Technology Making Our Lives Easier?” – this is a question many of us have asked ourselves in recent times. With the ever-evolving world of technology, it can be difficult to determine the answer. On one hand, technology has made our daily lives more efficient and convenient. We no longer need to wait in line at stores or make large trips for small items; with just a few clicks we can find almost anything online and have it delivered right to our doorstep. Technology has also opened up new opportunities for communication, allowing us to connect with people from all over the world without having to leave home. On the other hand, some argue that technology is eroding away our physical connections with people around us, replacing them with virtual ones rather than real life ones. People now spend less time talking face-to-face and instead prefer interacting through social media platforms such as Instagram or Twitter where conversations are often short and cursory. Additionally, there are concerns about how much information companies have access to when we use their products or services - firms like Google track every search query you make while Facebook knows your preferences based on what posts you ‘like’ or comment on. This lack of privacy makes many feel uneasy about using certain types of tech products or services due to fears that their personal data could be used against them in future scenarios they may not even know exist yet. In conclusion, although technology does offer immense benefits like improved efficiency and convenience in day-to-day activities such as shopping online or communicating digitally with friends across different countries; these advantages come at a cost too - namely reduced physical contact between individuals which can lead to feelings of isolation if prolonged for long periods of time ; plus heightened worries about security breaches when private data is shared online . Thus , whether technology ultimately makes our lives easier is largely subjective depending on individual circumstances , but overall it appears that its positives outweigh any potential negatives associated with its use .

"As the world continues to move forward with technology, it is hard not to notice the increased presence of robotics in our daily lives. From robotic vacuums that clean floors without any human intervention to self-driving cars on public roads, robots are quickly becoming a staple of modern life. However, with this trend comes an important ethical question: should robots be used in tasks that involve interacting and providing care for vulnerable populations such as children or elderly people?. The idea of using robots to provide care for those who are unable has plenty of advantages; they can be programmed accurately so there is no risk of error or negligence, they don’t require breaks or sleep like humans do, and their availability never wavers. This could potentially lead to cost savings for families and institutions alike as well as reduce time spent searching for good caregivers in certain areas due to shortages. On top of this, some have argued that there could even be psychological benefits from having a robot interact with someone rather than another human because it provides an unchanging presence which could offer comfort and familiarity in otherwise isolating situations. However, despite these potential benefits there are also several ethical issues at play when considering whether we should use robotics in caregiving roles. Firstly, while robots may appear lifelike upon first glance they lack the capacity for understanding emotions on a deeper level - something which many argue is key when caring for vulnerable individuals such as children or elderly people who need more empathy and compassion during difficult times than simply task completion efficiency provided by automated machines. Furthermore concerns arise around how much autonomy we give these machines - if given too much freedom then this raises questions about what would happen if a robot decides decide one course of action over another without consulting its users first which could result in dangerous consequences especially where safety is concerned (e.g., giving medication). . Ultimately it appears both sides must be weighed carefully before making any decisions about utilizing robotics within caregiving roles – both positive aspects such as

As students are given less time to complete a task, the consequences of longer hours could extend from both mental, psychological and physical capacities. With a shortened period of time to learn, there could be a higher level of stress or burnout for a student. During longer hours, students have less time to engage in after school activities, which may potentially affect their development outside of academics and may further cause psychological and mental strain. At the same time, a shorter period with an extended hours could provide the institution with a more efficient way of teaching, as more content can be covered in a shorter span of time. It is important to balance the need for an enhanced learning environment with the other important aspects of a student's life that could be affected from extended hours.",1
"There are a few key things to remember when considering this question. First, children are not born knowing how to cooperate or compete; these are skills that must be learned. Second, both cooperation and competition can be beneficial to children; it depends on the context in which they are used. Finally, it is possible for children to learn both cooperation and competition; they are not mutually exclusive.

With that said, I believe that children should be taught to cooperate. Cooperation is essential for many aspects of life, from working on a team to simply getting along with others. It is a skill that can be used in any situation, and it is one that will serve children well as they grow up.

There are a few reasons why I believe cooperation is so important for children. First, it teaches them to be considerate of others. When children cooperate, they have to think about the needs of others and how their actions will affect them. This is an important lesson to learn, as it will help them to be more thoughtful and considerate people as they grow up.

Second, cooperation teaches children to compromise. This is another essential life skill, as it is often necessary to compromise in order to get along with others. When children learn to compromise, they learn to see things from another person’s perspective and to find common ground. This is a skill that will be useful in all kinds of relationships, both personal and professional.

Finally, cooperation helps children to build relationships. When children cooperate, they have to communicate and work together. This can help them to build strong relationships with others, as they learn to trust and rely on each other. These are important skills to have, both in childhood and adulthood.

Of course, competition can also be beneficial to children. It can teach them to set goals and to work hard to achieve them. It can also teach them to be resilient in the face of failure. However, I believe that cooperation is more important, as it is a skill that can be used in any situation and that will help children throughout their lives.

"The Internet of Things (IoT) is revolutionizing the way we live and work every day. It has changed the way we communicate, shop, travel, and entertain ourselves by connecting physical objects to the digital world. With billions of interconnected devices around us all working together in harmony it’s no surprise that IoT has become such a major part of our lives. One major application for the Internet of Things is its use in smart homes. There are a multitude of products on the market now from voice-controlled thermostats to refrigerators that can track your grocery list. Once installed into your home these products offer great convenience as well as energy savings from more efficient use of resources like air conditioning or lighting systems when you're away from home or asleep at night. All this is possible thanks to IoT technology which allows these connected devices to “talk” with each other over wireless networks and take instructions directly from you via smartphone apps or even Amazon's Alexa virtual assistant device!. Another application for the internet of things lies in industrial settings where machines are used to automate repetitive processes such as manufacturing parts, controlling production lines, and monitoring equipment performance levels. By allowing workers to monitor their machines remotely they can quickly access data on how they’re performing allowing them to adjust production rates accordingly while also minimizing downtime due to unexpected breakdowns or malfunctions which leads again towards increased efficiency and cost savings within an organization. . Finally, think about how much safer our roads could be if all cars were connected through IoT technology so that crash prevention systems could be implemented? If two cars got too close together sensors inside both vehicles would detect this potential hazard before any damage was done thus saving lives not only for those inside but anyone else nearby who might have been impacted if an accident happened instead!. . In conclusion, it's clear that the Internet of Things has come a long way since its inception over 20 years ago and continues pushing boundaries every day thanks largely in

Thomas Jefferson famously said, ""Determine never to be idle...it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" Jefferson himself was living proof that hard work pays off. He wrote hundreds of letters, wrote the Declaration of Independence, designed and built his home, Monticello, studied science and the arts, and served as the third President of the United States. All of these successes were the result of Jefferson's commitment to never be idle, and to always be doing something productive. 

From Jefferson's life and his famous words, we can draw two important lessons about the benefits of hard work: first, adequate planning can help you achieve your goals, no matter how ambitious they may be. Second, the more effort you put into something, the better the outcome will be. Jefferson once said, ""I'm a great believer in luck, and I find the harder I work, the more I have of it."" This is the kind of attitude we should have towards hard work: it not only gets us closer to achieving our goals, it also makes us more fortunate and more successful in the process.",1

During the darkest times, a positive attitude can be the light that leads the way. A recent example that stands out is the story of my grandmother. Despite her own health battle, she maintained an unwavering brightness that buoyed our family and us. Every day she shared a joke, or a funny story - her attitude as resilient as ever. From her example, I learned the importance of having a positive attitude even during difficult times. 

Having a positive attitude is an important part of managing difficult times, as it fosters resilience and strength. It can be a great source of moral support during difficult situations and can even help bring about concrete solutions to existing problem. Other benefits include better self-care and enhanced mental health. 

Supporting a loved one during a difficult time requires an understanding of their individual needs. One way to do this is to actively listen and provide a shoulder to lean on as they process their emotions. Other ideas include providing helpful advice, if appropriate, or helping them find additional resources, such as therapy or support groups, if needed.  

At the end of the day, having a positive attitude during a difficult time is not easy but is invaluable. It can help an individual continue to have faith in their journey, even in the darkness. It is a reminder that brighter days will be ahead, and it is a reminder to be kind to oneself.",1
"The use of technology in the classroom has revolutionized the way students learn. While many teachers have embraced this shift, there are still those who have reservations about its effectiveness and utility. But whether one loves it or hates it, there is no denying that technology has become an integral part of today’s classrooms. When used correctly, technology can be a powerful tool for student learning. It makes instruction more engaging and allows students to take ownership of their education. Students can actively participate in lessons with interactive whiteboards, online simulations, virtual labs and collaborative activities like group discussions boards or video conferencing. They’re also able to extend their knowledge by researching topics using computers and other digital information sources like databases and websites designed specifically for educational purposes. Classroom teachers often find that incorporating technology into instruction helps them reach out to all types of learners—those who learn best through text-based material as well as those who respond better when visual aids such as presentations are included in lessons. Technology also gives teachers an opportunity to assess student understanding much quicker than traditional paper-and-pencil exams might allow them too; they’re able give feedback almost immediately after assessing each individual response from their class via eActivities or quizzes administered on computer software programs like NearPod or Kahoot!. This also frees up additional time for further exploration with more involved projects geared toward helping students develop critical thinking skills rather than just surface level memorization of facts, figures and dates associated with class material that may not stick after exams end but will help prepare them for real world applications later on down the line should they pursue a career related to what was learned within the coursework itself. In conclusion, while some educators may struggle adapting current teaching methods to include modern technological advances while others thrive at moving forward into tech-enabled curriculums; either way it's clear that use of said technologies within lesson plans offer tremendous benefits both inside & outside the classroom

Known for his hard-working attitude and enthusiasm on the football pitch, Cristiano Ronaldo has gone on to become one of the most decorated footballers of all time. His enthusiasm for his sport has been instrumental in his development into one of the greatest players of all time. His enthusiasm also keeps him motivated to keep performing at a high level; something that clearly shows in his game.

My mother is another example of someone who has seen success due to her enthusiasm; she went from being unemployed to running a successful catering business. She was passionate about creating a business, and her enthusiasm for the work kept her motivated to pursue her dreams. Her enthusiasm was crucial in helping her to stay focused and motivated, and without it she might not have achieved the success she enjoys today.

In conclusion, enthusiasm is essential for success. When pursuing our dreams, we must maintain an enthusiastic and hard-working attitude. Examples such as Cristiano Ronaldo and my mother illustrate how this attitude can lead to great success.",1
"Dear State Senator,

I am writing to express my opinion on the topic of the Electoral College versus election by popular vote for the president of the United States. As a student in grade 8, I have been learning about the different ways that the president is elected and the pros and cons of each method.

In my opinion, the Electoral College is a fairer way to elect the president because it ensures that smaller states have a voice in the election. If we were to switch to a popular vote system, larger states like California and New York would have a disproportionate amount of power in deciding who becomes the president. This would be unfair to the smaller states, who would have little to no say in the election.

Additionally, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in a variety of states, rather than just focusing on the most populous ones. This ensures that candidates have to consider the needs and concerns of people from all over the country, rather than just those in heavily populated areas.

I understand that some people argue that the Electoral College is outdated and that a popular vote system would be more democratic. However, I believe that the Electoral College still serves a valuable purpose in ensuring that the president is elected in a way that is fair and representative of the entire country.

To support my argument, I would like to point to the 2016 presidential election. In this election, Donald Trump won the presidency despite losing the popular vote to Hillary Clinton. If we had a popular vote system, Trump would not have been elected, even though he won a majority of the electoral votes. This shows that the Electoral College can sometimes lead to different results than a popular vote system, and that it can be beneficial in ensuring that the president is elected in a way that is representative of the country as a whole.

In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College is a fair and effective way to elect the president of the United States. It ensures that smaller states have a voice in the election and encourages candidates to campaign in a variety of states. I urge you to consider the benefits of the Electoral College and to resist any efforts to switch to a popular vote system.

Sincerely,

"Success is not just about achieving the desired goal but also about the journey that leads to it. While some people prefer to stick to their comfort zone and do only what they are already good at, others are willing to take risks, try new things, and push their boundaries to achieve success. In my opinion, successful people are those who are open to new experiences and willing to take risks, as this can lead to personal and professional growth, innovation, and new opportunities.

Firstly, trying new things and taking risks allows individuals to step out of their comfort zone and venture into uncharted territory. By doing so, they challenge themselves, learn new skills, and gain new perspectives on life. For example, a person who has always been good at playing sports may decide to try their hand at music or art. While it may not come naturally to them at first, the experience will teach them new skills, such as patience, discipline, and perseverance, which they can apply in other areas of their life.

Secondly, taking risks and trying new things can lead to innovation and creativity. When individuals step outside of their comfort zone, they are forced to think differently and come up with new ideas. For instance, a scientist who has been conducting research in a particular field for years may decide to experiment with a new approach or technology. This may lead to new discoveries, inventions, and breakthroughs.

Finally, taking risks and trying new things can lead to new opportunities and success. By venturing into new territory, individuals may meet new people, build new networks, and discover new opportunities. For example, a businessperson who has always focused on one particular market may decide to expand into new markets. This may lead to new customers, increased profits, and greater success.

In conclusion, while it may be tempting to stick to what we already know, successful people are those who are willing to take risks and try new things. By doing so, they open themselves up to new experiences, gain new skills, and can achieve personal and professional growth. Moreover, taking risks and trying new things can lead to innovation, creativity, and new opportunities. Therefore, I strongly agree that successful people are those who are willing to step outside of their comfort zone and take risks.

Growing up, I was entranced by the beautiful sound of the violin—a classical instrument which has been in existence since the 16th century in Europe. I was enchanted by the complexity and range of emotion that the instrument could convey when played skillfully. As I conducted research into the instrument's history, I developed an even greater appreciation for its extraordinary heritage and the history of its renowned composers.  

I eagerly signed up for violin lessons. However, I soon realized that learning to play the violin is an incredibly taxing process that requires immense dedication, time, and focus to become proficient. You need to practice regularly in order to ensure that you can play the instrument comfortably and develop both musical and technical skills such as knowing fingering positions, posture, and having an overall command of the instrument’s sound. 

My first experiences taking violin lessons were humbling. I was surrounded by much more experienced and knowledgeable musicians, yet the teacher was patient with me and helped me gradually become more comfortable and confident with the instrument. Despite the initial difficulty, I saw firsthand the sheer joy of mastering a new piece and was inspired by those around me to push my limits and strive to get to the point of being able to perform confidently.

At the same time, I realized the detrimental consequences of not practicing regularly. Neglecting practice can lead to slipping technical ability, as well as a loss of confidence and motivation. Through this experience, my attitude and perspective on the violin shifted from a source of struggle to a place of peace and comfort. Today, I am able to take immense joy in playing the violin, something that I never imagined I would be doing.",1
"On the one hand, it is possible that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years due to several factors. Firstly, the rise of ride-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft has already reduced the need for individuals to own their own cars. This trend is likely to continue as more people become accustomed to the convenience and cost-effectiveness of using these services. Secondly, the development of autonomous vehicles may lead to a reduction in the number of cars on the road. With self-driving cars, there would be no need for individuals to own their own vehicles, as they could simply summon a car when needed. This would also reduce the number of accidents on the road, as autonomous vehicles would be programmed to drive more safely than human drivers. Finally, the increasing concern for the environment and the need to reduce carbon emissions may lead to a shift towards more sustainable modes of transportation, such as public transit, biking, and walking.

On the other hand, there are also reasons to believe that there will be more cars in use in twenty years. Firstly, the global population is expected to continue to grow, which means that there will be more people who need to travel to work, school, and other destinations. This will increase the demand for cars, especially in developing countries where car ownership is still relatively low. Secondly, the rise of electric cars may make car ownership more attractive, as they are more environmentally friendly and have lower operating costs than traditional gasoline-powered cars. As the technology improves and the price of electric cars becomes more affordable, more people may choose to own their own cars rather than rely on ride-sharing or public transit. Finally, the development of new technologies such as flying cars and hyperloops may also increase the number of cars in use, as they offer new and faster ways to travel.

In conclusion, it is difficult to predict with certainty whether there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years. While there are some trends that suggest a reduction in car ownership, there are also factors that may lead to an increase in the number of cars on the road. Ultimately, the future of transportation will depend on a complex interplay of technological, economic, social, and environmental factors.

"When thinking about the topic of procrastination, it is essential to discuss why individuals tend to put things off even when they are aware of the consequences. It can be difficult to resist the temptation of indulging in activities that seem more pleasurable than completing tasks that may not have an immediate reward. Procrastination often occurs when people feel overwhelmed by a task at hand or lack motivation. However, if left unchecked this habit can lead to major issues such as missed deadlines and poorer quality work. The primary reason why people fall into this trap is because they overestimate their ability to complete certain tasks within a given time frame and set unrealistic expectations for themselves. For example, if someone has two weeks to finish an assignment but assumes it will only take one week then suddenly having one day left before its due date could cause significant stress resulting in them putting it off until later on instead of using their available time efficiently from the start. Other causes include overthinking a task or feeling too paralyzed by perfectionism which leads them down a rabbit hole instead of taking action straight away; both scenarios result in minimal progress being made causing further procrastinating habits. Nevertheless, there are ways we can overcome this problem with some adjustments in our daily routine like breaking down larger projects into smaller pieces so that each step seems less intimidating as well as setting realistic goals rather than aiming too high right away and thus avoiding burnout along the way towards achieving our end results - something important enough since procrastinating just compounds all existing difficulties making any kind of progression much harder than necessary! Additionally establishing regular check-ins with ourselves throughout each project gives us an opportunity for reflection on what has been accomplished already which helps alleviate anxiety associated with large scale undertakings while also providing feedback allowing us make improvements where needed quicker instead waiting until deadline approaches again only half finished!. . . Finally understanding how our brain works when under pressure could prove instrumental helping avoid future relapses - primarily acknowledging potential distractions beforehand while actively planning

"Are Video Games Beneficial or Detrimental to the Minds of Young Children?. In recent years, video games have become increasingly popular among children and adolescents. Some believe that these games are beneficial for young minds as they can help foster creativity, problem-solving skills, and hand-eye coordination. However, others argue that these games have a negative effect on mental health and may even lead to addiction in some cases. So what is the truth? Are video games beneficial or detrimental to the minds of young children?. When it comes to benefits, there are certainly some advantages associated with playing video games. One study found that playing action video games improved players' spatial learning capabilities over time when compared with those who did not play any type of game at all (Mitchell et al., 2018). Additionally, research has shown that puzzle-based video games can sharpen problem solving skills by teaching players how to recognize patterns and come up with creative solutions (Kirby et al., 2017). Furthermore, neuroscientists have recently discovered that playing certain types of multi-player online role-playing strategy (MMORPG) could improve cognitive function such as attention span and working memory (Ding et al., 2020). Finally, many studies have also demonstrated an improvement in hand-eye coordination after regular gaming sessions (Feng & Spence 2011; Huberty 2015). However, there are potential drawbacks associated with too much gaming at a young age as well. These include increased levels of stress (Mihailovic & Ristic 2016), anxiety symptoms such as worry about failure or success during game play(Lopez et al., 2019), depression due poor performance in postgame analysis(Strasburger 2009), social isolation due to long hours spent alone in front of screen(Brenner 2013)and perhaps most concerningly - addiction which has been linked by some researchers to violent tendencies due compulsive need for stimulation from gaming activity(Gentile

"The automobile industry has been an integral part of modern transportation for over a century. In recent years, there has been a growing concern about the environmental impact of cars, the rise of ride-sharing services, and the development of autonomous vehicles. These factors lead some people to believe that there will be fewer cars on the roads in the future. In this essay, I will explain why I believe that in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.

Firstly, the global push for reducing carbon emissions is a significant factor that will lead to a decrease in car usage. Governments worldwide are introducing measures to reduce the number of cars on the road and promote the use of public transport, cycling, and walking. For instance, some countries are imposing higher taxes on vehicles with high fuel consumption, while others are offering incentives for electric and hybrid cars. According to the Global EV Outlook 2021 report, the number of electric cars on the road worldwide has increased from 17,000 in 2010 to over 10 million in 2020. This trend is expected to continue, and electric cars are projected to account for over 50% of new car sales by 2040.

Secondly, the rise of ride-sharing services like Uber, Lyft, and Didi Chuxing is changing the way people think about car ownership. Instead of owning a car, people are choosing to use ride-sharing services as a more convenient and cost-effective option. A study by the University of California, Berkeley, found that each shared car replaces nine to thirteen individually owned vehicles, reducing the number of cars on the road. Ride-sharing services are also making it easier for people to live without a car in urban areas, where public transport is readily available.

Finally, the development of autonomous vehicles is another reason why there will be fewer cars on the road in the future. Autonomous vehicles have the potential to reduce the number of accidents caused by human error, decrease traffic congestion, and make better use of road space. They can also be used for ride-sharing services, reducing the need for individual car ownership. According to a report by the Boston Consulting Group, autonomous vehicles could reduce the number of vehicles on the road by up to 60% by 2030.

In conclusion, there are several reasons why there will be fewer cars on the road in twenty years than there are today. The global push for reducing carbon emissions, the rise of ride-sharing services, and the development of autonomous vehicles are all factors that contribute to this trend. While cars will still be an essential part of transportation, their usage is expected to decrease as people opt for more sustainable and convenient alternatives.

"When it comes to the topic of animal rescue and adoption, there is a great deal that needs to be discussed. We often think of animal rescue as something done by organizations such as shelters or even private individuals. However, adopting an animal in need can bring both joy and responsibility into one's life, as well as provide a much-needed home for an otherwise homeless creature. Animal rescue should be approached with both caution and consideration. Before deciding on taking in an animal into your family, it’s important to consider what type of pet would work best within the current lifestyle you have established. Adopting an older dog may require more patience than if you were to adopt a pup - though all animals deserve love regardless! Therefore, researching breeds and personalities is essential when selecting which companion would fit in your household most suitably. It’s also important to remember that rescuing animals from any situation doesn't always mean they will be perfectly suited for being housed inside someone's home; some animals may not come already trained or lacking basic socialization skills due to prior experiences - whether it was previously living outside or early abuse before making its way into the sheltering system. Consequently, it’s necessary for adopters to approach any new pet with care and understanding while providing sufficient time for them to adjust properly after transitioning from their previous environment into yours (which might include allowing them space initially until they become comfortable). In addition, many shelters offer additional help such as training classes so make sure take advantage of these extra benefits available when possible!. . By giving rescued pets another chance at life through adoption rather than buying from breeders/pet stores supporting this message -- “Adopt Don’t Shop"" -- allows us further demonstrate our commitment toward helping those who are unable speak up for themselves while providing them companionship they need & deserve just like other living beings on this planet Earth!

"In recent years, the use of virtual reality (VR) technology in education has become increasingly popular. This essay will explore why VR is an effective teaching tool, discuss how it can be used to enhance learning experiences and outline the potential challenges associated with its use. First and foremost, VR provides a more immersive experience than traditional teaching methods, allowing students to interact directly with a 3D environment or simulation as if they were actually there. As opposed to just reading about something or watching a video demonstration, students are able to engage in subject material through hands-on activities that provide tangible results when completed correctly. In addition, because these simulations depict real life scenarios and environments accurately enough for users to feel like they’re truly “in” them – not just looking at them on screen – students are able to observe firsthand the consequences of their actions within those parameters; this encourages critical thinking skills and allows them to better understand topics from different perspectives. Furthermore, by providing realistic visuals that draw learners into material faster than text-based content ever could , teachers find themselves free from monotonous lectures - instead being enabled by VR-driven lessons plans that keep pupils engaged mentally throughout each class period. When it comes down using VR technology as part of educational efforts effectively though, teachers must incorporate certain strategies into their lesson plans so as ensure maximum absorption of knowledge without overwhelming pupils: utilizing detailed instruction manuals prior starting any activity allows learners to gain familiarity with provided tools beforehand; while beginning smaller projects before moving onto larger ones prevents boredom setting in during extended courses; furthermore having participants work together rather than alone also helps foster teamwork capabilities while simultaneously engaging minds actively - all thanks due its ability quickly break down barriers between members that might otherwise take much longer establish naturally. . Despite all these advantages however there remain some inherent limitations when it comes incorporating Virtual Reality technologies into everyday classroom settings: Perhaps most notably cost often presents itself problem given fact current technological advancements require relatively expensive hardware maintain quality

"The incredible journey of the Monarch butterfly is an inspiring story filled with resilience and courage. Every year, millions of these delicate creatures make the long-distance trek from Mexico to Canada and back. It is estimated that a single butterfly will travel up to 4,000 km in its lifetime – a remarkable feat considering their small size!. Despite migration being one of the most important natural processes for species survival, it also comes with many risks. The Monarch butterflies have to face extreme temperatures, predators and storms as they traverse North America on their annual voyage. Although some individuals are able to reach their destination in one season, most take two or three years before completing this immense undertaking. One particularly daunting obstacle for Monarchs is urbanization: cities provide warmth during cold winter days but can be extremely challenging for these creatures due to light pollution at night and lack of food sources along roadsides. Despite such impediments, though, researchers still see large numbers passing through metropolitan centers each fall showing just how capable these organisms are!. . Another fascinating aspect about the yearly migration of Monarchs is how individual butterflies can remember where they left off in prior seasons; it has been found that young ones tend to follow in older generations’ footsteps while returning southward after spending summer months further north – something truly remarkable given their short life spans!. But not only do these winged wonders show amazing navigation skills; they also teach us an important lesson on endurance. By observing them fly through adversity time and again despite all odds against them we gain insight into our own capacity for perseverance when faced with difficult situations or seemingly impossible tasks ahead – proving that anything can be achieved if we have enough determination. . .

"Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. There are several reasons why cell phone use behind the wheel can be dangerous. 
 
First and foremost, cell phone use is a major distraction for drivers. Whether a driver is talking, texting, or using apps, their attention is drawn away from the important task of safely navigating traffic. Numerous studies have shown that it only takes a few seconds of distraction for hazards to arise while driving. Reaching for a phone, reading or sending a message takes a driver's eyes off the road for prolonged periods. This raises the risk of an accident.

Some people argue that hands-free use is safer than handheld phone conversations. However, the distraction is not just visual but also cognitive. Even hands-free calling requires the driver's brain to concentrate on the conversation instead of on their surroundings. Drivers engaged in phone discussions are less aware of their speed and location on the road. Reaction times are slower for drivers cognitively occupied with a phone call compared to an unimpaired driver. 

Cell phone use can also impair a driver's judgment and decision making. Receiving or sending messages leads drivers to take risks like glancing at their phone longer than they estimated, staring at it while driving at high speeds, or swerving into other lanes to focus on their phone screen instead of the road. This poor judgment endangers not only the driver but also other passengers and other vehicles on the road.

For the safety of all citizens who share the roads, cell phone use should remain prohibited while driving. Advancements in technology now allow phones to be integrated safely into vehicles through features like hands-free calling and voice assistants. Until fully self-driving cars are developed and regulated, drivers need their full attention focused on the complex task of controlling a potentially lethal machine like a motor vehicle. Using a cell phone distracts from that vital responsibility and should remain against the law for all drivers.",1

Dear [Senator’s Name],

I am writing to you today to express my opinion on the Electoral College system in the United States. As a student, I have been studying the history and workings of our democratic system, including the Electoral College. After careful consideration and analysis of different perspectives, I have come to the conclusion that the Electoral College should be abolished and replaced with a simple popular vote.

First, the Electoral College is an outdated system that does not reflect the will of the people. In the last five presidential elections, the winner of the popular vote did not win the Electoral College four times. This means that the person who received the most votes from the citizens of the United States was not elected as the president. This is a clear violation of the democratic principle of “one person, one vote.”

Second, the Electoral College gives disproportionate power to small states. Because each state is guaranteed a minimum of three electors, regardless of its population, a vote in a small state like Wyoming has four times the power of a vote in a large state like California. This means that the interests and needs of small states are often favored over those of larger states, which is unfair to the majority of the population.

Third, the Electoral College creates an uneven playing field for candidates. Because most states award all their electoral votes to the candidate who wins the popular vote in their state, candidates focus their campaigns on swing states instead of the needs of the entire country. This means that some states and their issues are ignored, while others receive disproportionate attention.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a flawed system that needs to be replaced with a simple popular vote. A popular vote would ensure that the winner of the presidency reflects the will of the people and that every vote counts equally. This would be a more fair and just system for all Americans.

Thank you for your attention to this important matter.

Sincerely,

"We all know the importance of exercise in maintaining a healthy lifestyle. But often overlooked are the benefits that can be obtained from taking part in regular cardiovascular activities such as running or biking. Studies have shown that getting out on your feet and having an active routine can improve physical, mental, and emotional wellbeing. Physically, cardio is important for heart health as it helps to strengthen the heart muscle so it can pump blood more efficiently throughout our body. Regular aerobic activity lowers resting heart rate which means less strain on our hearts when we’re at rest or doing other activities like walking up stairs or carrying groceries around the house. It also increases lung capacity by allowing us to take bigger breaths during movement which aids oxygen circulation within our bodies; this leads to improved endurance over time and allows us to get through more strenuous tasks with greater ease. Additionally, since cardio involves moving most major muscles groups its great for improving strength while burning calories and fat at the same time- making it an effective tool in weight management strategies as well!. In addition to its physical advantages, running has been linked to increased mental clarity due its ability channel energy into productive thought processes rather than wasteful rumination patterns common among those who lead sedentary lives styles; this helps keep stress levels low while sharpening cognitive function overall! Exercise also releases endorphins (known colloquially as “feel good hormones”) which act similarly to serotonin elevating moods almost immediately upon participating! Not only does this create positive rewards loops reinforcing positive behavior but when done outside you may even benefit from exposure Vitamin D provided by sunlight – further promoting a sense of wellbeing ! Lastly engaging in outdoor exercises increases ones connection with nature leading them towards appreciating their environment rather than viewing it simply as background scenery. . All things considered there's no doubt that hitting pavement for some jogging every now and then isn't just a great way stay physically fit but mentally alert too- why not give yourself permission today

Completing four years of high school is often seen as the ideal educational path and is highly beneficial for students. While an extra year of schooling can seem intimidating, it results in a number of educational, personal, and professional advantages.

Those who complete the four year plan will find greater access to more rigorous coursework, enabling meaningful intellectual and personal growth. With access to a broader range of classes, students will be able to explore new interests while developing a deeper understanding of existing ones. Furthermore, extra categories of electives and enriched curricula are often available to those who take an additional year. This allows students to pursue meaningful extracurricular activities, participate in valuable internship and volunteer opportunities, or even attempt to fulfill early college credit requirements.

Though an extra year of school may mean a later start to college, the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. Students will be better equipped for college-level work, making them more likely to succeed in their academic pursuits. Additionally, having extra time to refine both their skills and interests can result in more competitive applications.

In contrast to the four year plan, opting for three years of high school does have its benefits. Most notably, students who graduate early may have the opportunity to enter college with a head start, allowing them to adjust quickly to college life and possibly graduate early.

Ultimately, the best course for each student is dependent on individual considerations and should be approached with due diligence. Taking the extra year of high school can have invaluable benefits, potentially providing immersive learning experiences to open doors for brighter futures.",1
"There are a few things to consider when answering this question. The first is what age group you are talking about. Young children, for example, are not developmentally able to understand or participate in complex cooperative games. They are, however, able to understand and participate in simple cooperative games, such as sharing and taking turns. As children get older and develop more complex social and cognitive skills, they are able to participate in more complex cooperative games and activities.

The second thing to consider is what you mean by ""cooperation."" There are different types of cooperation, and not all of them are beneficial for children. For example, some people might view competition as a form of cooperation, because in order to compete, you have to work together with other people. However, other people might view competition as a negative thing, because it can lead to people feeling jealous, resentful, or angry towards others.

So, overall, I think it depends on the age of the child and what you mean by ""cooperation."" If you are talking about young children, then I think it is beneficial for them to learn simple cooperative skills, such as sharing and taking turns. If you are talking about older children, then I think it depends on what type of cooperation you are talking about. If you are talking about competition, then I think it depends on the child and the context of the competition. If you are talking about cooperative activities that are beneficial for everyone involved, then I think it is always a good idea to teach children how to cooperate.

"In recent years, the importance of degree certificates has increased significantly, especially in the job market. Many organizations require potential employees to hold certain academic qualifications to be even considered for a position. While some may argue that this emphasis on academic qualifications is misleading for young people, I believe that it is still vital to have a degree certificate for a successful career.

Firstly, academic qualifications show that an individual has the ability to learn and persevere in a formal educational setting. Obtaining a degree requires dedication, time-management, and discipline, all of which are traits that are highly valued in the workplace. Moreover, a degree certificate can indicate that a person has achieved a certain level of knowledge and proficiency in a particular subject area. This can be highly beneficial in job interviews and may set the individual apart from those without a degree.

Secondly, a degree certificate serves as a foundation for further career growth and development. With a solid academic background, an individual can seek out opportunities for higher education, such as pursuing a master's degree or a Ph. D. This not only provides a deeper understanding of a particular subject but also increases the individual's chances of career advancement and higher salaries.

However, it is also essential to note that a degree certificate is not the only factor involved in a successful career. An individual's soft skills, such as communication, problem-solving, and teamwork, are equally important. These skills cannot be taught in the classroom and are often gained through work experience and real-life situations. Employers are also increasingly looking for candidates with practical skills and experience, in addition to academic qualifications.

In conclusion, while it is essential to recognize that academic qualifications are not the only indicator of success, they are still an essential aspect of career development. A degree certificate demonstrates an individual's ability to learn and provides a foundation for further growth and development. However, it is equally important to emphasize the importance of soft skills and work experience in addition to academic qualifications.

"There is no one answer to this question, as people's enjoyment of life can vary greatly depending on their age. However, there are a few general trends that can be observed.

First, younger people tend to enjoy life more than older people do. This is likely due to the fact that they are still in the process of discovering and exploring the world around them. They are also more likely to be actively engaged in their hobbies and activities, which can add a lot of enjoyment and satisfaction to their lives.

Second, people who are in a good relationship with their family and friends are generally more happy and enjoy life more than people who are not in such a relationship. This is likely because they have someone to share their experiences and happiness with, and they can rely on these people to support and encourage them.

Finally, people who have a strong sense of self-identity and who are comfortable in their own skin tend to enjoy life more than people who do not. This is because they are able to live life to the fullest and to take advantage of all the opportunities that life has to offer.

Firstly, students have their own lives outside of school. Longer school days would give them less time to relax or pursue their own personal interests. This could lead to burnout and cause them to resent their studies even more than they may already. 

Secondly, an increase in the amount of time spent at school would reduce the amount of physical activities students are able to participate in. Mental and physical health are both important, and longer days could lead to students developing an unbalanced lifestyle, which could potentially have serious consequences.

Lastly, having longer school days would lead to an increase in the amount of homework assigned. Teachers would end up assigning more so that students can keep up with the contents covered in school, but this would further overburden students and leave less time for family and personal leisure time. 

In conclusion, the school board should not add one and a half hours to each school day. Not only would it be detrimental to students’ mental and physical health, but it would also reduce the amount of free time they have to do other activities, leading to an overall decrease in their quality of life. It is essential that students have adequate time to pursue activities that they enjoy and relax.",1

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the Electoral College system and to argue in favor of keeping it, as opposed to changing to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. After carefully considering the information presented in various texts, including ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, and ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Judge Richard A. Posner, I believe that the Electoral College remains the most effective and beneficial method of electing our nation's leader.

One of the key reasons to retain the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome, as stated by Judge Richard A. Posner in his article. In the Electoral College system, the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote tends to exceed their share of the popular vote, creating a clear and decisive outcome. This reduces the likelihood of disputes over the election results, unlike what may occur in a direct popular vote system.

Moreover, the Electoral College ensures that the President has trans-regional appeal, as mentioned by Judge Posner. With no region having enough electoral votes to elect a President, candidates are incentivized to appeal to a broad range of voters across different regions. This helps to prevent the election of a candidate with only regional support, promoting national unity and representation for all citizens.

The existence of swing states is another significant advantage of the Electoral College system, as explained by Judge Posner. By focusing campaign efforts on toss-up states, candidates are compelled to pay closer attention to the concerns, interests, and needs of these states and their constituents. This leads to a more informed and thoughtful electorate, as swing state voters play a pivotal role in deciding the outcome of the election.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that large states are not overlooked, as highlighted by Judge Posner. In a campaign, presidential candidates give more attention to states with larger populations due to the number of electoral votes at stake. This balances the political influence of large states, counteracting the mal-apportionment of power caused by the Senate's constitutional mandate for equal representation of each state.

Lastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections, as mentioned by Judge Posner. By requiring a candidate to win a majority of electoral votes to secure the presidency, the system avoids the complications and costs associated with subsequent run-off elections. Instead, it ensures a clear winner, promoting stability and efficiency in the election process.

While some argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states considered ""safe"" for a particular party, it is important to emphasize that voters are motivated by their desire to express a political preference, as mentioned in Judge Posner's article. The knowledge that their vote may not directly impact the election's outcome does not prevent individuals from participating in the democratic process and exercising their right to vote.

In conclusion, the Electoral College remains a crucial institution that upholds the principles of our Constitution and supports our democratic system. Its preservation ensures a fair and representative election process, while promoting national unity, thoughtful campaigning, and the importance of every region's voice. For these reasons, I urge you to support the retention of the Electoral College and reject any proposals to change to a popular vote system.

Thank you for your attention to this important matter. I trust that you will consider my perspective and weigh it alongside the views of others to make an informed decision that best serves our nation's interests. I appreciate your dedication and service to our state and our country.

Sincerely,

"The Power of Music in Education. Music has long been a powerful force for learning, growth, and development. Its influence is far-reaching and can be seen from the classroom to the boardroom. In education specifically, music can serve as an effective tool for enhancing student engagement, improving motivation levels, increasing focus and attention spans, developing problem-solving skills, fostering creativity and encouraging critical thinking. For starters, the use of music in education creates an environment that is both engaging and enjoyable for students. The energy it brings to a lesson plan or activity can captivate even those who may have had difficulty focusing before. For example, by introducing background music during lessons on any subject matter (maths equations or foreign language vocabulary) students are more likely to become engaged with what they are learning due to being entertained while doing so. This helps facilitate understanding of complex topics that they might otherwise struggle with if taught without any form of auditory stimulation at all – having some background noise shifts their brain into gear!. Furthermore studies also suggest that exposing children’s minds to musical elements early on will help cultivate better cognitive abilities over time – such as improved memory recall performance when compared to nonmusical contexts (Schellenberg 2006). Listening exercises that involve instruments like drums provide rhythm which synchronises motor movements resulting in increased coordination between body parts; making movement tasks easier than ever before! Such activities foster physical development too – useful especially if your school focuses on physical education as part of its daily routine! Not only this but it helps develop emotional intelligence amongst youngsters leading them towards better self regulation techniques (Furman & Unsworth 2013). . Additionally teaching through song is another way teachers can find success when educating students - whether singing a nursery rhyme about numbers or humming along with lyrics about science facts - melodies encourage participation making regular lectures much more interactive ! Also depending upon different genres there are always opportunities for creating fun dance moves which encourages good exercise habits among

"The importance of a good night's sleep has been increasingly emphasized in recent years, and for good reason. Getting enough quality sleep is essential to overall physical and mental health; it can improve concentration, memory, creativity, decision-making ability, and much more. However, with tight schedules and the abundance of late-night activities available today, many people struggle to get adequate rest each night. It is important to understand that a good night’s sleep is more than just an indulgence or luxury; it’s vital for our cognitive functioning, emotional wellbeing and physical health. Unfortunately though, most adults average 6-7 hours of broken or fragmented sleep per night – far less than the 8–10 recommended by doctors. Studies show that running on little to no sleep leads to increased risk of heart disease along with anxiety and depression due to lack of focus during daily tasks as well as difficulty managing emotions such as anger or stress caused by poor sleeping habits. In order to ensure you are getting enough high-quality rest each night there are various steps one may take: avoid drinking too much caffeine late in the day since this can lead to disrupted sleeping patterns; establish a regular bedtime routine so your body knows when it’s time for shutting down; try not have any screens (e.g., phones/tablets) in your bedroom at least 1 hour before going off which will help reduce blue light exposure from these devices; also having some sort of relaxing activity such as reading or taking a warm bath beforehand reduces stress levels and makes falling asleep easier!. Finally if all else fails speak with a doctor who may be able recommend certain medications or practices specifically tailored towards improving one’s quality of life through better sleeping habits - this could include changes like dieting tips dietary supplements nutrition strategies etc. . All things considered making sure we get plenty restful nights should be taken seriously because our bodies rely on it - plus its important factor both

"Education is one of the most important elements in a successful life, and it's something that no one should take lightly. For students, quality education has long been seen as an essential building block to success in any field they choose to pursue. But what exactly makes up a quality education? In this essay, I will discuss some of the key components that make up an educational experience which leads to success. First and foremost, a good educational system must provide access to high-quality resources for learning. This includes textbooks, library materials and electronic media such as online databases or digital libraries. It also means providing teachers who are knowledgeable about their topic area and can impart information clearly to their students. Accessibility of course material should be easy for all students regardless of ability level or background; otherwise there would likely be gaps in knowledge among different student groups which could lead them down divergent paths later on in life. In addition to having access to useful material, teachers must also foster cooperative learning environments inside the classroom where everyone feels comfortable asking questions or engaging with each other’s ideas without fear of judgment or ridicule from classmates or instructors alike. This type of collaborative atmosphere encourages critical thinking skills while fostering interpersonal relationships between peers – both crucial aspects when it comes time for students later on down the line when looking for internships, jobs etcetera. Furthermore, teaching styles must engage learners by promoting active participation within classes through activities such as discussions rather than simply lecturing at them continuously throughout lesson periods; this helps keep people interested and attentive during class periods versus feeling like they are being talked at instead of taught anything useful (i.e memorizing facts merely out boredom). . . . Finally yet importantly: assessments! Tests may seem stressful but they do have their place in making sure that all learners retain information properly after lessons have ended with certain topics covered over time - exams help determine if someone truly understands said concept(s) so further review should not be necessary before

"Electronic cards have been around for some time now, and many people think they are a more environmentally friendly option than paper cards. Electronic cards are typically less expensive to produce and can be used in a number of ways, such as for online transactions or to track purchases. They also allow for a more personal and unique experience when receiving greetings from friends and family.

Some people think that electronic cards do not have the same flavor of paper cards. They may be more challenging to maintain, as cards can be damaged or lost easily. Additionally, some people may find electronic cards less personal because they do not have the feeling of being in person. However, overall, electronic cards seem to be a more environmentally friendly option than paper cards.

Implementing a program in a high school that allows students to complete their course classes ahead of the regular schedule could be a great benefit to students. This program could help students prepare for college by giving them the opportunity to become familiar with the college setting and academic expectations. It could also give students more time to spend with their families and explore interests outside of school. And further, it could give students extra time to work, which could help them learn the importance of hard work and build valuable experiences, such as financial responsibility, for their futures. 

Hard work is a key factor to success, and a program like this could be a blessing in teaching students this concept. It could allow students to understand the long-term rewards of putting in the effort for short-term goals. Learning to prioritize responsibilities and balance academic and personal passions is something that can aid students throughout their lives.  With the implementation of this program, a high school could provide these valuable life lessons to their students, helping them to reach their goals and create rewarding futures.",1
"Seeking multiple opinions when making an important decision or asking for advice is often a wise idea. By talking to more than one person about an issue, you are able to get different perspectives on the situation and reduce the chances of making a poor choice based on limited information. 

Each individual you speak with brings a unique set of experiences, knowledge, and point of view. What seems like an obvious solution to one person may not address other important factors that another person may recognize. Multiple people are also less likely to miss important considerations or have blind spots affecting their judgment in the same way. By pooling input from various sources, you gain a more well-rounded understanding of the options available and things to weigh in your decision making.

More opinions also allow you to identify consensus views or common advice being offered. If most people are cautioning against a particular course of action or stressed a certain decision element, that input is worthwhile taking seriously. On the other hand, conflicting or varied input could point out areas needing further research or clarification before committing to any choice. Differences in opinion highlight complexities or unknowns to better inform your final decision. 

Practical examples where multiple opinions served me well include choosing college majors, taking jobs with career implications, or resolving interpersonal issues. Balancing advice from parents, professors, mentors, and peers exposed me to more complete pictures when tackling challenging life transitions or problems. In each case, prudently considering a variety of counsel helped direct me towards choices that aligned with my goals and values.

In summary, seeking the perspectives of multiple trusted advisors is an effective strategy because it exposes you to a range of insights, helps achieve consensus, and reduces risks of missing something important due to any individual's limitations. A balanced synthesis of various viewpoints can yield wiser decisions than the recommendations of any one person alone.",1
"The debate over whether famous people should be given more privacy or not is a complex one. On one hand, famous people are often subjected to intense media scrutiny, which can be intrusive and damaging to their personal lives. On the other hand, it is often argued that this is the price of fame, and that famous people should accept it as part of the job. In my opinion, famous people should be given more privacy, as their lives should not be subject to public scrutiny.

Firstly, it is important to recognize that famous people are, above all, human beings. They have the same right to privacy as anyone else, and should not have to endure the constant scrutiny of the media. This can be particularly damaging for those who are not used to being in the public eye, as they may not be able to cope with the intense scrutiny. Furthermore, the media often sensationalizes stories about famous people, which can lead to unfair and damaging portrayals of them.

Secondly, it is important to remember that famous people are often in the public eye due to their talent and hard work. They should be celebrated and respected for their achievements, rather than subjected to intrusive media coverage. It is unfair to expect them to accept this kind of scrutiny as the price of fame, as it can be damaging to their mental health and wellbeing.

Finally, it is important to recognize that famous people can use their platform to raise awareness of important causes, and to inspire others to follow their dreams. This can be difficult to do if they are constantly subjected to media scrutiny, as it can limit their ability to speak out on important issues.

In conclusion, I believe that famous people should be given more privacy, as their lives should not be subject to public scrutiny. They are human beings, and should be respected for their achievements, rather than subjected to intrusive media coverage. This would allow them to continue to use their platform to raise awareness of important causes, and to inspire others to follow their dreams.

"There are a few different opinions on what the main purpose of a university education is. Some people believe that the purpose is to prepare students for employment, while others believe that the main purpose is to provide students with a well-rounded education that will allow them to be successful in any field they choose to pursue. I believe that the main purpose of a university education is to provide students with a well-rounded education.

While it is true that a university education can prepare students for employment, I believe that this is not it's main purpose. A university education provides students with the opportunity to learn about a variety of subjects, including history, mathematics, science, and literature. It also allows students to develop critical thinking skills and to learn how to research and analyze information. These skills are important in any field, and they can be used to help students be successful in any career they choose to pursue.

In addition, a university education can also help students to develop important personal skills, such as communication and teamwork skills. These skills are important in the workplace, but they are also important in everyday life. A university education can also help students to develop a sense of independence and to become more responsible.

All of these things are important, and they cannot be learned in a high school or vocational school. I believe that a university education is the best way to prepare students for a successful future.

"I generally agree that work today is more stressful than in the past. There are many reasons for this, but one of the main reasons is that work has become more complex. In the past, most people worked in one centralized location, and tasks were largely standardized. Nowadays, work is often scattered around various locations and tasks can be very different from one person to the next. This can make it difficult to get a sense of balance and feel like you're actually enjoying your work.

Another reason work is more stressful today is that we are now constantly multitasking. Back in the day, most people only had to worry about one task at a time. Today, however, we are constantly switching between different tasks and often have to keep up with multiple deadlines. This can be very difficult and lead to feelings of stress and anxiety.

Finally, there is the issue of burnout. Today's workers are often pushed to their limits and are required to put in long hours without any downtime. This can lead to feelings of exhaustion and frustration, which in turn can lead to stress and anxiety.

"Nowadays, computer games are very popular among children and teenagers. They play them at home, in school, in internet cafes. Some people think that computer games have produced more negative effects than positive ones on children's physical, intellectual as well as psychological development. Therefore, they suggest that effective measures should be taken to prevent children from playing them. I agree with this opinion to some extent.

On the one hand, computer games have some disadvantages. First of all, they can have a bad effect on children's health. For example, if children spend a lot of time sitting in front of the computer, they can have problems with their eyesight. Secondly, computer games can make children more aggressive. They can start to think that it is normal to resolve problems with the help of violence. Thirdly, computer games can make children less social. They can start to spend less time with their friends and family and more time alone, playing computer games.

On the other hand, computer games have some advantages. First of all, they can help children develop their logical thinking. Secondly, computer games can help children learn new information. For example, they can learn about different countries and cultures. Thirdly, computer games can help children relax and have fun.

In conclusion, I would say that computer games have both positive and negative effects on children. However, I think that the negative effects are more important than the positive ones. Therefore, I believe that effective measures should be taken to prevent children from playing computer games.

"It is often said that mistakes are essential to discovery and progress. While it is true that mistakes can sometimes lead to great inventions and advances, it is also important to note that mistakes are not always necessary in order to make progress.

The idea that mistakes are essential to discovery and progress is rooted in the concept of trial and error. By making mistakes, people can gain insights that may not be apparent when initially attempting a task or activity. For example, Thomas Edison is said to have discovered the light bulb after making numerous attempts, each of which ended in a failed experiment. This process of trial and error allowed Edison to eventually find the right combination of materials that would eventually become the modern light bulb. In this case, the mistakes that Edison made were integral to his progress and the ultimate discovery of the light bulb.

However, it is important to note that mistakes are not always necessary in order to make progress. In many cases, progress can be made without the need for mistakes. For example, advancements in technology have been made without requiring any mistakes to be made. Instead, these advancements were made through careful research and development. In this case, mistakes would have actually been detrimental to the progress as they could have set back research and development efforts.

Additionally, progress can also be made through careful planning and execution. Rather than relying on trial and error, progress can be made by carefully considering possible options and selecting the best one. This is often the case in business, where mistakes can be costly and, thus, a more cautious approach is often taken. By taking a measured approach, progress can still be made without the need for mistakes.

In conclusion, it is true that mistakes can sometimes be essential to discovery and progress. However, it is also important to note that progress can still be made without the need for mistakes. By carefully researching and planning, progress can be made without the risk of costly mistakes.

Spending time outdoors is an important part of life, for family and for oneself. There are many enjoyable activities that can bring joy, stimulation, and relaxation if done outside. Zoos, Disney parks, and travelling to different states or countries are exciting ways to get outdoors and explore the world. 

Going to a zoo can be an enjoyable experience, especially when one can get up close to animals that wouldn't otherwise be accessible. Disney parks can also be a great place to get outside and explore thrilling rides, delicious food, and unique characters.

"Most people would agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. After all, understanding ideas and concepts allows students to apply what they learn to new situations, whereas learning facts can be useful but ultimately does not allow for as much creativity or flexibility.

One way to understand why understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts is to consider the example of history. If students learn only the facts, they may be able to answer a test question correctly, but they will not be able to understand the larger implications of what they are learning. For example, if students learn about the American Revolution, they will understand that the colonies revolted against the British, but they will not be able to understand the reasons why the Revolution happened or the impact it had on the world. However, if students understand the ideas and concepts behind the Revolution, they will be able to understand these larger implications.

In addition to allowing students to understand history better, understanding ideas and concepts also allows students to apply what they learn in other subjects to new situations. For example, if students learn about fractions in math class, they will be able to apply what they learn to real-life situations, such as dividing a pizza evenly among four people. However, if students only learn the facts about fractions, they will not be able to do this.

Ultimately, then, understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts. This is because understanding ideas and concepts allows students to be more creative and flexible in their thinking, and it allows them to apply what they learn in other subjects to new situations.

"The advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and can greatly benefit individuals and society as a whole. This concept is becoming increasingly popular around the world, as seen in examples like the German suburb of Vauban, the driving bans in Paris, and the car-free day in Bogota. By reducing car usage, we can decrease greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, reduce traffic congestion, and create more sustainable and livable communities.

One of the most significant advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major contributor to these emissions, especially in car-intensive areas. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, while in some areas of the United States, they account for up to 50 percent. By relying less on cars, we can decrease our carbon footprint and combat climate change.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can greatly improve air quality, as demonstrated by the driving bans in Paris. Smog and pollution from cars can have a detrimental impact on human health, causing respiratory problems and other illnesses. By implementing measures to reduce car usage, we can decrease these health risks and create cleaner and healthier environments.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in traffic congestion. With fewer cars on the road, traffic flow can improve, leading to shorter commute times and less frustration for commuters. This is especially evident in car-free communities like Vauban, where residents have embraced alternative forms of transportation such as walking, biking, and public transit. By providing better infrastructure and accessibility to these modes of transportation, we can encourage people to leave their cars at home and avoid the gridlock that plagues many cities.

In addition, limiting car usage can lead to the development of more sustainable and livable communities. By adopting the principles of smart planning, as seen in Vauban, we can create neighborhoods that prioritize pedestrians, cyclists, and public transportation rather than cars. Stores placed within walking distance, rather than in distant malls, promote a sense of community and reduce the need for excessive car usage. This approach not only enhances the quality of life for residents but also reduces the dependence on cars, making these communities more environmentally friendly.

Overall, the advantages of limiting car usage are clear. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, reducing traffic congestion, and creating sustainable communities, we can mitigate the negative impact of cars and move towards a more environmentally friendly and socially responsible future. It is essential for individuals, communities, and governments to embrace the advantages of limiting car usage and work together to create a more sustainable and livable world.",1
"The Importance of Retaining the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College intact for the election of the President of the United States. While there are arguments in favor of changing to a popular vote system, I believe the Electoral College provides several crucial benefits that outweigh the perceived disadvantages.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome. In the event of a dispute over the election results, the Electoral College method reduces the likelihood of prolonged legal battles. As stated in ""In Defense of the Electoral College"" by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College tends to exceed their share of the popular vote, creating a clear and decisive result. This system avoids uncertainty and helps maintain stability in our democratic process.

Secondly, the Electoral College encourages candidates to have trans-regional appeal. As outlined in Judge Posner's article, no single region in the United States has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This motivates candidates to campaign on a national scale, listening to the concerns and interests of citizens across the country. This approach ensures that the elected president represents the diverse needs of all Americans, rather than being limited to regional interests.

Thirdly, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes in swing states promotes engagement and participation in the political process. As mentioned in Judge Posner's article, these swing states become the focus of campaign efforts, and voters in these states are more likely to pay close attention to the candidates and the issues. This system encourages thoughtful voting and ensures that the most engaged citizens have a significant role in deciding the outcome.

Moreover, the Electoral College restores balance by granting more weight to larger states. As described by Judge Posner, the mal-apportionment of the Senate favors smaller states, and the Electoral College provides a mechanism to offset this disparity. This ensures that presidential candidates consider the concerns and needs of citizens in both large and small states, preventing any imbalance of representation.

Lastly, by maintaining the Electoral College, we avoid the complex logistics of run-off elections. Elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote can lead to run-off contests, which could further complicate the presidential election process. The Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner, minimizing any need for run-off elections and ensuring a smooth transition of power.

While there are critics who argue that the winner-take-all system of the Electoral College can lead to the disenfranchisement of voters in non-swing states, it is important to note that voter turnouts remain high, as mentioned in Judge Posner's article. The Electoral College does not deter individuals from participating in the election; rather, it allows voters to express their political preferences and helps maintain the integrity of the process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College provides certainty, encourages national appeal, promotes engagement, restores balance, and avoids run-off elections. These benefits outweigh the arguments for a popular vote system. Let us continue to uphold the Electoral College as a vital component of our democratic process.

Thank you for considering my viewpoint. I hope that you will take these factors into account when making decisions regarding the future of the Electoral College.

Sincerely,

Proponents of a curfew for teenagers in our city argue that it can help to reduce crime and delinquency. By diminishing the amount of time minors spend in public spaces, it can potentially reduce the risk of harm coming to them or of them becoming involved in illegal activities. Moreover, a curfew can provide parents with peace of mind in knowing that their children are at home and safe. 

On the other hand, opponents of the curfew policy argue that it may be too restrictive and not take into account extenuating circumstances. Additionally, there is concern that it may have a disproportionate impact on certain demographics, such as low-income and minority groups.

Overall, while I understand and consider both the points of supporters and detractors of the curfew policy, I believe that the adoption of a curfew has its merits. By enforcing sensible regulations which are designed to ensure the safety of minors, we can collectively help to curb both delinquency and crime.",1

Limiting car usage can have significant advantages for individuals and communities. This is evident from the examples of Vauban in Germany, Paris in France, and Bogota in Colombia, where initiatives to reduce car dependence have been successful.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the positive impact on the environment. Greenhouse gas emissions from cars contribute significantly to climate change. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, while in some areas of the United States, the figure can go up to 50 percent. By reducing the number of cars on the road, emissions can be greatly reduced, leading to cleaner and healthier air for everyone. This is particularly important in densely populated areas like cities, where the concentration of cars is high.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement in quality of life for individuals. In Vauban, where 70 percent of families do not own cars, residents report being happier and less stressed since giving up their cars. They enjoy walking and cycling in car-free streets, where there is less noise and pollution. Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to increased physical activity, as people are more likely to walk or cycle for shorter trips, improving their overall health and well-being.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can provide economic benefits. In Paris, a partial driving ban was enforced due to smog, resulting in a 60 percent decrease in congestion. This shows that reducing the number of cars on the road can lead to smoother traffic flow and less time wasted in traffic jams. In turn, this can boost productivity and stimulate economic growth. Additionally, by promoting alternative modes of transportation such as public transit and cycling, cities can reduce the need for expensive road infrastructure and parking spaces, saving money in the long run.

Finally, limiting car usage can promote social cohesion and community engagement. In Bogota, the car-free day encourages millions of people to use alternative modes of transportation, such as buses, bikes, or walking. This creates a sense of unity and shared experience among residents, as they witness empty streets devoid of traffic jams. It also promotes a healthier and more active lifestyle, as people are encouraged to engage in physical activities instead of relying solely on cars for transportation.

In conclusion, there are numerous advantages to limiting car usage. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality to enhancing quality of life, promoting economic benefits, and fostering social cohesion, limiting car usage can have a positive impact on individuals and communities. Initiatives like those seen in Vauban, Paris, and Bogota provide valuable examples of how reducing car dependence can lead to a better and more sustainable future.",1
"In today's fast-paced world, young people often find themselves caught up in their own lives, with little time to spare for others. While this may be true to a certain extent, I do not entirely agree that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. In fact, many young people are actively engaged in community service and volunteer work, making a positive impact on society. 

Firstly, many young people participate in community service programs offered by schools or other organizations. For example, some schools require students to complete a certain number of community service hours before graduation. This gives young people an opportunity to give back to their communities while also gaining valuable skills and experiences. Additionally, many organizations, such as Habitat for Humanity or the Red Cross, offer volunteer opportunities for young people to get involved in causes they care about. 

Secondly, social media has made it easier for young people to raise awareness about social issues and mobilize their peers to take action. We often hear about young activists who have used social media platforms to organize protests or start campaigns to address issues such as climate change, gun violence, or racial inequality. Social media has enabled these young people to connect with like-minded individuals and amplify their message to a wider audience. 

Moreover, even those young people who may not be actively involved in community service still make a difference in their communities by supporting local businesses, participating in local events, or simply being good neighbors. These small acts of kindness and support are often overlooked but can have a significant impact on building strong, resilient communities. 

However, it is true that some young people may not prioritize community service due to other obligations or simply being unaware of the opportunities available to them. In such cases, it is important for schools, parents, and community organizations to actively promote and encourage volunteer work among young people. This could be done through programs that offer incentives or recognition for community service, or by providing resources and information about volunteer opportunities. 

In conclusion, while some young people may not give enough time to helping their communities, there are many who are actively engaged in volunteer work and community service. Social media and other platforms have also made it easier for young people to raise awareness about social issues and mobilize their peers to take action. Ultimately, it is important to recognize and encourage the efforts of young people who are making a positive impact on their communities, while also finding ways to engage those who may not be as involved.

"Nowadays, more and more students, especially English majors, begin to use an electronic dictionary instead of a dictionary. This is a good thing, but it'should not be the only way of learning the English language.

In the past, students used to write their essays on paper and then send them to a teacher for correction. The teacher would then write a correction on the back of the paper, and the student would send it back to him or her. In this way, the students were able to improve their writing skills by correcting their own mistakes. Today, however, most students do not have the time or the inclination to do this. Instead, they rely on their electronic devices to correct their errors. Therefore, it is important for students to learn how to read and write in English without relying on a computer.

Excerpt: Our impressions of those around us can have a powerful impact on our lives. Oftentimes our impressions of other people can be swayed by our own thoughts and feelings. It is important to understand how our thoughts and feelings may lead us to form impressions of people that are not always accurate. In order to control our impressions, there are certain strategies we can employ. We can explore different expressions, attitudes, and emotions of people to help us form a more clear impression. Additionally, we can look to our parents as an influence when it comes to forming impressions of those around us. Finally, it is important to remember that nothing is impossible when it comes to changing our impressions. With the right strategies, we can learn to form deeper, more meaningful impressions, and ultimately better relationships with those around us.",1
"As the world becomes more complex and interconnected, the importance of having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is becoming increasingly clear. While specialization in one specific subject can be valuable in certain circumstances, I believe that a well-rounded education is more beneficial in the long run. In this essay, I will explain why I think this is the case, using specific reasons and examples to support my argument.

Firstly, having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects allows individuals to be more adaptable and versatile in their careers. In today's rapidly changing job market, it is becoming increasingly important to be able to pivot and adapt to new challenges and opportunities. This requires a diverse skill set and a broad understanding of different fields. For example, a business executive who has a background in both finance and marketing is likely to be more successful than one who only has expertise in one of these areas. Similarly, a software engineer who has a solid understanding of both computer science and mathematics is likely to be more effective than one who only specializes in one of these subjects.

Secondly, a broad education can help individuals to develop critical thinking skills and a more holistic perspective on the world. By studying a range of subjects, individuals are exposed to different ways of thinking and different approaches to problem-solving. This can help to foster creativity and innovation, as well as a more nuanced understanding of complex issues. For example, a student who studies both history and economics is likely to have a better understanding of how economic policies have evolved over time, and how they have impacted different societies and cultures.

Finally, a broad education can help individuals to become more well-rounded and fulfilled human beings. By studying a range of subjects, individuals are exposed to different cultures, perspectives, and ways of life. This can help to broaden their horizons and deepen their understanding of the world around them. For example, a student who studies both literature and anthropology is likely to have a better appreciation for the diversity of human experience, and a greater empathy for people from different backgrounds.

Of course, there are some situations in which specialization in one specific subject is necessary or desirable. For example, doctors and engineers need to have a deep understanding of their respective fields in order to be effective in their jobs. However, even in these cases, a broad education can be valuable. Doctors who have a background in both medicine and psychology, for example, are likely to be more effective at treating patients with mental health issues. Engineers who have a background in both mechanical engineering and environmental science are likely to be more effective at designing sustainable infrastructure.

In conclusion, while specialization in one specific subject can be valuable in certain circumstances, I believe that a broad education is more beneficial in the long run. By having a diverse skill set, a holistic perspective, and a well-rounded understanding of the world, individuals are better equipped to navigate the complexities of modern life and to make meaningful contributions to society.

"Advertisements are ubiquitous in our daily lives. Whether we are watching TV, scrolling through social media, or walking down the street, we are bombarded with images of products and services that promise to improve our lives in some way. However, it is often the case that these advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. In this essay, I will argue that I agree with this statement, and I will provide specific reasons and examples to support my position.

Firstly, advertisements often rely on exaggeration and hyperbole to sell products. Advertisers know that consumers are more likely to be attracted to products that seem extraordinary or exceptional in some way. This is why we see so many advertisements that make grandiose claims about their products, such as ""the best moisturizer in the world"" or ""the most delicious chocolate you'll ever taste."" However, in reality, these claims are often unfounded or exaggerated. For example, a moisturizer may be effective, but it is unlikely to be the best in the world. Similarly, chocolate may be delicious, but it is unlikely to be the most delicious in the world.

Secondly, advertisements often use selective editing and framing to create a positive image of products. Advertisers know that consumers are more likely to be attracted to products that are presented in a positive light. This is why we often see advertisements that show happy, attractive people enjoying their products, or that use bright, colorful imagery to create a sense of excitement and joy. However, these images are often carefully crafted to create a specific impression of the product. For example, an advertisement for a fast food chain may show happy families enjoying their meals, but it is unlikely to show the negative health effects of eating fast food on a regular basis.

Finally, advertisements often use psychological tricks to manipulate consumers into buying products. Advertisers know that consumers are more likely to buy products that they feel an emotional connection to. This is why we often see advertisements that use sentimental or heartwarming images to create a sense of emotional attachment to products. For example, an advertisement for a car may show a father and son bonding over a road trip, creating a sense of nostalgia and family connection that is designed to make consumers feel more attached to the car.

In conclusion, I believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Advertisers use a variety of techniques to create a positive image of their products, including exaggeration, selective editing, and psychological manipulation. As consumers, it is important to be aware of these techniques and to approach advertisements with a critical eye. By doing so, we can make more informed decisions about the products we buy and avoid being misled by deceptive advertising.

Success can be a difficult concept to define, and even more difficult to achieve. While some argue that it is only through the experience of numerous failures that success can be achieved, others assert that success can be achieved even without the hardships of numerous failures. 

Those who argue that success depends on failure cite the fact that failure gives opportunity for growth and insight. With each failure, we come to understand the shortcomings of our plans and can make improvements to find ultimate success. Thomas Edison famously said, “I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.” This exemplifies how failure can aid us on our path to success.

On the other hand, some people believe that success can be obtained without failure, and point to examples of those who found success without making any serious mistakes. They argue that success can be achieved with hard work, dedication, and perhaps a little luck.

In my opinion, true success is a combination of both failure and success. Without failure, a person may not gain the necessary experience and setback needed to recognize what steps need to be taken in order to succeed. On the other hand, sheer hard work and dedication can help to guide us in the right direction and offer support for our efforts to reach success.",1
"The topic of my essay is the positive effect technology has had on communication in the workplace. Since its introduction, technology has made an undeniable impact on society and changed the way we communicate with one another. In recent years it has revolutionized communication in the workplace by providing a range of effective tools for teams to collaborate remotely and streamline their workflow. From instant messaging platforms to video conferencing tools, these technologies are allowing businesses to break down geographical boundaries and build relationships with colleagues across vast distances. For starters, cloud-based file sharing services such as Google Drive have been instrumental in allowing remote employees to share documents quickly and easily while maintaining secure access control protocols. This makes it possible for geographically dispersed teams to stay up-to-date on projects at all times without having to worry about emailing large files or losing important information due to security breaches or miscommunication. Additionally, team collaboration software like Slack enables organizations to keep multiple conversations organized into separate channels so that members can stay focused on specific topics without distraction or clutter from other discussions within the company chatroom. Furthermore, modern video conferencing solutions like Zoom provide companies with an easy way for teammates from different locations around world come together virtually via visual means instead of relying solely on phone calls or emails when discussing assignments among each other. This allows colleagues from any location have face-to-face interactions regardless if they’re sitting side by side in office setting or miles apart working remotely—which helps boost morale and foster stronger professional connections over long distances even if workers aren’t able physically meet up often enough due travel restrictions or limited resources/budget constraints preventing them from meeting frequently in person rather than online interfaces. . By leveraging these technological advancements, businesses can now operate more efficiently than ever before by breaking through language barriers between coworkers free of charge while also eliminating many logistical hurdles previously associated with remote collaboration thanks features that allow users host virtual meetings anywhere anytime quickly set up conference rooms (

A positive attitude is a powerful tool that can have far reaching effects on one's life and can even have a positive impact on the world around them. Having a positive attitude in the workplace can benefit both co-workers and employers. A positive attitude can improve productivity, create a positive work environment, and even influence the motivation levels of other employees. Its effects on daily life are far-reaching and can have profound impacts on self-esteem, communication, relationships, decision-making, and mental health. Respect is an integral part of having a positive attitude, and those who cultivate feelings of respect for those around them are often seen as happier and more successful.

When comparing and contrasting the effects of a positive attitude against a negative attitude, one must consider how these two attitudes can affect a person's ability to think, act, and succeed. Generally speaking, having a positive attitude can lead to a greater feeling of accomplishment, better physical and mental health, enhanced social relationships, and improved decision-making abilities. On the other hand, a negative attitude can lead to feelings of depression, low self-esteem, unhealthy relationships, and a lack of ambition.

When faced with the choice to have a positive or negative attitude, it can be argued that having a positive attitude is the most beneficial route to take. Positive attitudes can help shape a more successful life, and in turn, a more successful world. Therefore, it is completely worth the effort to strive for and maintain a positive attitude.",1
"The debate on whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate has been ongoing for some time. While there are merits to both approaches, I believe that children should be taught to cooperate.

Cooperation is a key life skill and one that will serve children well in the future. It is an important tool in developing relationships, problem solving, and working together to achieve a common goal. Cooperation helps children learn to listen to and respect the opinions of others, to compromise, and to empathize with those around them. It encourages teamwork and collaboration, which are important skills for success in the workplace. It also teaches children to be more tolerant and understanding of others and their differences.

Competition, on the other hand, can lead to feelings of frustration and inadequacy, as not everyone can come out on top. It can also lead to a sense of superiority, as children who come out on top may feel that they are better than those who do not. This can be damaging to their self-esteem and to their relationships with others.

In my opinion, cooperation should be the focus when teaching children. This does not mean that competition should be completely avoided. Rather, it'should be used in a constructive way, such as encouraging children to work together to reach a common goal. For example, a group of children could be given a task and asked to work together to complete it in the best way possible. This would allow them to learn the important skills of cooperation while still providing a sense of accomplishment.

In conclusion, I believe that children should be taught to cooperate rather than compete. Cooperation is an important life skill that will help them develop strong relationships, problem-solving skills, and a sense of empathy. Competition can be used in a constructive way, but it'should not be the primary focus when teaching children.

"I agree that the most essential quality of an effective leader is the ability to remain consistently committed to particular principles and objectives. Leaders who are able to remain steadfastly committed to a particular course of action, regardless of popular opinion, are the ones who are able to bring about real and lasting change. This commitment is essential for any leader who wishes to be successful.

In order to be an effective leader, one must understand that their job is not to simply follow the whims of popular opinion. While it is important to consider the opinions of the public, leaders should strive to stay true to their own convictions and principles. To truly lead, a person must be willing to take risks and to stand by their decisions despite the potential for criticism.

A great example of this is former President Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln was adamant in his commitment to ending slavery in the United States, despite the fact that a majority of Americans did not agree with him. Many people criticized Lincoln’s decision and even labeled him a “dictator” for his refusal to compromise on the issue. Yet, Lincoln remained steadfast and was eventually able to deliver on his promise to abolish slavery.

Another example of an effective leader who stayed committed to their principles is Mahatma Gandhi. He was a firm believer in non-violence and was often met with strong opposition for his refusal to use violence to resolve conflicts. Despite the opposition and the possibility of failure, Gandhi remained committed to his principles and was able to bring about real change in India.

In both of these examples, the leaders remained committed to their principles despite the possibility of failure and popular opposition. This is what sets effective leaders apart from those who are easily swayed by popular opinion. A leader who is consistently committed to their principles and objectives is able to bring about real and lasting change, whereas those who are easily swayed by the opinion of the public may find themselves unable to accomplish much of anything.

In conclusion, I believe that the most essential quality of an effective leader is the ability to remain consistently committed to particular principles and objectives. Leaders who are able to stay true to their convictions and refuse to be influenced by popular opinion are the ones who can bring about real and lasting change. Both Abraham Lincoln and Mahatma Gandhi are prime examples of leaders who stayed true to their principles and were ultimately successful in their endeavors.

Our character is not simply predetermined by factors beyond our control; instead, it is the result of a combination of both our own choices and influences from beyond our control. For instance, we may be born into a particular set of family circumstances that shape our decisions and beliefs, and these can have a strong impact on our behavior and attitude. At the same time, we have the capacity to choose our own path and shape our own character through a combination of self-determination and free will.

"  A Sustainable Vision for Urban Development  In an age characterized by rapid urbanization and mounting environmental concerns, the concept of car-free cities has emerged as an innovative approach to address the complex challenges of modern urban life. These cities propose a fundamental shift in urban planning, where private automobiles are either heavily restricted or entirely absent, making room for sustainable transportation alternatives and a greener, more vibrant urban environment.  Car-free cities represent a visionary perspective on urban living, focusing on sustainability, public health, and community well-being. They offer a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment, though this transition is not without its unique set of challenges.  One of the central benefits of car-free cities is their potential to significantly reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. By prioritizing pedestrian and cyclist safety, these cities aim to reduce accidents and improve public health, contributing to better respiratory and cardiovascular well-being for urban residents. Moreover, car-free cities make efficient use of urban space, converting parking lots and wide roads into green parks, recreational areas, and pedestrian zones. This transformation rejuvenates the urban landscape, enhancing the overall quality of life for city residents. Reduced reliance on private cars results in decreased traffic congestion, shorter commute times, and reduced stress levels for urban inhabitants. Additionally, car ownership can be a significant financial burden, and by relying less on private vehicles, residents have the opportunity to save money on car-related expenses, improving their financial stability.  However, transitioning to car-free cities is not without its unique set of challenges. Many individuals heavily rely on their cars for daily activities and commutes, which can result in resistance to the transition due to concerns about inconvenience and a perceived loss of personal freedom. Effective public transportation is essential for the success of car-free cities, and substantial investments are required to expand and enhance public transit systems, providing convenient alternatives to private cars. Businesses that depend on car-dependent customers may experience declining revenues during the transition, necessitating solutions to mitigate the economic impact. The process of reconfiguring urban areas for car-free living is complex and time-consuming, requiring comprehensive planning and substantial investments in infrastructure.  To successfully implement car-free cities, solutions include expanding and improving public transportation, promoting active transportation methods such as walking and cycling, encouraging carpooling and ride-sharing, adopting electric and sustainable transportation options, and focusing on public education and awareness.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer a visionary perspective on more sustainable, healthier, and community-centric urban living. Despite the challenges, the potential benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, public health, efficient urban living, and cost savings make them a compelling goal. By investing in public transportation, promoting alternative transportation methods, and engaging the public in the planning process, cities can work toward a future where private cars are no longer the dominant mode of transportation. Car-free cities represent a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment.",1
"Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. I agree with this statement for a few reasons. First, advertisements are designed to be eye-catching and memorable. They use techniques such as bright colors, attractive people, and catchy music to grab our attention and make us want to buy the product. Second, advertisements often exaggerate the benefits of the product. They may show the product being used in a way that is not realistic, or they may make claims that are not supported by evidence. Finally, many advertisements target our emotions, playing on our fears or desires in order to get us to buy the product.

All of these factors combine to create an inaccurate picture of the products being advertised. We may end up buying something that we don't really need, or that doesn't work as well as we thought it would. In some cases, we may even be misled into buying a dangerous product. For these reasons, I believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.

Dear Senator [Last Name],

As a high school student studying American government, I feel compelled to express my thoughts on the upcoming presidential election and the role of the Electoral College in determining the winner. As an individual, I believe that the Electoral College serves an important purpose in our democracy, and I am writing to urge you to support maintaining the Electoral College system.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures that presidential elections remain fair and representative across all states, regardless of each state's population. Without the Electoral College system, candidates would only campaign in highly populated states, ignoring the smaller states and their issues. In this way, the Electoral College promotes fairness, as it gives equal weight to each state's electoral votes, regardless of their population size.

Additionally, the Electoral College prevents the tyranny of the majority by requiring a candidate to win a broad majority of states to become president. It is a critical safeguard against a candidate winning the popular vote while ignoring the needs of smaller states or specific regions. This way, the system ensures that the winning candidate is representative of the entire country, not just a few states.

Furthermore, the current system ensures that the President-elect has won a clear mandate to govern. If the President-elect had only won the popular vote by a small percentage, as has happened in the past, they would not be able to govern effectively, as they would not have a clear mandate from the voters.

In conclusion, the Electoral College serves many important purposes that cannot be overlooked. It promotes fairness, prevents the tyranny of the majority, and ensures that the President-elect has won a mandate to govern effectively. I urge you, therefore, to support maintaining this system.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"Sports have always been a great way to bring people together and promote physical activity. Basketball is a particularly popular sport that has gained countless fans in recent years, making it one of the world's favorite pastimes. From its grassroots beginnings on city playgrounds to full-fledged professional leagues, basketball continues to captivate audiences with its fast pace and dynamic play. Basketball originated in Springfield, Massachusetts in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith as an indoor winter game for the YMCA gym class he taught there. He created 13 simple rules for the game which included two peach baskets hung at opposite ends of a court as goals and teams composed of five players on each side who could only move while dribbling or passing the ball between them. Since then, these basic rules have remained largely unchanged even though improvements have been made over time such as larger courts with three point lines and better equipment like regulation hoops and higher quality balls that look nothing like those original peaches baskets!. The popularity of basketball has grown exponentially since its inception over 100 years ago; today there are 3 million youth participants worldwide playing in organized leagues helping foster sportsmanship among young adults while providing them with an opportunity to stay active indoors during cold weather months. In addition, professional leagues such as the NBA attract millions more spectators every year from all corners of the globe watching their favorite teams compete against one another for championships season after season each summertime - this is what makes basketball so special because despite any language barriers or cultural differences everyone can still appreciate some good old friendly competition!. Whether you're just shooting around solo at your local park or competing head-to-head against friends on the court, basketball will always be fun to both watch and play no matter how long it's been around for us humans to enjoy!

"Limited car usage can provide significant benefits for communities and the environment. According to multiple sources, reducing reliance on personal vehicles can help address serious issues like pollution, traffic congestion, and climate change.

Air pollution from traffic emissions poses major health risks. As Passage 1 notes, vehicles are a leading source of particulate matter and nitrogen oxides which contribute to respiratory illnesses. Limiting personal car trips would decrease these harmful pollutants released into the atmosphere. Public transit produces significantly fewer emissions per passenger than private cars. Transitioning some drivers to buses or trains could thus help cities attain cleaner air.  

Traffic congestion not only wastes people's time but also fuel as cars sit idling. Passage 2 refers to how a growing number of vehicles has led to more time stuck in congestion. If a portion of commuters shifted to alternative modes of transport like cycling, walking or public transit, there would be fewer cars competing for road space during peak hours. This could reduce vehicular bottlenecks and free up traffic flow. With less congestion, fuel costs from idling would also decline, providing an economic benefit.

Additionally, restricting car usage would lower greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector according to Passage 3. As one of the fastest growing sources of climate pollution, curbing automobile dependence can make an impact in mitigating the carbon footprint. Low-emission public transit, walking and cycling can replace short-distance car trips which significantly damage the environment. Transitioning to more sustainable modes will support efforts to curb global warming for future generations. 

In summary, limiting car usage through promotion of public transit and active mobility brings multiple advantages by reducing air and noise pollution, traffic congestion, and emissions responsible for the climate crisis. A balanced multi-modal transportation system with fewer personal vehicles can offer communities cleaner air and a more efficient movement of people and goods.",1
"The so-called ""Face on Mars"" is simply a natural landform, not evidence of alien visitation. While the vague facial features captured in early NASA photos sparked intriguing speculation, further study has clearly shown the formation to be a product of geology, not intelligence. 

Some key pieces of evidence support this. First, when viewed at higher resolution by later NASA missions, the hills and shadows that gave the impression of eyes, nose and mouth from a distance were revealed to be merely random cracks and slopes conforming to the surrounding terrain. Their accidental resemblance to facial features was clearly an optical illusion rather than intentional design. 

Second, the composition of the region, primarily made of rocks like sandstone and basalt that are known to erode into odd polygonal plateaus and mesas, provides a perfectly reasonable geological explanation for the landform's shape. Places on Earth with similar rocks, like the American Southwest, exhibit myriad landscapes sculpted by natural forces into uncanny and vaguely symbolic appearances. The idea that planetary processes could not account for this one Martian feature requires a leap of faith absent geological proof.

Finally, no other artifacts or evidence of civilization have ever been found near the ""Face."" If it were truly an artificial construct, we would expect to find other signs of an advanced culture nearby, such as infrastructure, tools or waste. But high-resolution images show only more typical Martian panoramas of rocks and sand. The isolated nature of this single formation argues against its being anything other than a quirky confluence of natural hills. 

In conclusion, while the human tendency to seek patterns can make formations like the ""Face on Mars"" suggestive of design to some, scientific scrutiny reveals it to be simply another curious rock outcropping across the red plains, no different from countless others gradually shaped depuis time by the passive action of wind and weather on Martian terrain. Future observations of the Red Planet will surely uncover many more strange landforms, but none require alien visitation to reasonably explain their origin. The ""Face"" remains, as the article concludes, a reminder of how easily our minds can perceive the paranormal where only natural geography exists.",1

"There is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on the individual and their specific needs and goals. However, in general, I believe that speaking is more important for Chinese learners of English than reading.

There are several reasons for this. Firstly, spoken English is the most natural form of the language. It is how native speakers communicate with each other and, as such, it is the best way to learn the nuances and subtleties of the language. Secondly, spoken English is more versatile than written English. It can be used for a variety of purposes, from communicating with people face-to-face to making presentations in a business setting. Finally, spoken English is more important for practical reasons. It is essential for travelling, working and living in English-speaking countries.

That said, reading is also an important skill for Chinese learners of English. It helps to improve vocabulary and grammar, and can give a deeper understanding of the language. However, speaking is still the most important skill overall.

"This essay will analyze, discuss and prove one reason in favor of keeping the Electoral College in the United States for its presidential elections. One of the reasons to keep the electoral college is that it is better for smaller, more rural states to have more influence as opposed to larger metropolitan areas that have large populations. The electors from these states are granted two votes each. Those from larger, more populated areas are granted just one vote each. Smaller states tend to hold significant power because their two votes for president and vice president add up more than the votes of larger states that have many electors. This is because of the split of the electoral votes. Some argue that electors are not bound to vote for the candidate who won the most votes nationally. They do not have to vote for their own state's nominee unless their state has a winner take all system. However, there are states that have adopted laws that force their electors to vote for their state's candidate. It seems that, no matter how, electors are not bound to vote for the candidate who won the most nationally. This is not always the case because of state legislatures who can overrule the electors and vote for the alternative candidate their citizens have selected for them, even if the voter lives in a state without a winner take all system.",1

Subject: The Importance of Retaining the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and urge you to consider its benefits when contemplating any potential changes to the current system of electing the President of the United States.

The Electoral College was established by our founding fathers as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and a popular vote by qualified citizens. Its process involves the selection of electors, the voting by electors for President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by Congress, with a majority of 270 electoral votes required to elect the President (What Is the Electoral College?).

While critics argue that the Electoral College is unfair and undemocratic, there are several practical reasons why it should be retained. Firstly, the certainty of outcome is higher with the Electoral College. Although disputes over the outcome of an Electoral College vote are possible, they are less likely than disputes over the popular vote. Due to the winner-take-all system in each state, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote (Posner, 18).

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that the President has a trans-regional appeal. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a President, meaning candidates must appeal to a diverse range of states and regions. This results in a President who represents the interests and concerns of the entire nation, rather than just a specific region (Posner, 19).

Moreover, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus on swing states, where the outcome of the election is uncertain. This allows voters in these states to have a more direct impact on the election and encourages candidates to address the specific concerns of these states (Posner, 20).

Furthermore, the Electoral College balances the weight of large states against small states. Although the popular vote may be close in a large state, the winner receives a significant number of electoral votes, ensuring their attention and consideration for the concerns of that state. This prevents smaller states from being overlooked in the electoral process (Posner, 21).

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections in cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. This reduces the complexity and cost of the election process while still producing a clear and decisive winner (Posner, 22).

It is important to note that voter turnout is not significantly affected by the Electoral College. Despite the fact that individual votes may not swing a national election, approximately half of the eligible American population still participates in presidential elections (Posner, 23). Voters are driven by their desire to express their political preference rather than solely relying on the belief that their vote will decide the outcome.

In conclusion, the Electoral College has proven to be a practical and effective method for electing the President. Its retention ensures certainty of outcome, encourages trans-regional appeal, focuses attention on swing states, balances the weight of large and small states, and prevents the need for run-off elections. While improvements can always be made to any system, it is crucial to consider the experience and wisdom of our founding fathers when evaluating any potential changes to the Electoral College.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will carefully consider the importance of retaining the Electoral College for the future of our democratic nation.

"In recent years, computer games have become increasingly popular among children. While some people argue that computer games have negative effects on children, I disagree with this viewpoint. I believe that computer games can have positive effects on children's physical, intellectual, and psychological development, and that they can be enjoyed in a safe and responsible manner.

Firstly, computer games can have a positive impact on children's physical development. Many computer games require players to move their bodies, such as dance games or motion-controlled games. These types of games promote physical activity and can help children develop hand-eye coordination and motor skills. Research has shown that playing computer games can also improve reaction times, which can be beneficial for sports and other physical activities.

Secondly, computer games can help children develop their intellectual abilities. Many computer games require players to use problem-solving skills, strategic thinking, and critical reasoning. For example, puzzle games and strategy games can help children develop these skills. Research has also shown that playing computer games can improve cognitive abilities such as memory, attention, and spatial awareness.

Finally, computer games can have a positive impact on children's psychological development. Playing computer games can provide children with a sense of achievement and mastery, which can boost their self-esteem and confidence. Moreover, many computer games have social components that allow children to interact with other players and develop social skills.

Of course, it is important to ensure that children play computer games in a safe and responsible manner. Parents should monitor their children's gaming habits and set limits on the amount of time they spend playing. They should also ensure that children play appropriate games that are age-appropriate and do not contain violent or inappropriate content.

In conclusion, I disagree with the notion that computer games have produced more negative effects than positive ones on children's physical, intellectual, and psychological development. While it is important to ensure that children play games in a safe and responsible manner, computer games can have many positive effects on children's development, and can be enjoyed as a fun and educational activity.

The proliferation of technology has had far-reaching consequences on our present-day society. For one, it has had a significant negative impact on the ways in which we interact with one another as well as on the new generations. For instance, rapid advancements in technology have given rise to increasingly sophisticated online means of communication, such as social media and instant messaging. Though these have helped to bring people closer together, it has also resulted in an ever-growing lack of face-to-face interaction. As such, the means of expressing our appreciation and understanding for one another through tactile means, such as a hug or hand shake, are becoming increasingly foreign.

Furthermore, the ease with which technology has been integrated into our daily lives has come with numerous risks. By way of example, the prevalence of spam and malicious viruses on the Internet can compromise the safety of our personal information, posing a serious threat to our identity and our creditworthiness. In addition, the availability of technology means that it has become far too convenient to sit and be entertained rather than be out and active. As such, many of us have become complacent and have grown too comfortable relying on the television and video games to keep our minds occupied. 

In conclusion, the implications of technology on society have been profound. It has caused us to shy away from personal, face-to-face interaction and has enabled us to become lazy and complacent. In order to mitigate these effects, we must find more meaningful ways to socialize with one another, be cognizant of the risks posed by technology, and take full advantage of the opportunities it provides us.",1
"I hold the view that speaking is more important for Chinese learners.

What is the best way to learn Chinese? I believe that it is important to start with the basics, and then move on to more advanced topics. For example, if you want to know how to say ""hello"" in Chinese, you should start by learning the pronunciation of the word. Then, when you are ready, go to a Chinese-speaking friend and ask him or her to help you learn the correct pronunciation. This way you will be able to communicate with Chinese people in a more natural way.

"Education is an essential part of our society. It provides us with the knowledge and skills we need to be successful in life, but it also serves as a great equalizer for people from all backgrounds. Unfortunately, education often gets overlooked when discussing important societal issues, leaving many children across the United States without access to quality educational opportunities and resources. The issue of unequal access to schooling has been particularly pronounced among low-income communities in urban areas. Funding disparities between suburban and urban school districts are quite significant; on average, affluent neighborhoods receive about twice as much annual funding per student compared to their poorer counterparts (U.S Department of Education). These discrepancies lead to lower classroom sizes and fewer resources available in underfunded schools—all factors that have a direct impact on students' academic achievement levels. At its core, this problem is rooted in systemic racism and socioeconomic inequality within our society; those living in poverty are more likely than their wealthier peers to experience inadequate educational opportunities due to financial barriers that prevent them from attending better funded schools (Council On Poverty). This is why local governments must work together with private organizations like nonprofits or philanthropic foundations toward providing equitable educational experiences for everyone regardless of income level or racial background. Some strategies could include increasing public school budgets so that teachers can provide higher quality instruction and materials for each student; creating innovative programs designed specifically for underserved youth such as mentorship initiatives or career development workshops; investing more heavily into infrastructure projects such as after-school centers or libraries located near underprivileged neighborhoods; allocating increased funds towards scholarships/tuition assistance programs targeting low-income families who cannot afford tuition costs at high performing institutions; etcetera . All these efforts would help narrow the gap between wealthy students having expansive learning opportunities versus disadvantaged ones being restricted by finances — ultimately leading towards stronger futures for tomorrow’s leaders regardless of their socio-economic background!. In conclusion, tackling the issue of unequal access to education requires both short term

Subject: The Importance of the Electoral College for the Presidential Election

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and to urge you to continue its use for the election of the President of the United States. While there have been calls to abolish this system and replace it with a popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College serves a crucial purpose in preserving the integrity of our democracy and ensuring fair representation for all states.

First and foremost, the Electoral College was established by our founding fathers as a compromise between electing the President through a vote in Congress and a popular vote of qualified citizens. It prevents the dominance of heavily populated states and ensures that every region of our country has a voice in the selection of our leader. The winner-takes-all system, although criticized, ensures that a candidate must have support across multiple states rather than simply relying on strongholds in populous areas.

Moreover, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome and avoids the potential for disputed elections. As evidenced by the 2000 presidential election, a dispute over the popular vote can lead to prolonged legal battles and unrest. The Electoral College, on the other hand, prevents such disputes as the winner's share of the electoral votes invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. This not only brings stability to the electoral process but also eliminates the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes, which can complicate the election process.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that all citizens have a stake in the election by requiring candidates to have trans-regional appeal. No region in the United States has enough electoral votes to solely elect a president. Therefore, candidates are incentivized to campaign and focus their efforts on swing states, where voters are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and make informed decisions. This ensures that the most thoughtful voters, who have received the most information and attention from the candidates, ultimately decide the election.

Additionally, the Electoral College restores balance and gives proportional representation to smaller states. Large states already have an advantage in the form of a higher population count and therefore receive more attention from presidential candidates. The Electoral College ensures that smaller states have a say by granting each state a number of electors equal to their representation in Congress. This prevents candidates from ignoring the concerns and needs of the citizens living in smaller states and promotes a more inclusive democracy.

While critics argue that the Electoral College is unfair and outdated, the system has stood the test of time and has proven to be a safeguard against the potential pitfalls of a popular vote. In fact, calls to abolish the Electoral College often arise from the immediate discontent following a few rare instances where the winner of the electoral vote did not win the popular vote. These instances are exceptions rather than the norm and should not serve as grounds for dismantling a system that has served our nation well for over two centuries.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a vital component of our democratic process. It ensures fair representation for all states, prevents disputed elections, promotes regional balance, and encourages candidates to campaign nationwide. I urge you to consider the importance of this system and to oppose any efforts to abolish or change it. The preservation of the Electoral College is crucial in maintaining the principles upon which our great nation was founded.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust in your wisdom and commitment to upholding the democratic values of our state and our nation.

Sincerely,

Attending classes at school provides unique advantages not available through online classes. For example, attending school provides students with face-to-face communication with their peers and instructors. Additionally, a physical campus allows for collaboration between students in groups which can be difficult to replicate online. 

On the other hand, taking classes online has its own advantages. It allows students to learn from any location, providing a greater degree of flexibility than attending classes in person. Moreover, online classes might be more accessible in terms of price and having higher technology-related requirements in order for the student to attend their classes. 

If everyone took classes online, schools would face the challenge of fewer students attending. This could lead to fewer resources available for students, a possibly reduced class selection, and the disruption of field trips and extracurriculars due to lack of participation. Ultimately, this could lead to decreased school spirit and a feeling of disconnect from the school community overall.",1
"In today's society, conformity is highly valued, and many cultures encourage individuals to fit a specific mold in order to be accepted. This often involves sacrificing a large part of one's own personality and adopting the behaviors and beliefs of others. While some may argue that conformity is necessary for social cohesion, I believe that it is important to embrace our individuality and think and behave differently. In this essay, I will provide specific reasons and examples to support my viewpoint.

Firstly, when we conform to the expectations of others, we limit our potential for growth and creativity. If everyone thinks and behaves the same way, there is no room for new ideas and perspectives. In contrast, when we embrace our individuality, we bring new insights and experiences to the table, which can lead to innovation and progress. For example, many of the greatest minds throughout history, from Albert Einstein to Steve Jobs, were known for their unique thinking and willingness to challenge the status quo.

Secondly, sacrificing our personality to fit in can have negative effects on our mental health and well-being. When we constantly try to mold ourselves to fit in with others, we may experience anxiety, depression, and a sense of disconnection from our true selves. This can lead to a lack of authenticity and fulfillment in our lives. On the other hand, when we embrace our individuality, we are more likely to feel confident and self-assured, which can improve our overall sense of well-being.

Lastly, valuing conformity over individuality can lead to discrimination and prejudice. When we judge others based on their differences, whether it be their race, gender, sexual orientation, or beliefs, we perpetuate division and inequality. In contrast, when we celebrate diversity and encourage individuals to express their unique identities, we create a more inclusive and accepting society. For example, the LGBTQ+ community has made great strides in recent years towards greater acceptance and equality, largely due to the efforts of individuals who were willing to embrace their differences and fight for their rights.

In conclusion, while many cultures encourage conformity, I believe that it is important to embrace our individuality and think and behave differently. Doing so can lead to greater creativity, mental well-being, and social acceptance. We should celebrate diversity and encourage others to express their unique identities, rather than pressuring them to fit a specific mold. By doing so, we can create a more inclusive and accepting society, where everyone feels valued and respected for who they are.

"The effects of air pollution on the environment have been a topic of increased concern in recent years. With more and more cities being surrounded by smog, it has become an issue that cannot be overlooked any longer. Air pollution has various sources, including emissions from factories and cars, aerosols used in constructing products, burning biomass such as wood or charcoal for fuel, and dust particles released into the atmosphere due to construction activities. All these contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone – a harmful pollutant that can cause respiratory problems among humans, along with damaging crops and ecosystems across the globe. Air pollution not only affects human health but also causes widespread damage to our natural environment. Carbon dioxide is one particular greenhouse gas that contributes significantly to global warming by trapping heat near Earth’s surface. This increases temperatures which leads to malfunctioning weather patterns like erratic rains or droughts; both of which can have devastating consequences for plants, animals and human livelihoods alike. Moreover, when chemicals are released into the atmosphere they may travel long distances before settling down onto land or water surfaces leading to acid rain – something that destroys aquatic lifeforms in lakes and rivers around us while negatively impacting agricultural production too!. In addition to direct environmental damages caused by air pollutants there are many indirect impacts as well - like disruption of food chains where certain species may no longer find suitable habitats due lack of clean air supply; changes in climate resulting in crop losses; new diseases emerging; spread of existing infectious agents over greater distances faster than ever before etcetera… The list goes on!. It’s clear then why we need stronger efforts towards reducing emissions from all sources if we want our planet’s future generations enjoy a safe living experience without compromising their wellbeing too much due continuous exposure toxic substances produced through man-made activities today!

Extending the school day to 10 hours could provide students with enough time to both complete their homework and get sufficient rest. This change could have both positive and negative impacts on the students and teachers. On the one hand, more time in the classroom could enable students to pursue more activities, such as extracurriculars, that would otherwise be impossible due to the time constraints that come with a normal 8-hour school day. Additionally, it could also benefit the teacher-student relationship as teachers have more time to connect with their students. On the other hand, the change would place a strain on energy, water, and other resources, as more time in class would require more resources to accommodate. Therefore, it may be better for schools to opt for four 10-hour days instead of five 8-hour days, as this would balance out the resource consumption while still providing students with ample time for their homework and rest.",1

Honesty is a fundamental part of any healthy relationship. In the context of family and friends, being honest can aid in creating a comfortable and trusting bond. As the saying goes, honesty is the best policy. However, while honesty can be an advantage in relationships, it can also be a double-edged sword. On the one hand, speaking honestly can allow family and friends to gain a clear understanding of each other. On the other hand, it can at times lead to hurt feelings, arguments, and other consequences.

Being dishonest, or lying, can be just as damaging. Lying can lead to mistrust both in the present and in the future. It can cause feelings of guilt and anxiety, making communication difficult. Lying can be especially damaging in long-term relationships as people come to doubt the validity of what a person is saying or doing.

Honesty is the key to cultivating and maintaining strong relationships. By speaking honestly and openly, it is easier for family and friends to understand each other and to be more connected. Not only can it lead to respect in relationships, but it also fosters a greater sense of security. Plus, the longer these relationships are maintained, the stronger the sense of trust will become.",1
"When it comes to traveling, most people agree that it is best to do so in a group led by a tour guide. There are a few reasons for this. First, a tour guide can provide a wealth of information about the destination, the history of the area, and the various attractions that can be seen. This can make the trip much more enjoyable for everyone involved. Additionally, a tour guide can be a great source of support if something goes wrong. They can help to navigate around difficult situations and help to get everyone back on track. Finally, a tour guide can be a great source of advice about what to see and do while in the destination. This can help to make the trip more tailored to the individual traveler’s interests.

There are a few disadvantages to traveling with a tour guide, however. First, a tour guide can be quite expensive. This can add up quickly if the traveler is planning on visiting a number of different attractions. Additionally, a tour guide may not be available on certain days or at certain times. This can make it difficult to schedule a trip that meets the traveler’s specific needs. Finally, a tour guide may not be familiar with all of the best places to eat or drink in the destination. This can lead to some unpleasant surprises.

Overall, the advantages of traveling with a tour guide outweigh the disadvantages by a large margin. If the traveler is able to find a good tour guide, they should definitely consider using them.

"Disagreement can be a powerful tool for learning, and I disagree with the assertion that it can cause stress and inhibit learning. On the contrary, I believe that when disagreements are handled respectfully, they can be a valuable source of knowledge and insight.

First of all, it is important to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy disagreement. Healthy disagreements are those in which all parties express their views and listen to the other person’s perspective with an open mind. In this type of disagreement, people can learn from each other’s unique perspectives and challenge each other’s ideas in a constructive manner. Unhealthy disagreements, on the other hand, are often characterized by personal attacks, judgment, closed-mindedness, and a lack of mutual respect. This type of disagreement does not lead to learning, as it is focused on winning an argument rather than finding a solution.

When disagreements are handled respectfully, they can be a valuable source of knowledge and insight. People with different perspectives can offer unique insights and ideas, which can help us to expand our views and challenge our existing beliefs. For example, when faced with an argument that contradicts our own, we may be able to find evidence to support our own perspective or identify alternative solutions. Additionally, engaging in disagreement can help us to better understand our own beliefs and develop better problem-solving skills.

Moreover, disagreements can also teach us important lessons about empathy and respect. Engaging in healthy debate with someone who has a different viewpoint can help us to develop our communication skills and learn to respect other people’s opinions, even if we don’t necessarily agree with them. Additionally, it can help us to gain an understanding of why people disagree and learn to appreciate different perspectives.

In conclusion, while disagreements can cause stress, they can also be a valuable source of knowledge and insight when handled respectfully. Engaging in healthy debate can help us to challenge our existing beliefs, develop better problem-solving skills, practice empathy, and learn to respect other people’s opinions. For all these reasons, I would argue that we can often learn more from people whose views contradict our own than from those whose views we share.

Distance learning has become a popular option for many students, and with it, certain risks and benefits arise. While remote learning can offer an accessible and flexible learning experience, it can also have adverse effects on student attendance and cheating. 

When it comes to attendance, many students may find themselves less inclined to actively participate in classes due to lack of in-person interaction. This can result in low levels of engagement, and may lead to poor learning outcomes. Furthermore, there is an increased possibility that students may cheat on tests or quizzes when not supervised by teachers. To counteract this, teachers must find innovative solutions to ensure that students do not take advantage of online learning.

Distance learning can also have an impact on teachers' jobs, as they may feel overworked or lack the freedom to instruct classes in their usual manner. However, when adapted properly, remote learning can be an effective method of teaching that can benefit both teachers and students.

The potential of students dropping out of school while learning from home is also a concern. Without regular attendance or in-person supervision, more students may remain long-term absent from school, impeding their learning progress. Governance must be implemented to ensure distance learning is effective but not abused. 

All in all, while there are risk associated with distance learning, there are also many positive aspects, such as enhanced access to education for students who may otherwise struggle to attend school. With the right strategies in place, distance learning can be a safe and beneficial educational system.",1
"The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and advocate against the idea of changing to a popular vote system for the election of the President of the United States. The Electoral College plays a crucial role in maintaining our democratic process and upholding the principles on which our founding fathers established this nation.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome. With the winner-take-all system, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote, providing a clear and decisive outcome. As witnessed in the 2012 election, President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral vote, compared to only 51.3% of the popular vote. This system minimizes the likelihood of a disputed election and provides a stable framework for the American people.

Another important aspect of the Electoral College is that it ensures that every region of the country has a say in the presidential election. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president on its own. This forces candidates to campaign across the nation, appealing to voters from different backgrounds and perspectives. It ensures that a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to win the presidency and that all Americans feel represented in the highest office.

Furthermore, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. This system gives a voice to the most thoughtful voters who are most likely to pay close attention to the campaign and make informed decisions. It prevents candidates from solely focusing on populous states and neglecting the concerns and issues of smaller states.

The Electoral College also balances the political power between large and small states. The system restores weight to large states that may otherwise lose their influence due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. For instance, in the 2012 election, Florida, with its close popular vote, received 29 electoral votes, while a comparable victory in Wyoming would only yield 3 electoral votes. This balance allows candidates to address the concerns of both small and large states, ensuring a more equitable representation of the American people.

Lastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections. In scenarios where no candidate secures a majority in the popular vote, the Electoral College guarantees the selection of a clear winner. Run-off elections would complicate the presidential election process and may lead to further division among the electorate. The Electoral College acts as a safeguard to ensure a definite outcome and avoid prolonged electoral disputes.

In conclusion, the Electoral College serves as a vital component of our democratic process. It facilitates certainty of outcome, represents the interests of all regions and states, encourages candidates to campaign widely, balances the political power between large and small states, and avoids the complications of run-off elections. While some argue for a popular vote system, it is essential to remember that the Electoral College has served us well for over two centuries and maintains the integrity of our elections.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my perspective. I trust that you will carefully weigh the advantages of the Electoral College in making decisions regarding this matter. I am confident that upholding the Electoral College will ensure a fair and representative election process for future generations of Americans.

"There are two schools of thought when it comes to education: one that emphasizes the importance of understanding ideas and concepts, and another that emphasizes the importance of learning facts. I believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.

One reason why it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts is because they can apply those ideas and concepts to new situations. For example, if a student understands the concept of photosynthesis, they can apply that concept to a plant they have never seen before. On the other hand, if a student only knows the fact that photosynthesis occurs in plants, they will not be able to apply that knowledge to a new situation.

Another reason why it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts is because they can build on those ideas and concepts. For example, if a student understands the concept of photosynthesis, they can learn about the different factors that affect it, such as light intensity and carbon dioxide levels. On the other hand, if a student only knows the fact that photosynthesis occurs in plants, they will not be able to build on that knowledge.

Finally, understanding ideas and concepts helps students to think critically. For example, if a student understands the concept of photosynthesis, they can question why some plants are more efficient at it than others. On the other hand, if a student only knows the fact that photosynthesis occurs in plants, they will not be able to think critically about it.

In conclusion, I believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.

"The power of music is an indelible part of our lives, and its ability to bring people together for a common cause has been demonstrated time and again. In particular, the bluegrass genre of musical expression has been used in recent decades to both unite fans from all walks of life as well as bring attention to important social issues. While there are many styles within the broad category that listeners enjoy, it can be argued that bluegrass offers more than mere entertainment — it provides a powerful platform for spreading awareness and creating change in our world today. In terms of sheer entertainment value alone, bluegrass stands out due to its unique mix of elements pulled from various traditional genres such as folk, country and gospel music. It features prominent use of acoustic string instruments (banjo, guitar, fiddle) along with steady rhythm provided by bass or drums which create a distinctive sound palette that never fails to capture the listener’s attention. Lyrically speaking too these recordings tend towards positive messages about unity and standing up against oppression – themes which lend them even greater impact when performed live on stage at concerts or festivals where attendees can feel immediately connected with one another through shared experiences beyond just hearing great music. Beyond providing simple enjoyment however this style also offers an opportunity for those involved in organizing events featuring these artists to make their platforms count towards societal progress if desired; whether it be supporting causes like civil rights movements or campaigns related to environmental protection etc., simply raising awareness about significant matters serves as potential motivation behind some organizers/artists putting on shows rather than merely aiming solely at profitability from ticket sales etc. This trend is seen especially among younger performers who often choose not only their song selections carefully but also make sure they have relevant merchandise available depicting meaningful statements alongside their sets during performances; furthering their personal message while simultaneously helping attendees feel connected with what's being said onstage & potentially sparking conversations between audience members regarding topics discussed thereby increasing chances at change actually being made happen someday down the

John Lubbock was a British naturalist and politician who made a major impact in both fields. He was a major proponent for the study of nature, advocating for more access to the countryside for the public, and pushing for greater recognition for the role that natural history played in educating the public. He was also an influential politician and peer of the British Parliament, being a strong voice for nature conservation and scientific exploration. 

Lubbock's accomplishments show how the ability to take ownership of one's own unique traits can lead to success. By embracing his passion for natural history and his pursuant of a political career, he forged a unique path for himself. His unwillingness to confine himself to any one path enabled him to bring an unprecedented perspective to both the political and scientific worlds, making him a revolutionary figure in both. He serves as an example of the power of freedom of choice and determination to make a mark on the world.",1
"Football fandom is an interesting phenomenon that has captivated millions around the world. In the United States, football fans show their allegiance with colors and chants, talismans and rituals. There are many ways for a fan to express their love for their team, but one of the most popular methods is through tailgating. Tailgating may seem like a simple concept on its surface; it involves gathering outside of a football stadium before a game to socialize while enjoying snacks and drinks in anticipation of kickoff. But there’s so much more meaning behind this beloved pre-game party than meets the eye. It’s become synonymous with passion, camaraderie, tradition – even culture itself! Tailgaters unite as one group to root on their home team regardless of background or occupation outside the stadium walls. To understand why tailgating has been around since at least 1869 (when Princeton played Rutgers), we must first look into how football became such an important part of American life in general. Football was introduced to college campuses throughout America during this time period as universities sought out innovative new sports to increase school spirit – especially among male students who were no longer able to participate in dueling which had been outlawed by then-President Andrew Jackson's 1830 Proclamation calling for nonviolence between states that were still recovering from The War Of 1812 . Unsurprisingly, these colleges quickly embraced what would go on to be known as “America’s favorite sport."" This growing obsession led directly into developing fanbases dedicated enough to bring friends together before each game started - thus creating modern day tailgate parties!. Around 1985 when ESPN began airing televised college games, ""tailgate food"" started taking center stage at these gatherings-- everything from burgers & hotdogs cooked up over portable grills right outside stadiums all over America began popping up everywhere you looked!. Thus proving just how deeply rooted our collective national enthusiasm truly runs deep within us

Education has a profound impact on both individual economic and social outcomes and global economic and social conditions. Education can provide individuals with opportunities to develop the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in the workforce, thereby improving their individual economic prospects. It can also empower people to have a greater voice in their communities and participate more fully in their societies. Additionally, education can have a positive impact on global economic and social outcomes by creating a more educated and productive workforce.

When it comes to accessing higher education, there are a number of different approaches. Governments can offer student loans, scholarships, and grants to make higher education more accessible. Private companies, nonprofits, and other organizations can also step in to provide financing for students or establish scholarships for underserved communities. Additionally, students can use crowdfunding to raise money for their educations, or take on part-time or full-time jobs to cover tuition costs.

There are many examples of educational efforts that have been successful in promoting economic development or reducing poverty. For instance, in India, the government launched a program to provide free laptops and internet access to economically disadvantaged students, which has resulted in a reduction in poverty in the region. In Tanzania, a program to train teachers in the use of technology has enabled students to access online courses and educational resources that otherwise would not have been available.

In order to make higher education more accessible, governments and other organizations need to create policies and programs that focus on reducing the financial barriers that prevent individuals from attending college. This could include providing more financial aid, expanding student loan and grant programs, and providing tax credits to those who pay tuition. Additionally, more needs to be done to fund and support initiatives that help students access the resources they need to complete their education. 

Finally, education can be used as a tool to create economic opportunities for people. Individuals can use their education to start businesses and develop products that will benefit their communities and economies. Education can also help to increase the productivity of businesses, as workers can use their skills and knowledge to increase efficiency and lower costs. In this way, education can be a powerful tool for reducing poverty and promoting economic development.",1

When it comes to getting advice, it's often best to consult with multiple people. By having a variety of perspectives on a subject from different people, you can get a better idea of what the right decision is for you. People often seek advice on matters such as career paths, relationships, financial decisions, or life decisions. Hearing different perspectives from a range of people can be beneficial and help provide a comprehensive outlook. 

Furthermore, asking for advice is an opportunity to learn something new. People often bring up useful information that you may not have known previously. You might hear of new ideas and opportunities, or even be presented with tools and resources that can help you along the way. Asking for advice can also be a way to make new friends, as it helps foster meaningful conversations and relationships. 

In conclusion, asking multiple people for advice is well worth the effort. Gathering different perspectives can help you make more informed decisions, open up new avenues of learning, and create new relationships.",1
"Car usage is a major contributing factor to greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. It is crucial for us to limit our car usage and find alternative transportation methods in order to reduce our impact on the environment. Multiple examples from around the world demonstrate the advantages of car-free or low-car suburban living.

One such example is the town of Vauban in Germany, where residents have given up their cars. Streets are completely car-free, except for the main thoroughfare where the tram runs. Car ownership is allowed, but parking is limited and expensive. As a result, 70% of Vauban's families do not own cars. This has had a positive effect on the residents, who report feeling happier and less tense. This experiment in low-car suburban life has led to more compact communities and increased accessibility to public transportation.

Similarly, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of pollution caused by cars. Motorists were ordered to leave their cars at home on certain days based on their license plate numbers. The ban led to a 60% decrease in congestion and an improvement in air quality. Exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying multiple passengers to encourage greener alternatives.

The concept of a car-free day has also gained popularity in cities like Bogota, Colombia. This day promotes alternative transportation methods such as hiking, biking, skating, or taking buses. Violators are fined to ensure compliance. The program has been successful in reducing traffic congestion and promoting a healthier environment. Other cities have even adopted this idea and implemented their own car-free days.

These examples show that limiting car usage has numerous advantages. Firstly, it helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. Cars are a major contributor to these problems, and by finding alternative transportation methods, we can make significant progress in combatting climate change. Secondly, limiting car usage reduces congestion in cities, leading to less traffic and improved traffic flow. This ultimately saves time for commuters and reduces frustration. Finally, promoting alternative transportation methods not only benefits the environment but also encourages a more active and healthier lifestyle.

In conclusion, there are clear advantages to limiting car usage. We can see from examples around the world that low-car or car-free living leads to reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, reduced congestion, and a healthier lifestyle. It is important for us to adopt these ideas and find alternative transportation methods in order to create a more sustainable future.",1
"When it comes to creative endeavors, there is no better outlet than music. Music can bring joy and comfort in times of sorrow, lift us up when our spirits are low, and provide a medium for self-expression like no other. Whether one is a master musician or just tinkering around on an instrument for fun, the act of making music has many profound benefits. One of those benefits is the way that it can help improve mental health. Playing an instrument releases dopamine into the brain which helps reduce stress levels while also giving one a feeling of accomplishment and satisfaction. Research suggests that musicians may even be at an advantage over nonmusicians when it comes to problem solving as musical training requires practice with complex patterns and abstract thinking skills used by mathematicians and scientists alike such as working out spatial relationships. Additionally, research has shown that learning to play certain instruments (such as guitar) actually leads to increased cognitive function in both children and adults!. As if these psychological benefits weren't enough reason alone to pick up playing music, there's also the social aspect involved which cannot be overlooked either. From bands made up entirely of close friends to jamming with strangers at open mic nights, making music together gives people opportunities for collaboration unlike any other kind of activity out there - offering individuals experiences in teamwork building not available from traditional team sports or group activities elsewhere yet still providing great enjoyment all the same!. . The art of creating something beautiful from seemingly nothing is powerful beyond words - allowing each individual who participates in this craft access into different parts within themselves they never knew existed before. So don’t wait another moment; grab your favourite instrument today and start exploring what you have been missing out on!

"Sports enhance a person's physical and mental well-being, making them an integral part of life. Baseball is one of the most popular sports in the United States that provides numerous benefits to those who play it. From developing hand-eye coordination to teaching teamwork and perseverance, playing baseball can help individuals become more successful both on and off the field. The importance of hand-eye coordination in everyday life cannot be stressed enough. Tasks such as typing on a computer keyboard or catching a ball require this skill which can be improved through consistent practice in baseball. Playing catch with family members or participating regularly in games at school are two great ways for children to hone their skills when it comes to hand-eye coordination while having fun doing so. The commitment level required for batting practice also encourages discipline which will serve players well not just during baseball but beyond into adulthood as well. Playing team sports like baseball teaches players how to work together towards achieving common goals within limited timeframes, skills that have proven invaluable even after leaving the sport behind later in life; teamwork has been known to increase efficiency when tackling projects outside of sports activities too! Furthermore, learning how different positions contribute differently yet equally helps develop social awareness and respect for others' roles within groups. This understanding serves its purpose whether communicating ideas with colleagues at work or simply conversing with friends about current events over dinner - cooperation is key!. Finally, perseverance is another essential trait needed by anyone looking out for success; being able to hang tough during difficult situations such as trying times present throughout long seasons leads people towards brighter futures where failure becomes no longer an option due only giving up isn't tolerated anymore either! Perseverance allows us all opportunities despite unfortunate circumstances we may encounter along our paths forward in life - something certainly worth remembering every single day - growth never stops until we do so ourselves voluntarily (or otherwise). . In conclusion, there are tremendous benefits offered through playing baseball including improving hand-eye coordination

"Success is a subjective term that means different things to different people. However, one thing that is common among successful people is their willingness to try new things and take risks. I strongly agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. In this essay, I will provide specific reasons and examples to support my opinion.

Firstly, trying new things and taking risks helps individuals to grow and learn. When we step out of our comfort zone and try something new, we are forced to learn new skills and acquire new knowledge. This not only helps us to become more knowledgeable but also makes us more adaptable and versatile. For instance, if a person who has always worked in the IT industry decides to start a restaurant, they will have to learn about food, cooking, and customer service. This will broaden their horizons and make them more well-rounded individuals.

Secondly, taking risks can lead to great rewards. Many successful people have achieved their success by taking calculated risks. For example, Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple, took a risk by introducing the iPod, a product that was not in demand at the time. However, this risk paid off, and the iPod became a huge success, leading to the creation of the iPhone and iPad. Similarly, J. K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series, took a risk by writing a book that was initially rejected by several publishers. However, she persisted, and the book eventually became a bestseller, leading to the creation of a successful franchise.

Thirdly, trying new things and taking risks can lead to personal growth and fulfillment. When we challenge ourselves and achieve something that we never thought was possible, it gives us a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. This, in turn, boosts our confidence and self-esteem. For example, if a person who has always been afraid of public speaking takes a risk and gives a speech, they may feel nervous at first, but once they have successfully delivered the speech, they will feel a sense of pride and accomplishment.

In conclusion, trying new things and taking risks is an essential part of achieving success. It helps individuals to grow and learn, can lead to great rewards, and can lead to personal growth and fulfillment. Therefore, I strongly agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.

"Successful people in the history became famous and successful because they invented new things or they found out something that no one knew. For example, Leonardo da Vinci invented the printing press, Thomas Edison invented light bulbs, and Albert Einstein discovered the theory of relativity. In other words, successful people are not only successful in their field of expertise, but they are also able to think outside of their comfort zone and find new ways of doing things.

What do you think is the most important thing you have learned in your life? I learned that you can't always get what you want. You have to be willing to work hard to achieve your goals.

",1
"Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. I agree with this statement for a few reasons. First, successful people are usually passionate about what they do. They don't just do something because it's easy or they're good at it. They do it because they love it. This means that they're always looking for new ways to improve their skills and knowledge. They're willing to take risks because they believe in their abilities and they're always trying to learn more.

Second, successful people are usually very confident. They know that they can handle whatever comes their way. This confidence allows them to take risks without being afraid of the consequences. They're not afraid to fail because they know that they can always learn from their mistakes.

Third, successful people are usually very persistent. They don't give up easily. If they take a risk and it doesn't work out, they'll try again. They know that the only way to achieve something great is to keep trying.

So, I believe that successful people try new things and take risks because they're passionate, confident, and persistent. They know that the only way to achieve their goals is to keep learning and expanding their horizons.

The idea of a four-day school week has been met with both praise and scrutiny. Proponents argue that it would offer a much needed reprieve for students, families, and teachers alike. Research suggests that students could benefit from reduced stress brought about by eliminating the school week entirely on Fridays. In addition, parental involvement could increase, as families could use Friday as a day for enrichment activities with their children. 

On the other hand, disadvantages to a four-day school week could include longer school days for students and a more complex schedule for teachers. In addition, student-family relationships could be strained due to longer hours away from home and an increased academic workload. Furthermore, students may find it difficult to maintain their focus for a longer school day or to stay motivated over a longer school week.

The potential effects of a four-day school week should be considered carefully before deciding whether to move forward with such a change. The potential advantages and disadvantages should be thoroughly evaluated to create an equitable outcome that addresses the needs of students, families and teachers alike.",1
"Mobile phones are a ubiquitous part of modern life. Everywhere you look, people have their heads down, watching screens and tapping away on keyboards. As mobile technology continues to evolve and become ever more pervasive, it is important that we understand the implications of our growing dependence on them. The most obvious way in which mobile phones have changed our lives is the sheer convenience they offer. We can now stay connected with family members, friends, colleagues and clients at any time of day or night from almost anywhere in the world. This has transformed how we communicate with each other- instead of having to wait for weeks for replies by mail or months for telephone calls across international borders- instant messages can be sent back and forth within seconds no matter where either party may be located geographically. This has revolutionized social interaction as well as business relationships around the globe; opportunities that were once only available to those who had access to traditional communication networks are now available to everyone thanks to mobile phones. However this newfound freedom also presents some dangers; many people spend too much time on their devices, leading to increased stress levels due reduced physical activity and added pressures placed upon us by having an 'always on' mentality when it comes to communication expectations. Addiction issues can also arise if appropriate boundaries aren't set regarding usage times or perhaps even worse if phone notifications become a substitute form of emotional gratification rather than real human contact being sought after instead! The potential impact that these issues could have long term should not be underestimated when thinking about how much time one should realistically commit per day towards using their device(s). In conclusion then we must recognize both sides of this coin when discussing the effects that mobile phones have had upon society over recent years: They provide unprecedented levels of convenience yet simultaneously pose certain risks if not used responsibly enough! It's therefore up each individual user themselves decide where best draw a line between these two extremes so as ensure healthy balance between digital consumption versus actual person-to-person human

Recently, my school made a policy change requiring students to maintain a B average or higher in order to participate in sports and extracurricular activities. I strongly believe this policy change is unreasonable and unfair. 

First of all, participating in activities such as sports and clubs has been found to have a tremendously positive effect on student productivity, involvement, and overall well-being. Students who are involved in activities such as these have been proven to have higher levels of engagement and have fewer disciplinary issues within the school. Without a chance to pursue these activities, students could suffer a range of negative effects, such as lower motivation and weaker relationships with peers.

Second, this policy unfairly punishes students who may struggle academically. Many students struggle in one or more subjects and have to work much harder to pass their classes. Even though they may put in that extra effort, a B average may still be out of reach for them. It doesn't seem fair that these students should be left out of these important activities that can help them succeed in some form or another.

Lastly, this policy reinforces the idea that only students who excel in academics are worthy of success. By setting such high academic standards, students are made to feel inferior if they do not reach this academic benchmark. In reality, success takes on many forms, and we should recognize and encourage students to pursue avenues that may not always include academic excellence.

The policy change on sports and activities requiring B average grades is rigid and overlooks the importance of extracurricular activities for our students. By no means should we lower our academic standards, but rather recognize the various forms of success among our student body.",1
"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Introduction:
In recent years, there has been a growing trend in limiting car usage in various parts of the world. Encouragingly, this movement is gaining momentum as societies become more conscious of the negative impacts of excessive car dependency. The advantages of reducing car usage are numerous and span across environmental, social, and economic factors. By restricting car ownership and promoting alternative forms of transportation, such as public transit, cycling, and walking, communities can reap the benefits of smarter planning and a more sustainable future.

Body Paragraph One: Mitigating Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Limiting car usage is crucial in the fight against climate change. Passenger cars are responsible for a significant percentage of greenhouse gas emissions in both Europe and the United States. In Europe, they contribute to 12 percent of emissions, rising to as high as 50 percent in certain car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing reliance on automobiles, we can significantly decrease the carbon footprint associated with transportation. This is especially important as countries strive to meet emission reduction targets and transition towards a more sustainable future.

Body Paragraph Two: Enhancing Urban and Suburban Planning
Restricting car usage allows for more efficient and sustainable urban and suburban planning. Suburban communities like Vauban in Germany and Bogota in Colombia have already implemented car-free zones or days, demonstrating the benefits of this approach. In these neighborhoods, streets are designed with pedestrians and cyclists in mind, with homes, shops, and amenities located within walking or cycling distance. This approach promotes exercise, reduces traffic congestion, and enhances community interaction. By prioritizing public transportation and infrastructure for pedestrians and cyclists, cities and suburbs can create more livable and accessible spaces for their residents.

Body Paragraph Three: Economic Considerations
Contrary to popular belief, limiting car usage can have positive economic impacts. A reduction in car ownership and usage leads to decreased demand for fuel and automobile-related expenses. Families can save money by utilizing alternative modes of transportation, such as public transit or cycling. Moreover, the reallocation of resources from building and maintaining roads and parking spaces can be redirected towards other pressing needs, such as improving public transportation networks or investing in renewable energy infrastructure. Overall, limiting car usage can create economic opportunities and alleviate financial burdens for individuals and communities.

Conclusion:
The advantages of limiting car usage are multifaceted and have far-reaching implications for our environment, society, and economy. By implementing smart planning strategies, communities can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, foster healthier and more livable neighborhoods, and stimulate economic growth. The examples of Vauban in Germany, Bogota in Colombia, and other cities around the world demonstrate that it is possible to create sustainable and car-free environments. As we strive for a more sustainable future, it is imperative that we continue to prioritize alternative forms of transportation and explore innovative ways to transform our communities into car-reduced or even car-free spaces.",1
"The written word has been the main source of information for centuries, but with the advent of the internet, that is no longer the case. The internet has become the primary source of information for people all over the world. It is estimated that over three billion people have access to the internet, and that number is growing every day. The internet has a vast amount of information that is available at the click of a button. You can find information on anything and everything on the internet.

The book is no longer the primary source of information because people can find what they are looking for faster on the internet. When you want to find information on a specific topic, you can do a quick search on the internet and find a wealth of information. You can also find information on the internet that you cannot find in a book. For example, if you want to know how to do something, you can find a tutorial on the internet. There are also a lot of things that you can do on the internet that you cannot do in a book. For example, you can watch videos, listen to music, and play games.

The internet has also made it easier to find information. In the past, if you wanted to find information on a specific topic, you would have to go to the library and look through the card catalog. Now, you can just do a quick search on the internet and find what you are looking for. You can also find information on the internet that you would not be able to find in a library.

The internet has replaced the book as the primary source of information because it is more convenient, it has more information, and it is easier to find information.

Excerpt:

Throughout history, failure has often been the precursor to success, and Winston Churchill is famously quoted for remarking that “success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.” This simple quotation succinctly illustrates an important truth- failure should not be feared, but embraced. It is difficult to succeed without first having failed. To better understand this concept, it is important to consider two main reasons why failure can lead to success. 

First, failure can often provide valuable insight and guidance in our lives. The knowledge that one gains through failing can help them to better equip themselves for future success. For example, Thomas Edison famously remarked that failure taught him a thousand ways not to build a lightbulb. This perspective allowed him to look at each instance of failure as a lesson, rather than an impediment to success. Another example of this notion is when Oprah Winfrey failed a major quiz in high school. Though originally considering it a disappointment, Oprah remarked later that “it was the best thing”, as it changed her attitude towards learning and inspired her to take courses she was genuinely passionate about.

Second, failure can provide an emotional sense of resilience that is necessary for success. Those that can effectively learn from their mistakes and use their failures as a source of motivation can become more resilient. As an example of this, Michael Jordan was famously cut from his high school basketball team, but through hard work and dedication he became one of the greatest basketball players of all time. Another case in point is J.K. Rowling, who got several rejections in her attempt to find a publisher for her now renowned book Harry Potter. However, she persevered and eventually found someone who believed in her story and was willing to take a chance. 

All in all, failure is a concept that should not be feared, but seen as an important stepping stone to achieving ultimate success. It plays a pivotal role in helping us to develop qualities such as resilience in order to reach our goals. Thus, it is important to remember Winston Churchill's words- that success is not final, failure is not fatal; it is the courage to continue that counts.",1
"Title: Advantages of Limiting Car Usage for a Smarter Future

Introduction:
The issue of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, specifically from vehicles, has become a pressing concern for both developed and developing nations. As a result, initiatives such as car-free neighborhoods, driving bans, and car-free days have been introduced to limit car usage. This essay will discuss the advantages of limiting car usage based on evidence from multiple sources, highlighting the benefits to the environment, public health, and quality of life.

Body Paragraphs:
1. Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions: 
Car emissions account for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions, a leading cause of climate change. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal's New York Times article, passenger cars contribute to 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in certain car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage, we can significantly reduce these emissions and mitigate the impact of climate change.

2. Improved air quality and public health:
Driving bans, such as the one implemented in Paris due to smog, not only help combat pollution but also improve air quality. In Robert Duffer's article from the Chicago Tribune, congestion in Paris decreased by 60 percent after a five-day driving ban, bringing the city's air pollution levels down. This improvement in air quality leads to a decrease in respiratory problems and other health issues caused by pollution, benefiting the overall well-being of citizens.

3. Enhanced accessibility and livability:
Smart planning, as highlighted in Elisabeth Rosenthal's article, seeks to separate suburban life from excessive car usage. Vauban, a car-free community in Germany, serves as an example of how limiting car usage can lead to a more accessible and livable neighborhood. With stores located within walking distance and public transportation easily accessible, residents can lead more sustainable lives without the need for personal vehicles. This concept is being adopted worldwide, creating compact and accessible suburbs that prioritize public transportation over cars.

4. Economical and efficient transportation:
By limiting car usage and encouraging alternative modes of transportation, communities can reduce the burden on infrastructure. Instead of investing in extensive road networks and parking spaces, resources can be diverted to improve public transportation systems. Car-free communities can also promote efficient car-sharing programs, reducing the need for individuals to own cars and saving them money on maintenance and other associated costs.

5. Changing cultural norms:
As mentioned in Elisabeth Rosenthal's article, studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less. This shift in behavior not only contributes to reduced emissions but also indicates a cultural change in our perception of personal vehicles. Younger generations are less concerned about car ownership and prioritize alternative transportation options. This change in attitude presents an opportunity to reshape our cities and prioritize sustainable modes of transportation.

Conclusion:
The advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and far-reaching, benefiting the environment, public health, and the livability of communities. By adopting smart planning principles and encouraging alternative modes of transport, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, enhance accessibility, and promote sustainable transportation practices. Implementing these changes now can help secure a smarter and more sustainable future for all.",1

Pianos and saxophones are two of the most widely-used instruments in the world of music. With a piano, you can play a broad range of music, including classical, jazz, pop, rock, blues, and more. As for saxophones, their sound can be heard in all sorts of genres, including jazz, blues, rock, funk, Latin, reggae, and more. 

Guitars come in several varieties, most notably acoustic, distorted, and clean. An acoustic guitar has a signature warm and mellow sound, and is best-suited for acoustic and folk music. Distorted guitars are often used in progressive and heavy metal music for a heavier sound, with electric guitar solos often using this type of guitar. Lastly, clean guitars are favored by jazz, folk, and country musicians for their full, natural sound.

The amount of time it takes to learn an instrument will depend on the individual's level of commitment and dedication. Someone who practices regularly can learn to play each instrument quite quickly, while others might take longer. It's also important to note that not everyone learns at the same rate. 

In conclusion, each of these three instruments has its own set of sounds and styles that make it distinct. With the right practice and dedication, any musician can master all of these instruments and use them to create their own unique music.",1

Cell phones have become integral components of everyday life, and their presence in the classroom is no exception. As technology advances, many teachers are beginning to recognize the potential benefits of allowing students to use their cell phones for educational purposes. When used properly, cell phones can provide convenient access to a wealth of digital resources, improve communication between students and teachers, and encourage greater participation in class. 

For students, using cell phones in the classroom can provide a more intuitive way of engaging with educational content. By allowing students to take photos, watch videos, or access online resources, teachers can provide more tailored instruction, better engage with their students, and support the development of digital literacy skills. For example, if a teacher is introducing a new topic, they could ask students to access an online encyclopedia or search engine to learn more about the subject. 

Cell phones can also benefit the learning environment by providing a simple way to connect with teachers and classmates. Social media apps, instant messaging, and video conferencing can all be used to facilitate collaboration between students, while also providing teachers with a streamlined way to spread information such as assignment deadlines or upcoming events. For instance, a teacher could use a messaging app to deliver updates about a group project or schedule an online meeting to discuss the progress of the assignment. 

The use of cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes can bring numerous advantages, both for students and teachers alike. By promoting greater engagement with learning, encouraging student collaboration, and providing convenient access to digital resources, cell phones can be a powerful tool to enhance any educational setting.",1
"Giving back to one's community is an important part of being a productive member of society. It is a way of showing that we care about the place where we live and the people who live there with us. Unfortunately, many young people today do not seem to value community service as much as they should.

There are a number of reasons why this might be the case. First of all, young people are often very busy with school, work, and other commitments. They may not have a lot of free time to dedicate to volunteer work. Additionally, young people may not be aware of the many ways in which they can help their communities. They may not know where to start or what kinds of activities would be most helpful. Finally, some young people may simply be selfish and uninterested in giving back to their communities.

Whatever the reasons may be, it is important for young people to try to find ways to give back to their communities. There are many ways to do this, and even a small amount of time or effort can make a big difference. For example, young people can volunteer at local schools, hospitals, or community centers. They can help with fundraising or awareness campaigns for important causes. They can also simply be good neighbors by helping with yard work, shoveling snow, or running errands for elderly or disabled people.

Giving back to one's community is important for many reasons. It helps to make our communities better places to live, and it also sets a good example for others. Young people who take the time to help their communities can make a real difference.

"Recently, there has been a lot of hype surrounding the advancement of artificial intelligence technology. However, while it may be important to consider the ethical implications and long-term effects associated with utilizing AI, we must also acknowledge the immense benefits this technology can bring us in our everyday lives. From automated customer service representatives to robots that help do household chores or medical caretakers for elderly people, AI is enabling humans to tackle new problems more efficiently and effectively than ever before. One particular application of artificial intelligence that has recently gained prominence is autonomous driving cars. Autonomous vehicles are equipped with advanced sensors like radar and cameras which enable them to detect their surroundings and make decisions without human intervention - making them incredibly safe on roads compared to those driven by humans. They can also utilize predictive analytics times when traffic jams occur during rush hour so as to adjust their speed accordingly; thereby reducing commute time significantly for everyone involved. Additionally, these vehicles are expected to reduce air pollution levels due to their lower emissions profiles – helping create healthier environments everywhere they go!. The potential of autonomous driving cars goes far beyond what was just mentioned however; developers have already created systems that allow users control over how much energy they want their car’s internal combustion engine (ICE) use while driving – providing drivers with yet another layer of safety and convenience when operating these futuristic machines. Furthermore, advancements made in natural language processing (NLP) algorithms have enabled self-driving cars understand verbal commands given by its passengers – allowing a user complete freedom over his/her vehicle’s operations regardless if it’s offline or online– something that was unheard up until now! Finally, auto manufacturers are beginning integrate machine learning capabilities into autonomous vehicles so as increase overall performance level even further – thus opening doors towards an entirely new realm transportation possibilities fueled exclusively by Artificial Intelligence (AI). All things considered, it is clear why many believe the future lies in the hands of intelligent machines powered by sophisticated AI algorithms

"There are two schools of thought when it comes to how the media should treat celebrities. Some believe that celebrities are unfairly targeted by the media and should be given more privacy. Others believe that this is the price of their fame. I believe that the latter is true.

While it is true that celebrities are often put under a microscope by the media, I believe that this is the price of their fame. Celebrities choose to live their lives in the public eye and, as such, they should expect to have their every move scrutinized. It is unfair to expect privacy when one has chosen to live their life in such a public way.

That being said, I do believe that the media should be respectful in their coverage of celebrities. There is a line between reporting on someone’s life and invading their privacy, and the media should be aware of that line. However, at the end of the day, I believe that it is the responsibility of the celebrity to be aware of the risks of living their life in the public eye and to make the decision accordingly.

"Competition for high grades is an issue that has been widely debated in the educational system. It is widely believed that competition for high grades forces students to focus more on grades than the quality of their learning. While the competition for high grades can be beneficial in some areas of learning, it can also have a negative impact on the quality of learning at all levels of education.

On the one hand, competition for high grades is often seen as beneficial in some areas of learning. For example, in order to receive higher grades, students may be incentivized to work harder and put in extra effort to ensure they are achieving their best work. This can be seen in areas such as mathematics, where students can be encouraged to practice and master techniques before sitting an exam. Furthermore, competition for high grades can lead to better student engagement and motivation, as students feel more driven to excel. For example, in the classroom, students may feel more inclined to take part in classroom discussions and pay attention in lectures, in order to ensure they are receiving the best grades available.

However, while competition for high grades can be beneficial in some areas of learning, it can also have a detrimental impact on the quality of learning. Firstly, competition for high grades can lead to a focus on memorizing facts and figures, rather than understanding and applying the material to real world situations. This is especially true for subjects such as history, where students are encouraged to learn dates and facts in order to gain a higher grade. This approach can be detrimental to learning, as it fails to engage students in a deeper understanding of the material, which is essential for a strong educational foundation. 

Another problem caused by competition for high grades is that it can lead to a lack of creativity and critical thinking skills. In order to receive higher grades, students may be incentivized to follow rigid educational guidelines, rather than think outside of the box and explore new ideas. This can be seen in areas such as literature, where students are encouraged to focus on the main plot points and characters, rather than take a deeper look at the subtext and themes in the novel.

In conclusion, while competition for high grades can be beneficial, it can also have a negative impact on the quality of learning at all levels of education. A focus on memorizing facts and figures can lead to a lack of understanding and application in real world situations, while a focus on following rigid educational guidelines can lead to a lack of creativity and critical thinking skills. Therefore, it is important for educators to create a balance between competition for higher grades and quality learning, in order to ensure that students are achieving the best results possible.

Whether travelling to an exotic destination or just a short hop away, travelling can be an enriching experience that broadens your understanding of the world and yourself. When you’re exposed to new cultures and surroundings, it encourages you to think differently about life and opens up opportunities for self-reflection. You learn more about yourself by being in unfamiliar places where everything is different from what you’ve grown accustomed to at home. Even the smallest trips can inspire questions like “What makes me happy? What do I value most? Why do I think this way?"". Through these experiences, we become more aware of our core beliefs which leads us closer towards achieving greater inner peace and contentment with ourselves. Travelling also allows us to understand how people around the globe are connected despite our differences in language, culture, religion etc. It gives us a chance to build relationships through mutual empathy as well as explore foreign destinations together – creating lifelong memories along the way! By interacting with locals on their own turf, we get a glimpse into different ways of living that stand apart from ours while still having commonalities across communities no matter where they are situated geographically. In addition, traveling exposes us not only to new perspectives but also challenges preconceived notions we may have had prior due to ignorance or lack of knowledge leading us towards becoming less biased individuals overall. In summing up why travel should be encouraged; Not only does it open our eyes towards cultures beyond our own and strengthen connections among diverse populations –but it also helps promote personal growth by allowing each individual embarking on such journeys gain better insight into themselves both mentally & spiritually thus cultivating independence and self-awareness necessary for leading fulfilling lives!

"The Impact of Social Media on Education. In recent years, social media has become an integral part of many people’s lives. It has allowed us to connect with our friends and family members from around the world, share news stories and experiences, and – most notably – access vast amounts of information in a matter of seconds. As modern technology continues to expand its reach into every corner of daily life, one area that is increasingly being impacted by the advent of social media is education. At first glance it may seem that there are few benefits for students using social media in the classroom; however, research suggests otherwise. For example, utilizing platforms such as Twitter can be a great way for teachers to communicate with their students outside of class time. Students can access updates about assignments or upcoming tests and also ask questions if they need clarification on something discussed in class. In addition to providing useful resources for learning, some studies have even found that simply having access to these channels can increase student engagement levels as well as overall academic performance. . Social media can also provide an opportunity for collaboration between peers who might not otherwise interact due to different classes or timetables throughout the school day. Platforms like Facebook allow students within the same college or university program to discuss topics related directly back to their coursework and help each other understand concepts more thoroughly than if they were only relying on lectures provided by professors alone. The ability to work together virtually helps build relationships between classmates which could lead them down new paths when pursuing independent research projects during higher level courses later on in their studies. Not all educational implications are positive ones however; there are potential risks associated with too much reliance upon digital technology while learning as well - primarily distraction leading towards decreased attention spans or less active listening habits during lectures among fellow classmates instead interacting over tweets or text messages instead! It is important then that educators understand how best utilize these tools while ensuring appropriate boundaries remain set so everyone enjoys a safe environment conducive towards

"Title: Reducing Automobile Dependency: Multiple Benefits for the Community and the Environment

Recently, cities worldwide are recognizing the benefits of reducing car usage and are taking steps to encourage their citizens to adopt alternative modes of transportation. Despite the convenience that cars provide, their disadvantages are numerous, including their contribution to global warming, air pollution, and traffic congestion.

One primary advantage of reducing car usage deals with the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to Rosenthal, automobiles are responsible for a significant percentage of greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to global warming and climate change (Rosenthal 5). The decrease in miles traversed by vehicles in the United States signifies a promising trend towards achieving President Obama's ambition to curb national greenhouse emissions (Rosenthal 32).

The shift from car-centric communities is also visibly improving air quality. Paris experienced a 60 percent decrease in congestion, resulting in a significant decrease of smog after a partial driving ban was imposed (Duffer 14). Moreover, in Columbia's capital city, Bogota, annual car-free days significantly decrease air pollution, offering citizens the experience of calmer, cleaner, and more communal urban spaces (Selsky 21,24).

Reducing automobile dependency fosters community development as well. Vauban, an experimental German suburb, demonstrated that life without cars could promote a more lively and tension-free urban atmosphere (Rosenthal 3). The typical sounds of a bustling neighbourhood have replaced the noise of automobiles, creating a calmer environment for residents. Moreover, the community's strategic planning prioritizes accessibility to public transportation, with stores located within walking distance rather than isolated shopping malls along remote highways (Rosenthal 4,6).

Reducing car usage also cultivates an atmosphere that encourages physical activity. In Bogota, for instance, the car-free day led to the construction of 118 miles of cycling paths, the most in any Latin American city, thereby promoting health and wellness among its citizens (Selsky 27).

Clearly, the dependency on cars can be reduced without compromising the quality of urban life. Instead, it brings numerous benefits, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, and stronger communities. This societal shift demands collaborative efforts from individuals, businesses, and governments worldwide to imagine and enact a less car-intensive future. By embracing this challenge, we move towards creating environments that are not only sustainable but also more conducive to our well-being.",1
"The pursuit of intellectual interests for personal reasons is often seen as a selfish endeavor, but it could be argued that it benefits society more than attempting to act for the public good. While both approaches have their merits, personal interests often lead to innovation and progress that can have far-reaching consequences, whereas attempting to act for the public good can be hindered by politics and bureaucracy.

First, pursuing one's own intellectual interests can lead to breakthroughs and advances that benefit society as a whole. For example, Marie Curie's fascination with radioactivity led her to discover the elements polonium and radium, which revolutionized medicine and physics. Similarly, Steve Jobs' passion for design and technology led him to create products like the iPhone and iPad, which have transformed the way we communicate and access information. These individuals were not necessarily motivated by the public good, but their discoveries and inventions have had enormous positive impacts on society.

On the other hand, attempting to act for the public good can often be hindered by politics and bureaucracy. Government officials may be more concerned with getting re-elected than with actually making a difference in people's lives, and programs designed to help the needy may become bogged down in red tape and inefficiency. For example, the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, was intended to provide healthcare to millions of Americans who could not afford it, but it's implementation has been plagued by technical problems and political opposition. Similarly, the Paris climate accord aimed to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change, but the United States' withdrawal from the agreement has undermined it's effectiveness.

Moreover, individuals who pursue their own intellectual interests often do so out of a genuine curiosity and passion for their field, whereas those who attempt to act for the public good may be driven more by a desire for recognition or power. This is not to say that there aren't dedicated public servants who genuinely want to make a difference, but the pursuit of personal interests can be more authentic and honest.

Of course, there are also benefits to acting for the public good. Public service can be a noble and selfless endeavor, and it can provide crucial support and assistance to those in need. For example, doctors who volunteer their time and expertise in developing countries can save lives and improve health outcomes, and organizations like the Red Cross provide vital assistance during disasters and emergencies. However, it could be argued that these individuals are still driven by personal motives, whether it be a desire to help others or a sense of moral responsibility.

In conclusion, while both pursuing personal intellectual interests and attempting to act for the public good have their merits, it could be argued that the former benefits society more in the long run. Personal interests often lead to innovation and progress that can have far-reaching impacts, whereas attempting to act for the public good can be hindered by politics and bureaucracy. However, this is not to discount the importance of public service and the many dedicated individuals who work tirelessly to help others. Ultimately, both approaches have their place and can contribute to a better world.

"The winter solstice is a special day for many people who celebrate its coming. For cultures around the world, it marks the darkest and longest night of the year, followed by increasing light in days to come. It’s a time of celebration, reflection, and hope as we look forward to longer days with more sunshine—a reminder that even in our darkest moments there can be glimmers of joy ahead. For some traditions, this season holds special spiritual significance related to death and rebirth; others mark it with various rituals or events that recognize nature’s cycles. In essence though, most celebrations revolve around honoring the changing seasons and recognizing their importance in creating balance in life. The winter solstice has been celebrated since ancient times with bonfires lit on hilltops intended to bring warmth back into homes after long nights without sun. People threw burning logs onto fires while dancing around them symbolizing fertility and prosperity for new growth ahead—an old testament to what we now appreciate about how natural rhythms are essential for collective renewal both spiritually and physically. In modern times too we cling faithfully to these ancient practices like Yule Logs or Christmas trees which bring us together as families during darker months when daylight hours become scarce reminders that spring will soon arrive again bringing along with it hope from darkness through increased sunlight each day until summer returns once more. The winter solstice thus reminds us not only of past traditions but also serves as an invitation for self-reflection about personal journeys toward growth and understanding within ourselves throughout the course of life's journey regardless of where we find ourselves at any given moment—for “winter must always pass before spring comes anew"".

Choosing a career at a young age has both its advantages and disadvantages. Those opposed to making a career choice in their youth are concerned that it will prevent them from exploring other options in other fields, or even from forming an in-depth understanding of their chosen industry. On the other hand, those supporting choosing a career early believe that it gives young people a chance to focus on a specific goal and gives them the determination to strive for it. 

No matter which side of the argument you fall on, there are countless examples of people who achieved their goals despite settling for a career path while they were still young. One example is Mark Zuckerberg, who was a 19-year-old Harvard sophomore when he launched the now widely popular platform, Facebook. 

From Zuckerberg’s success story, we can see that committing to a career early in life can set young people up for higher levels of achievement. Rather than wasting time exploring several unrelated fields, committing to a career at a young age allows students to gain valuable experience and hone their skills, paving the way for possible success. Ultimately, there will always be advantages and disadvantages to choosing a career at a young age, but for those looking to focus on a specific goal and get a head start, it can be a great option.",1
"It is commonly believed that objective observation is unbiased and lacks any personal judgments or expectations. This idea has been propagated throughout the scientific community, with the belief that keeping the observer’s preconceived notions or desires out of the picture will ensure the purity of results. However, any observation, no matter how seemingly ‘objective’ or impartial, is in fact subjective and always informed by the observer’s expectations and desires.

In order to demonstrate this, it is important to first understand the concept of subjectivity. Subjectivity can be defined as “the quality of being influenced by individual perception or opinion”. It follows then, that any observation is necessarily subjective since it is impossible for any observer to possess an entirely neutral perspective. It is impossible to observe something without bringing any preconceived notions or biases to the table, as no person can remain entirely impartial. Even if an observer attempts to remain unbiased, the very act of observing is it'self an act of subjectivity.

The notion of objectivity with regards to observation is further complicated when one considers the fact that the data gathered is still being processed by the observer. In other words, no matter how carefully the observation is conducted, it is still being filtered through the observer’s subjective lenses. This means that even if the observer attempts to remain impartial, their expectations and desires will still shape the results. Even if two observers view the same data, they will come away with different interpretations based on their individual experiences.

For example, two people observing the same event may come away with two different stories. Person A may focus on the positive aspects of the event while person B may be more critical or analytical. Each person’s expectations and desires will cause them to interpret the event differently and thus, the observation will be subjective.

In addition, the observer’s preconceived notions can also influence the way in which data is collected. For example, suppose a researcher is studying the effects of a new drug on a particular population. If the researcher has a positive opinion of the drug, they may be more likely to focus on the positive effects it has on the population and may be less likely to report any adverse effects. This illustrates how even without any conscious effort, the researcher’s expectations and desires will still influence the results of the observation.

Ultimately, it is clear that there is no such thing as a purely objective observation. All observation is subjective; it is always guided by the observer’s expectations or desires. No matter how carefully an observation is conducted, the observer’s preconceived notions or biases will still shape the results. Even if two observers view the same data, they will come away with different interpretations based on their individual experiences. Therefore, it is important to recognize that even the most objective observation is still subjective and should be approached with caution.

"  A Sustainable Urban Vision  In an increasingly urbanized world, the concept of car-free cities is gaining momentum as a revolutionary approach to re-envision urban living. These cities propose a fundamental shift away from private automobiles, either through severe restrictions or outright bans, and in doing so, they advocate for sustainable transportation alternatives and a greener, more vibrant urban environment.  Car-free cities represent a paradigm shift in urban living, focusing on sustainability, health, and community well-being. They offer a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment, but transitioning to this model is not without its unique set of challenges.  One of the key benefits of car-free cities is their potential to significantly reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. By prioritizing pedestrian and cyclist safety, these cities aim to reduce accidents and improve public health, leading to better respiratory and cardiovascular well-being for urban residents. Efficient use of urban space is a central theme in car-free cities, repurposing parking lots and wide roads into green parks, recreational areas, and pedestrian zones. This transformation revitalizes the urban landscape, enhancing the overall quality of life for city residents. Less reliance on private cars translates to reduced traffic congestion, shorter commute times, and lower stress levels for urban inhabitants. Furthermore, car ownership can be a significant financial burden, and by depending less on private vehicles, residents have the opportunity to save money on car-related expenses, improving their financial stability.  However, transitioning to car-free cities is not without its unique set of challenges. Many individuals heavily rely on their cars for daily activities and commutes, which can result in resistance to the transition due to concerns about inconvenience and a perceived loss of personal freedom. Effective public transportation is essential for the success of car-free cities, and substantial investments are required to expand and enhance public transit systems, providing convenient alternatives to private cars. Businesses that depend on car-dependent customers may experience declining revenues during the transition, necessitating solutions to mitigate the economic impact. Redesigning urban areas for car-free living is a complex and time-consuming process, requiring comprehensive planning and substantial investments in infrastructure.  To successfully implement car-free cities, solutions include expanding and improving public transportation, promoting active transportation methods such as walking and cycling, encouraging carpooling and ride-sharing, adopting electric and sustainable transportation options, and focusing on public education and awareness.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer a visionary perspective on more sustainable, healthier, and community-centric urban living. Despite the challenges, the potential benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, public health, efficient urban living, and cost savings make them a worthwhile aspiration. By investing in public transportation, promoting alternative transportation methods, and engaging the public in the planning process, cities can work toward a future where private cars are no longer the dominant mode of transportation. Car-free cities represent a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment.",1
"I think that drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any way while they are driving. It's really dangerous and it makes it way more likely that they will get into an accident. Like, imagine if you're driving and you're also trying to text your friend. You're not paying attention to the road and you might not see that car in front of you stop suddenly. Then, BAM! You crash into them and it's all because you were too busy texting. It's just not worth it.

And it's not just texting, it's also talking on the phone. Like, if you're on a call, you're still not paying attention to the road as much as you should be. You might miss a red light or a stop sign, and then you could get into an accident. It's just too risky.

I know that some people might say that it's okay to use cell phones while driving because they're really important for emergencies. But, there are other ways to handle emergencies without using your phone while driving. Like, you could pull over to the side of the road and then call for help. That way, you're not putting yourself or anyone else in danger.

So, in conclusion, drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any way while they are operating a vehicle. It's just too dangerous and there are other ways to handle emergencies. We need to make sure that everyone is safe on the road, and that means putting our phones away while we're driving.",1
"The effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on small business owners have been devastating. With shutdowns and restrictions in place to help contain the spread of the virus, many small businesses have had to close their doors indefinitely or change their operations drastically. This has led to a significant decrease in revenue for already struggling entrepreneurs who are now facing an uncertain future. Many of these small businesses were already operating on tight budgets and found it difficult to remain viable in normal economic conditions. With a sudden drop in customer demand due to social distancing measures and a lack of financial support from federal programs, many entrepreneurs have been left with no other option than closing down permanently or dramatically cutting costs just to stay afloat. As a result, hundreds of thousands of small business owners across the country have lost their livelihoods during this crisis, leaving them without income and often without any hope for recovery. The long-term implications this could have on our economy are far-reaching as these businesses can provide essential goods and services that are vital for local communities’ well being including jobs, investment opportunities, taxes revenues etc… It is estimated that more than 100 million people worldwide will be unemployed by 2021 due to covid-19 related closures making it even harder for those out of work individuals looking for employment especially within smaller organizations where job openings may be limited or nonexistent as they struggle financially themselves. Moreover, since most financial aid packages only covered short term expenses such as payroll costs instead offering any meaningful assistance with longer term challenges like debt restructuring or marketing plans; its likely that these once thriving companies will continue suffering even after government mandated lockdowns end unless additional structural changes are made quickly so they can capitalize on new customer base gained during this period before competition catches up again. . It is clear then that if we don't take direct action soon there may not be much left but devastation when we look back at what used too exist prior all this started.

"The traditional family unit has been changing significantly in recent years, and the impacts of this are both positive and negative. On one hand, there is a greater amount of diversity within families than ever before. Single parent households are no longer stigmatized as much as they used to be, making it more acceptable for parents with different backgrounds or lifestyles to raise children together without necessarily being married. This increases acceptance of all kinds of families, including LGBT+ couples who can now have children and live openly with them in certain places around the world. Likewise, it's become more common for people to ""blend"" their families by bringing step-children into a marriage or living situation between two adults who already had kids from previous relationships. These situations provide unique opportunities for caring and diverse household dynamics that weren't possible just a few decades ago due to social stigma attached to such arrangements. On the other hand, some worry that these changes may lead to less stability within some family units due to an increased likelihood of break-ups or divorce when compared with traditional nuclear families where both parents were married before having any children together. Studies have shown that single parent households tend to struggle financially at higher rates than those with two full-time working adults present – although this isn't always true anymore given how well many single mothers do today when raising their own kids alone. Additionally, blended households often require additional effort by everyone involved in order for them function properly on all levels (i.e., emotionally & psychologically). For example communication must be clear between biological parents and stepparents regarding expectations about parenting styles/discipline tactics; boundaries must also be clearly outlined so that each person feels respected even if they're not related biologically or legally through marriage/partnership agreements etc. . Overall though it can agreeably said that modern day changes towards more diverse versions of family units have resulted in far more understanding & acceptance among various types of familial dynamic scenarios which adds up positively toward overall

"I strongly agree that we have become a throw-away society. The idea of disposing of what we no longer need has become an ingrained part of our lives, and we no longer consider the consequences of our actions on our environment.

The most visible example of this is plastic bags. Plastic bags are used all over the world to carry groceries and other items, and are often thrown away when they are no longer needed. Unfortunately, plastic bags take hundreds of years to decompose, and they often end up in landfills or floating in oceans and rivers. In addition, when plastic bags are burned, they release toxic chemicals into the air, which can have damaging effects on human health.

Another example of our throw-away society is electronic waste, or e-waste. When electronic devices reach the end of their life cycle, they are often disposed of in landfills, where they can release toxic chemicals into the environment. Even if these devices are recycled, it is often done in developing countries, where workers are exposed to dangerous chemicals in the process.

Finally, our throw-away society has led to an increase in food waste. In many parts of the world, food is thrown away without any thought given to the people who are in need. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, a third of all food produced worldwide is wasted, and this leads to increased levels of methane gas in the atmosphere, which is a major contributor to climate change.

In conclusion, our throw-away society has had a devastating impact on our environment. If we want to protect our planet from further damage, we need to change our habits and start being more mindful of our actions. We need to reduce our reliance on disposable items and think about the consequences of our actions on the environment. Only then will we be able to create a sustainable future for generations to come.

"Language is an integral part of human culture, and it is a crucial means of communication. It provides people with a way to express their thoughts and emotions, and it is an essential aspect of identity. However, many of the world's lesser-known languages are at risk of becoming extinct. As fewer people speak them, these languages are gradually fading away. I strongly agree that the governments of countries in which these languages are spoken should act to prevent them from becoming extinct. In this essay, I will discuss the reasons why it is necessary to preserve these languages.

Firstly, preserving lesser-known languages is essential for cultural preservation. Each language carries with it a unique culture, and the loss of a language means the loss of the culture that it represents. Language is an essential aspect of cultural identity, and it helps shape a community's beliefs, values, and practices. Therefore, saving a language also means preserving the cultural heritage of a community. For instance, the indigenous languages spoken by tribes across the world are at risk of disappearing, and along with them, their culture may be lost forever. Thus, it is necessary to take steps to preserve these languages.

Secondly, preserving lesser-known languages is crucial for linguistic diversity. Every language is unique, and it provides a different perspective on the world. Multilingualism allows people to communicate effectively with a broader range of people and fosters a better understanding of different cultures. Moreover, linguistic diversity is vital for scientific research since it allows researchers to communicate with people who speak different languages. Therefore, by preserving lesser-known languages, we can enrich the global linguistic diversity.

Thirdly, preserving lesser-known languages is vital for the development of minority communities. Many people in these communities face social and economic challenges, and preserving their languages promotes their well-being. Language not only helps to preserve the cultural identity of these communities but also strengthens their social and economic status. Also, the ability to communicate in their language can provide the community with access to education, healthcare, and other essential services. Thus, it is necessary to preserve these languages to promote the well-being of these communities.

Finally, preserving lesser-known languages is essential for historical research. Language provides a unique window into the past, and losing a language can result in the loss of valuable historical information. For instance, many indigenous languages are oral traditions, and they carry with them stories, myths, and legends passed down through generations. Therefore, preserving these languages also means preserving the history of a community.

In conclusion, the governments of countries in which these languages are spoken should act to prevent such languages from becoming extinct. Preserving lesser-known languages is essential for cultural preservation, linguistic diversity, the development of minority communities and historical research. It is necessary to take steps to protect these languages so that they can continue to enrich human culture and provide us with valuable insights into our past. The loss of a language is a loss for all humanity, and we must work to prevent these languages from disappearing.

"Despite the fact that technology is rapidly advancing at an increasing rate, one thing remains clear; handwriting is still a fundamental skill for everyone. Handwriting can be seen as a form of expression and creativity that has many benefits, from providing more clarity and better communication to better cognitive development in children. The importance of handwriting begins with its ability to help individuals express themselves more clearly in comparison to typing out words on a computer or other device. Sequence, spacing, and emphasis are all techniques used by individuals when writing with pen and paper which allow them to convey their thoughts more effectively than if they were typing up those same words on a keyboard. For example, by underlining certain words or phrases it adds emphasis so readers have an easier time understanding what the writer is trying to communicate. Additionally using different types of lettering such as italicizing or capital letters also allows writers to communicate their message more efficiently than if they were just using standard font options available on most devices’ keyboards. Another benefit of handwriting comes into play when considering its use among children who are learning how to write for the first time. By consistently practicing this skill young minds become accustomed not only with forming letters correctly but also developing motor skills like eye-hand coordination which will serve them well through later stages in life involving drawing and even playing sports! Furthermore due to the concentration needed while physically creating characters from scratch it helps foster improved memory recall compared to simply tapping away on a laptop or tablet keys instead - both short term memory during practice sessions and long term rememberance during exams!. . It's important that we recognize how important handwriting really is - whether it be for expressing oneself clearly while communicating or enhancing cognitive development amongst kids - because without properly utilizing our pens & paper there would be no way these things could happen! We mustn't forget about this vital skill set as technology advances further into our lives otherwise we might miss out on some great opportunities provided by handwritten documents/letters etc.

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can bring numerous advantages to both individuals and the environment. By adopting a car-free or car-reduced lifestyle, communities can enjoy improved air quality, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, less traffic congestion, and better public health. This can be achieved through the development of smart planning strategies and the promotion of alternative modes of transportation.

One of the biggest advantages of limiting car usage is the positive impact on the environment. According to the passage, passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to global warming and climate change. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can greatly decrease these emissions and mitigate their harmful effects. This is particularly important for areas with high car usage, such as suburbs and cities.

In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, limiting car usage can also improve air quality. The passage about Paris implementing a partial driving ban due to smog demonstrates the detrimental effects of car emissions on air quality. By reducing the number of cars on the road, especially those with diesel engines, we can improve air quality and create a healthier living environment for residents.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in traffic congestion. The passage about the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, showcases the positive impact of such initiatives on traffic flow. By promoting alternative modes of transportation such as buses, bikes, and walking, communities can alleviate traffic congestion and create more efficient transportation systems.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can improve public health. The passage mentions how a car-reduced lifestyle can lead to lower stress levels and a happier life. This is supported by the statement from a resident of the car-free community, Vauban, who mentioned feeling happier without a car. Additionally, limiting car usage encourages physical activity through walking and cycling, which can reduce the risk of obesity and related health issues.

Overall, the advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and significant. By adopting smart planning strategies, promoting alternative transportation modes, and creating car-free or car-reduced communities, we can improve air quality, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, alleviate traffic congestion, and enhance public health. These actions are crucial for a sustainable future and the well-being of both individuals and the environment.",1
"In the age of digital communication, it has become increasingly important to find ways to effectively balance our online and offline lives. While technology offers us a plethora of conveniences such as immediate access to information and 24/7 connection with friends, family, and colleagues through social media platforms, it can be difficult to establish healthy boundaries between virtual connections and real-life interactions. One way we can begin this process is by being more mindful about how much time we spend in front of screens throughout the day. A number of studies have shown that too much screen time can lead to health problems like depression or insomnia due to lack of physical activity or an overstimulated brain from constant stimulation. It's essential for us all to set limits on our consumption of technology - whether that means putting away electronic devices during meal times or setting aside specific “tech free” days each week. In addition to limiting our own tech use, we need also focus on cultivating meaningful relationships with those around us; these are often best done when there are no distractions from phones or tablets present. Taking up hobbies such as woodworking, painting, gardening etc., not only bring joy but also provide opportunities for creative problem solving which allows us connect with ourselves better while creating something unique both physically tangible object which gives immense satisfaction unlike swiping left right on a dating app!

"There is no one answer to this question as it depends on each individual's perspective. Some people may believe that education is a life-long process that should be pursued continuously, while others may not see the need for continuous learning after they have completed their formal education.

I believe that education is a life-long process, and that it is important to continue learning and expanding our knowledge throughout our lives. This is especially true in today's world, where technology is constantly evolving and new information is constantly being released. If we stop learning once we finish our formal education, we will quickly become outdated and unable to keep up with the latest trends and developments.

In addition, I believe that education should not be limited to formal settings such as schools and universities. There are many opportunities for learning outside of the classroom, and we can learn something new every day if we are open to it. For example, we can learn about new cultures by travelling, we can learn about business by working in a company, and we can learn about history by reading books and articles.

Continuing our education throughout our lives is important because it allows us to keep up with the latest trends, it helps us to stay informed about current events, and it enables us to expand our knowledge and skills. I believe that everyone should make a lifelong commitment to learning, and that the more we learn, the more we can contribute to society.

"Saving for Retirement is an Important Part of Financial Planning. Retirement planning is a key part of financial planning and should be taken seriously. Saving for retirement should start in your 20s, but it’s never too late to begin. Even if you already have some savings set aside, it's important to identify goals and create a plan that will help ensure that you can retire with the lifestyle you desire and without unnecessary stress on your finances. One of the first steps in saving for retirement is deciding how much money to set aside each month; this decision should be based both on current finances and future plans. It's essential to have enough money saved up by the time one reaches their desired retirement age so they don't outlive their funds or struggle financially while retired. Setting small, achievable goals along the way can help make saving easier by providing motivation when things get tough; these could include gradually increasing savings percentages or reaching certain milestones such as having 3 months' salary saved up by age 30 or 6 months' salary saved up by age 40. When attempting to figure out how much money needs to be put away each month, one should consider what type of lifestyle they wish to maintain throughout retirement as well as any income sources available during those years (e.g., Social Security benefits). Taking into account inflation rates, health care costs, taxes, housing expenses (real estate taxes/insurance/maintenance), living expenses like food and utilities etc., helps provide an accurate estimate about what kind of nest egg will need to be built before retiring from full-time work life – ideally 10 times a person’s annual pre-retirement income according recent financial advice guidelines being offered today!. This allows retirees more flexibility when making decisions about spending habits upon entering retirement because there are no longer restrictions imposed due wages received from working outside jobs which serve as primary sources of income prior to leaving full-time work life behind them permanently after all!.

Staying active is a great way to reap many physical, mental, and emotional benefits. Keeping active can help to avoid boredom, as it provides an outlet for creativity and a way to make use of extra energy. Being active also encourages a healthier life; exercising increases strength and endurance, and contributes to better resistance against disease. Moreover, staying active can help individuals to achieve their goals in life. It enables them to stay focused on what’s important and to channel their energies in constructive directions. 

For instance, if an individual has a large project to complete, setting aside time to engage in physical activities will help them to stay focused and prevent distractions from impacting their progress. Alternatively, another benefit of staying active is the potential to gain recognition, which can be achieved with greater self-discipline and the dedication to follow through on commitments.

In essence, staying active offers numerous benefits. Taking the time to engage in physical activities helps to avoid boredom, encourages a healthy life, and facilitates the attainment of goals. Although they may not seem to be connected, exercising regularly and achieving success are closely intertwined. By combining the two, success is achievable in a shorter period of time. To sum up, staying active is an important part of daily life and offers remarkable benefits to those willing to make the effort.",1

Taking a four-day weekend can have a positive impact on both mental and physical health. Researchers have found that taking a break, even for a few days, can help to refuel and refresh the mind and body. For one, having an extended weekend can help to reduce stress levels from the daily pressures of work and life. This can help to restore a feeling of calm and balance which can be beneficial for physical health. Moreover, having the extra day can allow us to engage in activities we don’t otherwise have time for such as socializing with family and friends, taking the time to relax, or doing something for self-care. 

Furthermore, having a four-day weekend can have many benefits for schools, the environment, employers, and employees. For schools, it could grant students an additional day to get organized, study, or attend tutoring. Additionally, it could provide a unique opportunity for field trips or use the day for special programming. For the environment, having an extra day off could reduce fossil fuel emissions and lead to a cleaner environment. Employers and employees could also benefit from having the extra day to rest and recoup. Additionally, employers might be able to save on operational costs if the business is closed for the additional day. 

In conclusion, taking a four-day weekend can be beneficial for overall mental and physical health, schools, the environment, employers, and employees. ",1

Subject: Support for the Electoral College

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College system in the United States' presidential elections. While some argue for a change to a popular vote system, the Electoral College offers several benefits that ensure a fair and balanced representation of the American people.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. In the 2012 election, President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral vote while only obtaining 51.3% of the popular vote. This indicates that the Electoral College aligns the interests of the states and prevents a few densely populated areas from dominating the entire election process. With the current system, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College always exceeds their share of the popular vote, ensuring a clear result and avoiding disputes over the outcome.

Another important aspect of the Electoral College is that it requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. This means that a candidate cannot rely solely on the support of one particular region and must consider the interests of the entire nation. This ensures that the elected president represents the diverse needs and concerns of citizens from different regions, preventing a ""regional favorite"" from neglecting the interests of other parts of the country.

Additionally, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. Swing states play a crucial role in election outcomes as they receive the most attention and information from candidates, resulting in more thoughtful and informed voters. This system ensures that candidates have a genuine interest in engaging with and addressing the concerns of swing state voters, ultimately improving the overall quality of the campaign.

The Electoral College also preserves the weight of larger states in the political balance. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, as decreed in the Constitution, already favors smaller states. By considering both population and state size, the Electoral College balances the representation of both large and small states. This way, presidential candidates are incentivized to pay attention to the needs and concerns of both populous states like Florida and smaller states like Wyoming, ensuring a more equitable distribution of attention and resources.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for complicated run-off elections. Under this system, a candidate who wins the majority of electoral votes becomes the clear winner, eliminating the need for further rounds of voting. This prevents political instability and ensures a smooth transition of power.

While critics argue that the Electoral College may discourage voters in states where their preferred candidate has no chance of winning, the numbers from the 2012 election indicate that eligible American voters are motivated to express their political preferences regardless of the impact on the national outcome. The Electoral College system has not hindered citizen participation in the democratic process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College offers several advantages that promote a fair and balanced presidential election. It ensures a clear outcome, encourages trans-regional appeal, focuses on swing states, balances representation between large and small states, and avoids the complexity of run-off elections. For these reasons, I urge you to support the continuation of the Electoral College system in our country. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

"As education is a vital aspect of a child's development, it is crucial that parents are involved in their children's education. Volunteering time to their children's schools can have numerous benefits, such as improving the quality of education and strengthening the parent-child relationship. Therefore, I agree that all parents should be required to volunteer time to their children's schools.

Firstly, volunteering time to the school can help improve the quality of education. Teachers are responsible for teaching a large number of students, and as a result, they may not be able to provide individual attention to each child. Parents can help fill this gap by volunteering to assist the teacher in the classroom. For example, they can help students who require additional support, help with class projects, or provide additional assistance to the teacher. This can help to reduce the workload of teachers and improve the quality of education provided to the children.

Secondly, volunteering time to the school can help to strengthen the parent-child relationship. When parents volunteer at their children's school, they can gain a better understanding of their child's strengths and weaknesses. This can help parents to identify areas where their child may require additional support and help them to address these issues. Additionally, volunteering provides parents with an opportunity to spend quality time with their children and engage in activities that they may not have the opportunity to do otherwise. This can help to build a stronger bond between the parent and child.

Moreover, volunteering time to the school can help parents to stay informed about their child's progress. When parents volunteer, they can interact with their child's teacher and gain insight into their child's academic and social progress. This can help parents to identify areas where their child may need additional support and work with the teacher to address these issues. Additionally, volunteering provides parents with an opportunity to participate in school activities and events, allowing them to stay informed about school policies and procedures.

However, some may argue that requiring parents to volunteer may be an unfair burden on them. Some parents may have work or other commitments that may prevent them from volunteering. However, schools can offer flexibility in volunteering opportunities to accommodate parents' schedules. For example, schools can offer weekend or evening volunteering opportunities, allowing parents who work during the day to volunteer at their convenience.

In conclusion, requiring parents to volunteer time to their children's schools can have numerous benefits, such as improving the quality of education and strengthening the parent-child relationship. While some may argue that it may be an unfair burden on parents, schools can offer flexibility in volunteering opportunities to accommodate parents' schedules. Therefore, I believe that all parents should be required to volunteer time to their children's schools.

"The traditional Chinese practice of not telling cancer patients the truth about their diagnosis is coming under increasing scrutiny in the modern world. Some people argue that this practice must be changed in order to align with modern values. I believe that there are valid arguments on both sides of this issue, and that the decision of whether or not to tell a cancer patient the truth about their diagnosis should be made on a case-by-case basis.

There are a number of reasons why some people believe that cancer patients should always be told the truth about their diagnosis. First, they argue that it is a fundamental human right to know the truth about one's own health. Second, they argue that cancer patients need to be able to make informed decisions about their treatment. And third, they argue that not telling the truth about a cancer diagnosis can cause unnecessary stress and anxiety for both the patient and their family.

There are also a number of reasons why some people believe that cancer patients should not always be told the truth about their diagnosis. First, they argue that the truth can be too much for a cancer patient to handle. Second, they argue that cancer patients often have a better quality of life if they do not know the truth about their diagnosis. And third, they argue that not telling the truth about a cancer diagnosis can sometimes be in the best interests of the patient's family.

I believe that the decision of whether or not to tell a cancer patient the truth about their diagnosis should be made on a case-by-case basis. In some cases, it may be in the best interests of the patient to know the truth. In other cases, it may be in the best interests of the patient to not know the truth. The decision should be made based on the individual circumstances of each case.

The digital age has changed the landscape of interpersonal relationships and provided us with a multitude of tools to communicate in a wide variety of ways. While these tools have enabled us to connect with friends and family from around the world, technology has also had some negative effects on relationships as well. A major issue lies in the amount of time that is devoted to and is lost with social media. Spending too much time on social networks such as Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook can have a significant impact on relationships. It can create a disconnect between people by replacing face-to-face contact with virtual interaction. Furthermore, individuals may find themselves more comfortable confiding in social media apps rather than discussing their problems with their friends in person. Finally, the reliance on technology can lead to a lack of basic social skills such as active listening and reading body language; skills that form a vital part of forming and maintaining relationships. The overreliance on technology in the digital age is having a negative effect on interpersonal relationships, and it is important to establish a balance for our own well-being and the well-being of those around us.",1
"When it comes to achieving success in school, time management is key. Many high school and college students struggle with managing their time effectively, leading to missed deadlines, incomplete assignments, and lower grades than they could have attained. In order to make sure this doesn't happen, there are a few simple strategies that any student can use to maximize their productivity while studying. First of all, creating a schedule is essential for good time management. It should be made the night before or at least the morning of the day ahead so that you know exactly what tasks need doing each day and when they need completing by. This will allow you to plan your study sessions around other activities accordingly without feeling overwhelmed or having too little time each day for everything that needs done. Another tip for effective time management is removing distractions from your workspace or study area such as phones and music players as these can easily draw away attention from working successfully on an assignment or studying for a test. Disabling notifications on social media apps may also help since one notification can often lead down a rabbit hole of procrastination - leaving much less done than anticipated!. Lastly but certainly not least important is taking regular breaks throughout long periods of work which helps refresh both mind and body allowing us to stay focused longer instead of burning out quickly over extended hours spent at our desks alone!. . . Overall while it seems like quite a daunting task at first glance – proper time management is something anyone can master with practice; making sure we get good rest along with staying organized every step in-between leads us towards better results academically & professionally alike no matter what field we end up pursuing after our schooling years come to an end!

Subject: Support for the Electoral College as a Vital Component of Presidential Elections

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College as an essential process for the election of the President of the United States. While some argue in favor of changing to a popular vote system, I firmly believe that retaining the Electoral College is crucial for ensuring fairness, regional representation, and political stability in our presidential elections.

The Electoral College, established by our founding fathers as a compromise between election by Congress and a popular vote, comprises 538 electors. These electors are crucial in the selection of the President and Vice President, as they represent their respective states' interests in the electoral process, offering a balanced approach to electing the President.

One of the significant advantages of the Electoral College is its ability to provide certainty of outcome. As Judge Richard A. Posner points out, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote, minimizing the likelihood of a disputed outcome. This ensures a smooth transition of power and prevents potentially chaotic situations that could arise if the popular vote were the sole determining factor.

Additionally, the Electoral College fosters national representation and prevents regional dominance. By requiring a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College ensures that no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This encourages candidates to campaign in different states and appeal to a broader range of voters. With the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes, candidates prioritize swing states, thereby engaging a more diverse electorate and preventing the disregard of certain regions' interests.

Furthermore, the Electoral College balances the influence of big and small states, giving appropriate weight to each. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, which benefits small states, is counterbalanced by the Electoral College. Presidential candidates are incentivized to pay attention to states of varying sizes, ensuring that voters from both small and large states receive due consideration during electoral campaigns. This balance of representation favors a more equitable and inclusive democracy.

Finally, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. In instances where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner. This reduces the potential complications and expenses associated with run-off elections, thereby maintaining the efficiency and effectiveness of the presidential election process.

It is important to remember that the Electoral College encourages voter participation, even for those residing in states that often lean heavily towards one party or another. Despite the perception that their votes may not have a significant impact on the national result, approximately half of the eligible American population still exercises their right to vote. Voters are driven by their desire to express their political preferences and contribute to the democratic process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a necessary process that upholds the principles of fairness, regional representation, and stability in presidential elections. It ensures certainty of outcome, guarantees national representation, promotes balance between big and small states, and avoids run-off elections. By preserving the Electoral College, we can uphold the values and traditions established by our founding fathers while ensuring a robust and inclusive democratic process.

I urge you to consider the merits of the Electoral College and advocate for its retention. Thank you for your attention to this important matter.

"The importance of physical activity in the life of a teenager cannot be overstated. For teenagers, staying physically active is essential for maintaining a healthy lifestyle and developing strong habits that will set them up to lead healthier and happier lives well into adulthood. Physical activity can provide numerous benefits to teenagers, both mentally and physically. Physically, it helps promote weight management by burning calories while strengthening bones, improving flexibility and endurance. Regular exercise also improves cardiovascular health by decreasing the risk of heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure and diabetes—all diseases that may persist throughout adulthood if not addressed during teenage years. In addition to its physical benefits, physical activity has been known to reduce stress levels as it increases endorphins or “feel good” hormones within the body which can improve moods overall with regular practice . It also provides an opportunity for teens to build relationships with their peers as they engage in team sports or group activities which promotes communication skills as well as social development . Despite these clear advantages associated with physical activity for teenagers , many adolescents find themselves leading sedentary lifestyles due to busy schedules filled with schoolwork combined with extracurricular activities like music lessons or volunteer work. To combat this issue , parents must make efforts towards encouraging their teenage children to stay active whether through traditional sports teams or other forms such as yoga classes , martial arts seminars , dance recitals etc. Also ensuring easy accessility encourages increased participation; having quality gym facilities available closeby makes more likely than not that teens will be less likely discouraged from participating because of distance constraints thus making it easier for them get involved in some form of exercise on a regular basis .

"I believe that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.

Unfortunately, first impressions don’t always go well. However, research shows that open minded people and the willingness to give second chances can often help to change a bad first impression. 

As an example, consider the story of an American investor who visited a foreign company with which she was looking to establish a business relationship. During the visit, the investor mispronounced one of the company’s names, which caused many of the members of the staff to become offended. Despite the unfavorable impression, the company’s director chose to show understanding for the innocent mistake and offered the investor the benefit of a second chance. The director’s open-mindedness about the mispronunciation signaled to the investor that her careless error would not interfere with the potential business relationship. Ultimately, the investor and the foreign company were able to develop a long-term, successful partnership. 

Another example is a young, high-achieving student who was applying to college. During his initial interview, the student made several mistakes and created a chaotic atmosphere. Not only did the student misspell words during his presentation, but he was not able to recall important details from his past experiences. However, the interviewer simply reminded the student to relax and view the exercise as an informal conversation. From that point on, the student was able to loosen up and give the interviewer the information and anecdotes necessary to create an accurate and impressive impression. 

It is clear that open-mindedness and second chances offer the opportunity to change a bad first impression. The examples of the investor who was able to create a successful business relationship and the student who was given the chance to improve his college interview both demonstrate the power of a second chance. With the right attitude and a little understanding, many unfavorable first impressions can transition into favorable ones.",1

"The field of artificial intelligence is a rapidly growing, highly competitive industry. While it has been around since the 1950s and has seen numerous advancements in recent years, the technology is still relatively new and presents many opportunities for businesses to capitalize on. Artificial intelligence (AI) plays an increasingly important role in our lives, ranging from performing mundane activities like scheduling meetings to carrying out complex tasks such as medical diagnosis or financial analysis. With these increasing capabilities come both tremendous potential and serious ethical considerations regarding privacy and misuse of data. The AI market holds great promise for global economic growth over the next decade. According to some estimates, AI-based products and services could contribute up to $15 trillion per year by 2030 – more than double what it was estimated at just five years ago. This contributes significantly to overall GDP growth worldwide due to its ability to automate repetitive tasks that are usually done manually today; improve customer experiences; aid decision makers with real-time insights; help reduce costs associated with labor; uncover investment opportunities quicker through big data analytics tools; increase efficiency when processing large amounts of information; detect fraud faster by using predictive analytics models; save resources that would be expended if manual processes were used instead of automation solutions utilizing algorithms driven by machine learning etc.,. The possibilities are endless!. However, there remains much work needed before we can realize these benefits fully without fear of unintended consequences or malicious exploitation. For example, even though automation powered by AI can eliminate human error caused by fatigue or lack of focus while completing certain tasks (i.e., driving), they might also introduce blind spots into areas where careful consideration needs to be taken instead (such as medical diagnoses). In addition, due care must always be taken when dealing with sensitive personal information related to customers’ private details including banking records or health histories stored within databases connected directly via APIs into other applications employed in day-to-day operations respectively – all this requires legislation tailored for protecting such data whenever/wherever necessary whilst

Having a good attitude is one of the most important factors for leading a happy and successful life. It can make or break a person's experience in the highly competitive environments of school or work. Studies show that having a positive attitude helps to maximize a person's potential and increases performance. For example, many athletes cite their positive attitude as one of the contributing factors to their success. A good attitude can also lead to greater success in relationships, as demonstrated by research that has found correlation between having a positive outlook and experiencing satisfying relationships.

On the other hand, although having a good attitude most of the time can bring many benefits, it can be detrimental in certain situations. For instance, when faced with challenging tasks, having a too positive outlook can lead to an unrealistic estimation of one's ability to accomplish the task. This can cause disappointment and diminish motivation.

"Every day, Americans face the same dilemma: how to manage their time. Time management is an important skill that everyone must master in order to make the most of their lives, but it can be difficult to learn and implement into your daily routine. Fortunately, there are various strategies that can help people become more organized and efficient with their schedules. First and foremost, it's essential to get a good handle on what tasks need completing as well as roughly how long each task should take you. This includes both small projects like doing laundry or making dinner as well larger goals such as getting caught up on work emails or scheduling a doctor’s appointment. Writing these down helps provide clarity on what needs attention so nothing gets forgotten or overlooked in favor of bigger tasks at hand. Additionally, breaking large tasks down into smaller chunks allows for better focus which makes them easier to complete quickly. Additionally, creating detailed plans is also helpful when trying to stay organized and productive throughout the day. Having access to a calendar—whether paper-based or digital—can help greatly by providing an overview of all upcoming events in one place so nothing slips through the cracks and everything remains accounted for effectively. Writing out specific tasks along with due dates can reduce stress levels because you know exactly what needs doing before when it needs done by instead leaving open ended assignments that don't have clear deadlines set ahead of time tends lead feeling neurotic about keeping track of progress mentally which leads procrastination not wanting do anything until last minute then ending rushing finish job unsatisfactory results from lack effort concentration put towards project . Finally, setting realistic expectations for yourself goes hand-in-hand with having clear plans laid out ahead of time; allowing yourself enough cushion between different commitments prevents stress from piling up while still allowing room for spontaneity (like going out after work rather than saying no every chance).

"Dear Senator [Name],

I am writing as a concerned citizen to present an alternate perspective on the debate concerning our longstanding method of electing our presidents: the Electoral College. While the electoral college system has its opponents, I believe it is important for us to acknowledge and appreciate the value this model holds for our democracy, especially considering its capacity to bring about certainty of outcomes, enable trans-regional appeal, and encourage focus in campaigns.

The electoral college process, as outlined by the Office of the Federal Register, is a foundation agreed upon by our founding fathers and has been instrumental in the peaceful transition of power throughout our nation's history. The system, as noted by Judge Richard A. Posner in his defense of the Electoral College, offers reasonable assurance of a certain outcome. The winner-take-all approach means even a small margin of victory in a state can translate to a landslide in electoral votes, reducing the likelihood of disputes over the election outcomes.

Furthermore, the Electoral College compels presidential candidates to accrue trans-regional appeal. They cannot solely focus on one region as no single region possesses the electoral vote quantity to secure a presidency. Consequently, our presidential hopefuls must work to address issues relevant to a broad spectrum of citizens across the country, thereby offering representation to multiple demographics and regions.

Moreover, the Electoral College facilitates the focus of campaigns on swing states. This amplifies the impact of the most attentive, discerning voters, and rallies campaigning efforts. Whilst Bradford Plumer in 'The Indefensible Electoral college' argues that the “winner-take-all system” disadvantages states with certain voting outcomes, I believe it's the attentiveness of voters in swing states that assigns gravity to these votes.

Admittedly, the Electoral College isn't a flawless construct, and the system has had some infrequent hiccups, like the 2000 situation where the candidate with more popular votes lost the presidency. However, as Judge Posner asserts, such scenarios are rare exceptions rather than the norm.

I urge you, Senator, to contemplate the strengths inherent in our electoral system before rushing to a consensus as radical as abolishing the Electoral College. While it may seem appealing to transition to a popular vote system, it is important to consider the unforeseen challenges that such a shift might present. Continuous improvement and evolution should undoubtedly be part of our democratic process, but so should preservation of elements that have proven to function well in ensuring the democratic representation of our nation's diverse population.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

"If you are a fan of music, then the role that jazz has played in American culture is worth exploring. Jazz originated in New Orleans during the late 19th century and has since become one of America's most beloved musical genres. Through its combination of improvisation, polyrhythms, syncopation and swing rhythms it provided a unique sound to contrast with popular European styles such as classical or romantic music at the time. Since then, jazz’s influence on American culture can be seen everywhere from movies to advertisements to political campaigns. Jazz has had an immense impact on American art forms due to its versatility and willingness for experimentation. On the more technical side musically speaking, jazz laid down foundations for modern day rock & roll through its improvisational style and use of minor keys along with influences from blues music; without these elements many classic rock songs would not exist today! In terms of film score composition too jazz was revolutionary – composers could take advantageof dynamic instrumentations like saxophones or electric guitars which when combined with swinging tempos gave scenes an exciting energy unseen before in other movie scores. It also found great success amongst visual artists who sought out its sophisticated melodies as background accompaniment while they worked or exhibited their works – Jackson Pollock famously painted works backed by Charlie Parker records!. The socio-political implications that this genre possesses cannot be overstated either -not only did it provide African Americans a platform to express themselves against discrimination but it served as an example for greater cultural integration between different backgrounds within society at large– coming together under shared love for this melodic form made people recognize each other as less distant than they previously assumed prior!. This message was especially prevalent during civil rights movements across America where musicians used their talents both lyrically and structurallyto make powerful statements about equalityand justice that resonated deeply throughout communities .

"Technology has undeniably made life more convenient. From being able to communicate with friends and family anywhere in the world, to being able to shop for groceries and clothes without ever having to leave our homes, technology has made our lives much easier.

However, many people would argue that life was actually better when technology was simpler. For example, many people would say that the days of having to use a typewriter or a pen to communicate are long gone. Instead, we now have technology such as email and text messaging that allow us to communicate quickly and easily.

Furthermore, many people would argue that the days of having to go to a physical store to purchase items are also behind us. Instead, we can now purchase items online or in stores that are located near us. This is a huge convenience for many people, as it allows them to save time and money.

Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide whether they believe that life was better when technology was simpler or more convenient. However, based on the arguments presented, it is clear that technology has made our lives much easier and more convenient.

"Drug addiction is an insidious affliction that can have devastating effects on a person's life. It can lead to serious mental and physical health problems, as well as financial hardship and social isolation. While it may seem impossible to overcome this disease, there are treatmentsavailable that provide hope for those suffering from drug addiction. One of the most effective treatments available for drug addiction is inpatient rehabilitation programs. These intensive residential treatment centers offer comprehensive therapy sessions aimed at helping individuals gain control over their substance abuse issues. During these programs, patients develop coping skills to help them address underlying causes of their addictions such as emotional distress or trauma from past experiences. Programs also integrate structure and routine into a patient’s daily life with organized activities like group counseling, individual therapy sessions and attending 12-step groups facilitating long-term recovery success rates . In addition to inpatient rehab programsthere are other types of treatments available including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT helps individuals identify thought patterns that lead to addictive behavior and teaches them how to change their responses in order to better manage stressors without turning back towards drugs or alcohol again. Medication assisted therapies (MAT) such as methadone clinics allow people struggling with serious opioid dependency access the treatment they need while providing necessary medication subsidies which enable clients maintain stable recovery paths while reducing cravings associated with withdrawal symptoms when attempting sobriety alone . Finally, one important factor for successful recovery lies within the support system surrounding each individual struggling with this condition .

Having a successful business takes more than just good ideas and hard work. Numerous factors come into play, including external factors such as the economy, which can dramatically affect a business's success. It is therefore important to consider all possible reasons why a business could fail and devise a plan to help business owners come up with ideas to ensure success. Furthermore, those who experience failure can find solace in the stories of successful people who overcame their struggles and rose to success. A great example of this is Winston Churchill, who despite suffering many disappointments and failures in his lifetime, managed to make a huge contribution to society. This illustrates the importance of perseverance and continuing to pursue goals despite any setbacks. Equally, an effective support system is essential for those going through difficult times, providing emotional and physical assistance to those who need it.",1

In today's world, many people use cell phones as a part of everyday life. But is it safe to use cell phones while driving? This is a topic of much debate. In this essay, I will discuss my opinion on whether drivers should be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle.

(First paragraph)
I think drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones in any capacity while driving. Cell phones can distract the driver, and that could lead to an accident. It only takes a split second of being distracted to get into an accident. Even just answering a call or sending a text can be dangerous as it causes the driver lose focus. It is better to be safe than sorry.

(Second paragraph)
Some people argue that hands-free devices are safer to use while driving, but I disagree. Using Bluetooth or speakerphone can still be distracting. The driver has to take their attention off the road and focus on the call instead. This can be just as dangerous as using a handheld device. So I think it's better to avoid using any device while driving.

(Conclusion)
In conclusion, I believe that using cell phones while driving should be prohibited. The risks are too high to justify it. Even a small distraction can cause a terrible accident, so why take the chance? The best way to keep yourself and others safe is to focus on the road and avoid any distractions. It is important to remember that a cell phone call or text message can always wait until you are not behind the wheel of a vehicle.",1
"I wholeheartedly agree with the sentiment that education is expensive. The consequences of a failure to educate, especially in an increasingly globalized world, are even more expensive.

One of the most significant costs associated with a lack of education is the lost economic potential of a country or region. A country or region with a large population of illiterate or poorly educated citizens is at a disadvantage in the global marketplace. This disadvantage can be especially pronounced in industries such as manufacturing, where the need for skilled workers is critical.

In addition to lost economic potential, a poorly educated populace also poses a threat to the safety and security of the nation. A poorly educated population is more likely to be susceptible to exploitation by criminals and terrorists. In addition, a poorly educated population is less likely to be able to participate fully in the democratic process, which can lead to the abuse of power by elected officials.

Finally, a lack of education can have a negative impact on the quality of life of citizens. Poorly educated citizens are more likely to be unemployed or underemployed, which can lead to poverty and social isolation. In addition, poorly educated citizens are more likely to be victims of crime and abuse, which can lead to feelings of insecurity and vulnerability.

All of these costs are significant and deserve our attention. We should do everything we can to ensure that all our citizens have the opportunity to obtain a quality education.

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my opinion regarding the current debate surrounding the Electoral College and its role in the election of the President of the United States. As a concerned citizen, I believe that the Electoral College should be maintained, and I would like to present several reasons to support my stance.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures a certain degree of certainty in the outcome of the presidential election. While disputes over the popular vote can and have occurred, such conflicts are less likely in the case of the Electoral College. This is due to the fact that the winner's share of the Electoral College votes typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. With the majority of states using a winner-takes-all system, the chances of a nationwide tie in the Electoral College votes are highly unlikely.

Furthermore, the Electoral College promotes a sense of unity and representation for all regions of the country. By requiring a candidate to have trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College prevents a situation where one particular region has enough electoral votes to single-handedly elect a president. This system ensures that a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be successful, as they would not be able to effectively represent the interests of the entire nation. It encourages candidates to campaign in a wide range of states, making them accountable to the concerns and needs of citizens across the country.

In addition, the Electoral College system emphasizes the significance of swing states. By focusing campaign efforts on these states, candidates are able to directly engage with voters who hold considerable influence in deciding the election. This leads to a more informed and thoughtful electorate, as citizens in swing states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and critically evaluate the competing candidates. The ability of swing states to determine the outcome prevents the presidency from being determined by a few densely populated areas while disregarding the concerns of citizens in other parts of the country.

Moreover, the Electoral College provides a fair balance between large and small states. The differential allocation of electoral votes based on population gives larger states a greater say in the election process. This ensures that candidates cannot solely focus on the needs of smaller, less populous states at the expense of larger ones. The Electoral College system recognizes that a state's size should be taken into account when considering its influence on the national level.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for runoff elections. Since the winning candidate must secure a majority of electoral votes, the system guarantees a clear winner. This avoids the complexity and potential division that would arise from additional rounds of voting if no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote.

While critics argue that the Electoral College can disenfranchise voters in states where their preferred candidate has no chance of winning, it is important to remember that individuals who vote in presidential elections typically do so to express their political preferences. The fact that not every vote swings a national election does not diminish the significance of individual citizens participating in the democratic process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College serves as a vital component of our democratic system and should be maintained. It provides certainty in the outcome of the election, ensures representation and unity across regions, promotes informed voting through swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and eliminates the need for runoff elections. The Electoral College system may not be perfect, but it strikes a balance that preserves the integrity of our national elections.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my perspective on this matter. I trust that you will carefully evaluate the arguments presented and make decisions that best serve the interests of our nation and its citizens.

Sincerely,

"Education is a process of acquiring knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes that help individuals to lead a successful life. Some people believe that education is a life-long process, while others disagree. In my opinion, education is a continuous process that lasts throughout an individual's life. In this essay, I will explain why I believe that education is a life-long process.

Firstly, education is not limited to the classroom. Learning can happen anywhere and at any time. For example, a person can learn new things by reading books, watching documentaries, attending seminars, or even by having conversations with others. These activities can help individuals to broaden their knowledge and gain new perspectives on various topics. Therefore, education is not just limited to formal schooling but is a continuous process that can happen throughout an individual's life.

Secondly, the world is constantly changing, and new technologies, ideas, and concepts are emerging every day. To keep up with these changes, individuals need to continue learning and updating their knowledge and skills. For instance, a person who works in the field of technology needs to keep up with the latest advancements to remain competitive in the job market. Similarly, a doctor needs to keep up with the latest medical research to provide the best possible care to their patients. Therefore, education is a life-long process that helps individuals to stay relevant and competitive in their respective fields.

Lastly, education is not just about gaining knowledge and skills but also about personal growth and development. Through education, individuals can develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making skills, which are essential for success in life. Education also helps individuals to develop a sense of self-awareness, empathy, and social responsibility, which are important for building strong relationships and contributing to society. Therefore, education is a life-long process that helps individuals to grow and develop as human beings.

In conclusion, education is a life-long process that lasts throughout an individual's life. It is not limited to formal schooling but can happen anywhere and at any time. Education helps individuals to stay relevant and competitive in their respective fields, and it also helps them to grow and develop as human beings. Therefore, it is essential to continue learning and updating our knowledge and skills throughout our lives.

"The importance of learning to budget cannot be overstated. In today’s increasingly expensive world, it is becoming more and more important for people to develop effective budgeting strategies in order to achieve their financial goals. It is not just a matter of being able to buy the things they want; having an understanding of how much money they have, where it goes each month, and what potential savings can be made are all essential components of successful budgeting. One key benefit of knowing how to manage your finances through budgeting is that you will ultimately make better decisions about spending your money wisely. Knowing exactly how much money comes in every month – and where it must go - helps you prioritize expenses so you are able to pay bills on time and avoid late fees or penalties that could occur from missed payments. Additionally, by recognizing when there is extra room in the budget for fun items such as trips or entertainment, this lets you enjoy life without going into debt unnecessarily. Budgeting also allows individuals greater control over their short-term and long-term financial goals like saving for college tuition or retirement funds. By staying focused on these objectives rather than impulse buying with credit cards or taking out loans large amounts of debt can often be avoided while reaching those dreams quicker than would otherwise be possible. Furthermore, if unexpected medical costs arise or financially difficult times come up due to job loss then having a preplanned emergency fund via careful spending habits can provide an invaluable cushion should hard times come around unexpectedly yet again later down the road. . In conclusion, creating an effective monthly budget plan provides many advantages both now and into the future that help individuals become financially independent no matter what stage they may currently find themselves at in life’s journey. The rewards from developing good fiscal practices early on will carry forward throughout one's entire lifetime providing security for years ahead even amidst ever changing economic climates around us all!

"The ever-changing landscape of modern day education is a topic that has been met with much debate and discussion. With the advances in technology, the need for traditional classrooms to remain static is becoming increasingly outdated. There are many pros and cons to this idea, yet it remains an important factor in determining how students can best be prepared for future success. One major benefit that comes from having a more dynamic educational system is increased focus on individual learning styles. By diversifying lesson plans and making them available through different mediums such as video lectures or interactive websites, students have greater access to tailored instruction based on their own needs and abilities rather than being required to learn through one standard method. Additionally, this allows instructors to explore new teaching techniques outside of their comfort zone in order to provide additional support where needed while also allowing room for innovation in the classroom environment itself - something which often becomes stagnant when relying solely on textbook lessons alone. Furthermore, a more adaptive school setting encourages problem solving skills by challenging students with real-world scenarios instead of relying solely on theoretical knowledge being taught by rote memorization methods. This kind of critical thinking helps develop valuable life skills while introducing them quickly within innovative projects meant to excite their minds without sacrificing quality educational content along the way. In essence, these types of activities encourage creativity whilst still providing educational value; something which may not always be feasible within rigid settings determined largely by curriculum boards or state mandates. Overall, modern education offers distinct advantages over its traditional counterparts due primarily because its expansive nature offers flexibility across multiple areas including topics explored as well as learning methods utilized throughout any given course or program - both paramount elements in producing successful graduates ready for further exploration into college or other professional programs upon completion . It’s clear why so many educators today are beginning to embrace this concept: pushing boundaries results in pushing progress towards bettering our overall academic system – something we should all strive for if society hopes ot continue advancing forward into an ever

First impressions are difficult to shake, but not impossible. Everyone has had experiences where their first impression of someone has changed over time. For instance, when I first met my manager at work, I was unsure of how she would react to my ideas. She seemed distant and I was hesitant to voice my thoughts. Over time, however, I got to know her better and she opened up to me. I eventually learnt that her distant demeanor was only her way of being professional. Now, I respect her as someone who values hard work.

Another example of how my initial impression of someone had changed was when I met my best friend. At first, I thought she was too judgemental and was wary of making friends with her. However, as I got to know her better, I began to appreciate her for her honest and direct personality. Now, she is one of my closest friends.

Technology has become an integral part of modern living, and it is difficult to ignore the multitude of ways it has improved our lives. People who are physically limited by their lack of mobility, speech, or hearing can now access communication, information, and services without the limitations of a physical world. Online shopping, for instance, provides an immense convenience that wasn’t available before; buying a book without leaving your house is now a reality. Furthermore, technology has enabled us to connect with people from around the world, allowing us to communicate with near-instantaneous speed. 

Although technology has brought about great strides in our lives, it is important to consider the downsides of this progression. With more communication and information readily available, the value of human contact can be lessened. Face-to-face conversations are becoming more scarce, and the consequences of this could be severe. It is important to learn how to properly utilize technology and its features so that human contact and communication are not lost. 

Ultimately, there is little argument against the fact that technology has had an overwhelmingly positive effect on both our personal and professional lives. It enables us to communicate across long distances in mere seconds and has made the world feel ever-so-slightly smaller. However, it is important to recognize the danger of overreliance and remember that technology is a resource and a tool — one that should be used intelligently and with consideration for its consequences.",1

Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

In recent years, there has been a growing trend in limiting car usage in various parts of the world. This movement, known as ""smart planning,"" aims to separate suburban life from auto use and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The advantages of limiting car usage are significant and include improved air quality, reduced traffic congestion, and greater reliance on public transportation.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the environmental benefit it brings. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions, especially in car-intensive areas. In Europe, passenger cars alone account for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. By reducing car usage, we can significantly decrease the amount of carbon emissions released into the atmosphere, thus helping to combat climate change.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to improved air quality. This is evident in the case of Paris, where a partial driving ban was enforced to clear the air of smog. The ban resulted in a 60 percent decrease in congestion and a significant reduction in air pollution. Similarly, the city of Bogota in Colombia implemented a car-free day, which led to the streets being devoid of traffic jams and reduced smog levels. By limiting car usage, we can create cleaner and healthier environments for both current and future generations.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of traffic congestion. In many cities around the world, traffic congestion is a major problem that causes frustration and wastes valuable time. By encouraging alternative modes of transportation such as walking, cycling, and public transit, we can alleviate traffic congestion and improve the overall flow of traffic. This is exemplified in German suburb Vauban, where giving up cars is the norm. The result is car-free streets and a peaceful atmosphere where bicycles and pedestrians have precedence. By limiting car usage, we can create more efficient and less congested roadways.

Limiting car usage also promotes greater reliance on public transportation. When suburbs are designed with the concept of smart planning in mind, they are made more compact and accessible to public transportation. Stores are placed within walking distance, and amenities are located on main streets instead of distant malls. This approach encourages people to use public transportation instead of relying solely on personal vehicles. It also makes public transportation a more attractive and convenient option for daily commuting. The success of this approach is evident in Vauban, where 70 percent of families do not own cars and public transportation is readily available.

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and significant. By reducing car usage, we can improve air quality, reduce traffic congestion, and promote the use of public transportation. This not only benefits the environment but also enhances the overall quality of life for residents. It is clear that limiting car usage is an essential step towards creating sustainable and livable communities.",1
"Giving back to the community is one of the most important things an individual can do. It helps create a sense of responsibility and ownership, and it can have a positive impact on the people around us.

Unfortunately, young people nowadays seem to be less involved in their communities than in the past. There are a number of reasons for this.

First of all, young people are more focused on themselves than on others. With the advent of social media, young people are constantly bombarded with images of their peers living what appear to be perfect lives. This can create a sense of envy and entitlement, and cause young people to focus on their own lives rather than on the lives of others.

In addition, many young people are under a lot of pressure to succeed. They are told that they need to get good grades, get into a good college, and get a good job. As a result, they often don’t have time to volunteer or get involved in their communities.

Finally, many young people simply don’t see the point of giving back to their communities. They may not be aware of the needs of their community, or they may not think that their help would make a difference.

Despite these reasons, it’s important for young people to get involved in their communities. There are a number of ways to do this.

One way is to volunteer for a local organization. This can be a great way to learn new skills and make new friends. In addition, it can help young people to understand the needs of their community and see the difference that they can make.

Another way to get involved is to participate in community events. This can be anything from a neighborhood cleanup to a food drive. Participating in these events can help young people to feel more connected to their community and to make a positive impact.

Finally, young people can simply be more mindful of the needs of their community. They can take the time to talk to their neighbors, learn about the issues their community is facing, and find ways to help.

Giving back to the community is important for young people. It can help them to develop a sense of responsibility and ownership, and it can have a positive impact on the people around them. There are a number of ways for young people to get involved in their communities, and it’s important for them to take advantage of these opportunities.

"There is no doubt that degree certificates are becoming increasingly important in our society. Many employers look for candidates with a graduate degree and promotions are often based on this criterion. While it is true that a degree certificate reflects only one's academic achievements, I believe that it is not the only ability essential for a successful career.

There are many other qualities that are important in the workplace, such as teamwork skills, communication abilities, and critical thinking skills. In fact, many employers now place greater emphasis on these qualities than on academic qualifications. For example, I know a woman who is a highly successful lawyer, and she has only a Bachelor's degree.

There are many other examples of people who have achieved success without a graduate degree. Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, never completed his college education. So I believe that it is wrong to say that a degree certificate is the only ability essential for a successful career. There are many other qualities that are important, such as creativity, determination, and risk-taking ability.

When it comes to having someone attempt to make drastic changes to our personalities, it can be a difficult and often confusing topic. On one hand, it can be helpful to learn from others how to be more understanding, or to appreciate a different perspective. On the other hand, if someone is trying to pressure us to be something we are not, it can bring about negative consequences.

It is important for all of us to remember that we all bring something unique to the table. We should not feel ashamed to express our individual views and experiences in a respectful manner. Furthermore, we should try to accept the differences between us, whether we agree or not, to foster healthy relationships. 

At the same time, being open to constructive criticism is beneficial. We all have areas in our lives we could work on or need guidance; a person who offers feedback or suggestions in a kind and patient manner should be seen as an ally. Attempting to better ourselves should be appreciated, though we should be wary of someone wanting us to change just so they are comfortable. 

Ultimately, it is best to strive for a balance between embracing new insights while also preserving our core identity. We need to be accountable for how we conduct ourselves but not necessarily cave into the demands of another person. ",1
"It is widely believed that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. While it is true that there has been a decline in civic engagement among young people compared to past generations, there are a number of reasons why this is not necessarily true. Young people are increasingly committed to helping out their local communities and lending a hand in different charitable activities.

When it comes to volunteering, young people are relatively active compared to their older counterparts. According to a recent survey conducted by the Corporation for National and Community Service, volunteering among young adults aged 16-24 is on the rise, with the numbers of volunteer hours increasing by 11% compared to the previous year. This indicates that young people are engaging in volunteering and community service activities.

Moreover, young people are increasingly demonstrating their commitment to their local communities by engaging in philanthropic activities. According to a 2017 study published in the journal Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly, millennials are the most generous age group when it comes to donating money. Although millennials are not donating large amounts of money compared to previous generations, they are still donating significant amounts, and this demonstrates their commitment to supporting their local communities.

Furthermore, young people are also engaged in local initiatives that help their communities. For instance, many young people are involved in initiatives such as community clean-up days, initiatives to reduce plastic waste, or programs to support small businesses. These initiatives show that young people are willing to take the initiative to help their local communities and make a difference.

In conclusion, it is not true that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. Though there has been a decline in civic engagement among young people compared to previous generations, young people are still demonstrating their commitment to their local communities through volunteering, donating, and taking part in local initiatives. Therefore, we should recognize their contribution and support them in their efforts.

"The importance of exercise and physical activity in maintaining a healthy lifestyle cannot be overstated. As the pandemic has necessitated an increased focus on work-from-home environments and social distancing, it is more important now than ever to make sure that our bodies are kept in good shape and health. Exercise not only helps maintain physical wellbeing but also mental health as well, providing us with much needed endorphins, balance, and stress relief. For those who live sedentary lives or lack motivation to get started with an exercise routine, low impact activities such as walking and yoga can offer many benefits without the need for a gym membership or specialized equipment. Taking regular walks during the day provides fresh air, sunshine exposure if outdoors (which is crucial for Vitamin D production), and mild cardio while helping clear our minds from any built up anxiety or stress. Moreover, walking can even have positive implications on productivity due to its ability to increase circulation throughout the body while stimulating cognition which may lead to creative problem solving skills when combined with focused thought. Yoga is another great way of staying active without putting too much strain on the body but still getting all the benefits associated with exercise: improved flexibility, strength building through core muscles used during various poses like downward dog or plank hold; cardiovascular endurance obtained from dynamic flow sequences; relaxation through mindfulness meditation; plus restoring energy levels both physically and mentally. The latter can aid in calming nerves before giving presentations by instilling greater self confidence - something especially useful for those who must attend virtual meetings daily where attention spans tend towards decreased effectiveness since we’re not engaging face-to-face with others as we would typically do at usual gatherings/workshops/conferences etc . .

"When considering the potential of renewable energy sources, it is important to consider the unique benefits of solar power. Solar power has been an area of research for many years and its potential as a clean and reliable form of energy production has long been recognised. The use of this type of energy offers numerous advantages over traditional methods, including reduced emissions, lower costs and greater reliability in areas with limited access to other forms of electricity generation. The primary advantage offered by solar power is the reduction in emissions associated with its generation; since no fossil fuels are burnt during its operation there are significantly less greenhouse gases being released into the atmosphere than traditionally generated electricity would produce. This makes it much more environmentally friendly than alternative means, making it attractive to those who wish to reduce their carbon footprint or help reduce global warming. Coupled with this reduction in air pollution are also economic benefits due to not having to buy fuel from outside sources – once installed, solar panels can provide free electricity for decades without any additional cost apart from maintenance fees. Another great benefit when utilizing solar panels for home or business use is the increased reliability that comes from using them versus grid-tied systems; rather than relying on a single source like traditional electrical networks do, photovoltaic cells allow users to generate their own independent supply which helps ensure constant availability even if connection problems occur elsewhere within society’s infrastructure framework. Furthermore, these types of systems have around 30% better efficiency meaning fewer cells need be used per installation which limits overall capital expenditure requirements allowing homeowners/businesses more flexibility when budgeting for this type setup compared against other solutions such as wind turbines etc. Finally although initial costs may seem high, incentives such as tax credits along with decreases in component prices (thanks largely due technological advances) mean that while still significant they can now often be recovered within only a few years instead five or ten - greatly reducing payback timescales triggered by installing new equipment at a given location/site thus helping

"While cell phones have become an integral part of modern life, using a cell phone while driving can seriously endanger safety on the road. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity when operating a vehicle.

There are a few key reasons why cell phone use while driving should be prohibited. First and foremost, distracting activities like talking or texting on a phone take a driver's eyes off the road and mind off their main task - safely navigating the vehicle. Numerous studies have shown that even hands-free calling can impair reaction times and decision making while driving. When every second counts to avoid an accident, any distraction from focus on one's surroundings poses an unacceptable risk. 

Secondly, cell phone use while driving puts not only the user but others on the road in danger. One wrong move such as veering into another lane or running a red light due to distraction could have catastrophic consequences and seriously injure or kill innocent people. As operators of heavy machinery that can cause harm, drivers have a responsibility to maintain fully attention on the task of driving at all times. 

Finally, prohibiting cell phone use except in emergency situations establishes a clear standard that helps change driver behavior for the better. With cell phone use now banned in many places, drivers learn not to rely on their phones when navigating traffic. They can focus fully on arrival safely without endangering lives. While access to communication technologies is important, it should never come at the cost of human life and safety on public roads. In emergencies like responding to breakdowns or accidents, phones may be used, but for general use they have no place in the driver's seat.

In conclusion, any kind of cell phone use provides too much of a distraction from the critical task of driving. Lives are at stake with each vehicle on the road. To protect all citizens from potential harm, drivers should not have access to cell phone functions of any kind except in real emergencies. Public safety must take priority over any convenience cell phones provide, and a total ban offers the safest standard for our roads.",1

"There is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on the individual. Some people believe that speaking English is more important for Chinese learners, while others believe that reading is more important. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to decide which skill they feel is more important.

One reason why reading is more important for Chinese learners is that it provides a foundation for learning English. Reading allows students to understand English words and phrases, which is important for learning how to speak English. Additionally, reading can help students develop vocabulary, which is important for speaking English.

Another reason why reading is more important for Chinese learners is that it is a more efficient way to learn English. Reading takes longer than speaking, but it is ultimately worth the investment because Chinese learners can learn more English words and phrases in a shorter amount of time.

Finally, speaking English is more important for Chinese learners because it is the primary language used in the Chinese education system. Chinese learners who do not speak English can still benefit from learning English, as it is a necessary skill for many jobs in China.

"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Introduction:
Limiting car usage is an idea gaining traction around the world as a means to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the adverse effects of pollution. This essay will explore the advantages of limiting car usage based on the information presented in the passage set.

Body Paragraph 1: Reduced Greenhouse Gas Emissions
One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars are responsible for a considerable portion of these emissions, with Europe attributing 12 percent and some car-intensive areas in the United States up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions to automobiles (Passage 5). By promoting alternatives to car ownership and usage, communities can contribute to a significant reduction in carbon footprints and combat climate change effectively.

Body Paragraph 2: Improved Air Quality
Limiting car usage also has a direct positive impact on air quality. In Paris, for example, a partial driving ban was enforced due to severe smog, resulting in a 60 percent reduction in congestion and a noticeable improvement in air quality (Passage 14). This measure demonstrates that reducing car usage, even temporarily, can have an immediate and tangible benefit in terms of cleaner air. Implementing similar initiatives in other cities can significantly improve public health by reducing respiratory illnesses caused by pollution.

Body Paragraph 3: Increased Accessibility to Public Transportation
Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of alternative means of transportation, such as public transit. The German suburb of Vauban, where cars are generally forbidden, exemplifies this approach (Passage 2). By designing communities with proximity to public transportation systems, residents have greater accessibility and are more likely to utilize buses, trams, and trains. This shift can result in decreased traffic congestion, reduced carbon emissions, and improved mobility for individuals who may not have access to private vehicles.

Body Paragraph 4: Enhanced Quality of Life
Limiting car usage also offers an improved quality of life for residents. In Vauban, where a majority of families have given up car ownership, residents reported feeling less stressed and happier (Passage 3). The absence of cars creates a quieter and safer environment, encouraging more active modes of transportation, such as walking and biking. Additionally, proximity to essential services, like stores and amenities, promotes a sense of community and fosters healthier lifestyles.

Conclusion:
The advantages of limiting car usage are evident in various communities worldwide. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, promoting alternative transportation options, and enhancing the quality of life for residents, limiting car usage can contribute significantly to a sustainable and vibrant future. Governments, city planners, and individuals must rally behind these methods, adopting smart planning principles and prioritizing people-centered development to ensure a cleaner, healthier, and more accessible environment for all.",1
"Sports have always been a great way to bring people together. It is a universal language that transcends borders, cultures, and languages. Sporting events such as the World Cup have the potential to reduce tension and bias between different countries and promote peace in the world. In my opinion, I strongly agree with this statement, and I will explain my reasons in the following paragraphs.

Firstly, sports have the power to unite people from different backgrounds and cultures. When people come together to support their national team, they forget about their differences and focus on their shared love for the game. For example, during the 2018 World Cup, fans from all over the world came together to support their teams. They shared their passion for the game, and this helped to reduce tension and bias between different countries.

Secondly, sports can be used as a tool for diplomacy. Sporting events provide an opportunity for countries to come together and engage in friendly competition. This can help to build relationships and promote understanding between different nations. For example, during the 2018 Winter Olympics, North and South Korea marched together under a unified flag. This was a significant moment that helped to reduce tension between the two countries.

Finally, sports can help to promote peace by providing a positive outlet for people's energy and emotions. When people are passionate about something, they are less likely to engage in negative behaviors such as violence and aggression. Sporting events provide a safe and controlled environment for people to express their emotions and release their energy. This can help to reduce tension and promote peace in the world.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that sporting events such as the World Cup can help to reduce tension and bias between different countries and promote peace in the world. Sports have the power to unite people from different backgrounds and cultures, promote diplomacy, and provide a positive outlet for people's energy and emotions. As such, we should continue to support and promote sporting events as a means of promoting peace and understanding in the world.

"Dear Senator [Your Senator's Last Name],

I write to you today to express my thoughts on a pressing issue: the method by which we elect our President. Specifically, I implore you to rally support for maintaining the often-debated Electoral College system.

Our country's founding fathers established the Electoral College as a compromise between Congressional election of the President and direct popular vote (Federal Register). They carefully considered the balance between majority rule and protection against mob rule, creating a system to enable broader representation across our diverse nation. Indeed, keeping the Electoral College ensures that between our densely-populated urban areas and sparsely populated rural states, no area’s needs and rights are wholly ignored.

Critics argue that the system is undemocratic, as the President is technically elected by electors, not directly by the individuals (Plumer; Posner). It is true that the system can lead to an outcome where the candidate with the most popular votes nationwide does not win the election, as seen in the year 2000. However, this phenomenon has been exceedingly rare overall.

Detractors also point out the potential for Electoral College crises, including faithless electors, and an electoral tie leading to the House of Representatives determining the election result (Plumer). Yet these situations have been relatively infrequent and largely resolved without causing lasting harm to our democratic processes.

The Electoral College also resolves issues such as what could potentially happen when no candidate receives a majority of votes cast, thus avoiding the need for complicated run-off elections (Posner). More importantly, it forces presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal, as no single region holds enough electoral votes to secure a victory. This compels candidates to understand and consider the needs of diverse areas across the country, making the eventual winner ""everyone's President"" (Posner).

Admittedly, the system is not perfect. The focus on swing states during the election campaigns leaves some citizens feeling ignored and potentially disinterested in voting (Plumer; Posner). However, as Posner notes, even in a system of popular vote, no single vote ever truly swings a national election.

I urge you, Senator, to deeply consider these points. The Electoral College is an invaluable mechanism that ensures a balanced, fair representation of all states in our presidential elections. It encourages candidates to appeal to a diverse range of constituents and minimizes the complexity of run-offs. This unique system, while not perfect, is deeply embedded in the democratic structure and tradition of our nation.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

"Have you ever been to the beach and watched the magnificent sunset? As you sit on the warm, sandy shoreline with your toes sinking in, a dazzling array of pinks and oranges fill up the sky like an artist's painting. The sun slowly dips down as its golden rays stretch out across the horizon, sending out its last goodbye for another day. Watching a beautiful sunset at the beach is one of life’s simple pleasures that never fails to make us pause from our busy lives and appreciate nature’s beauty. One moment stands out amongst my travels to various beaches around the world – watching a breathtakingly beautiful sunset in Costa Rica. I was standing near Playa Avellana while waiting for my friends when I spotted it - vibrant oranges mixed with soft pinks radiating through wispy clouds hovering above an endless blue ocean beneath them. It almost looked unreal yet so real at once; how could something be so captivating yet fleeting all at once? I stood there in awe for several minutes until reality brought me back: “Hey! What are you doing? We’re ready to go!” My friends had arrived but all I wanted was stay just few moments more and absorb this magical view before leaving it behind forever. The beauty of these sunsets is that they come with no expectations or obligations attached other than enjoying their presence right then and there without worrying about what comes next or if circumstances will change; instead just appreciating each moment as precious gift because we can never get them back again. These brief moments remind us not only of our mortality but also how important it is take time away from our hectic schedules now and then just let ourselves be filled by nature's magic while watching ethereal displays of color dance across an infinite night sky during golden hour times. As humans, we are so lucky to experience such gorgeous creations made by Mother Nature every single day – particularly those seen from atop beautiful beach settings

"In today’s society, few topics are as important or controversial as the ethics of animal testing. Animal testing is a practice used in scientific research by which animals are subjected to various experiments for the purpose of understanding complex biological processes. Many people believe that animal testing should be banned altogether due to its inherent cruelty and ethical implications, while others argue that it's necessary for medical progress. However, both sides can agree on one thing: proper regulation of animal testing is critical if it must continue. In order to understand why regulation is so essential when it comes to animal testing, we first have to look at why scientists use animals in their experiments in the first place. The primary reason behind this practice lies with the fact that animals share many similar physiological systems and genetic makeup with humans; thus making them ideal test subjects for studies into new treatments and medicines aimed at helping better human health outcomes. Scientists also use animal models because they are cheaper than conducting clinical trials directly on humans and provide more control over variables such as diet and environment – something impossible with human test subjects who have individual external factors affecting their health. The issue arises when standards governing these tests aren't properly maintained by researchers or institutions performing them – resulting in unacceptable levels of unnecessary suffering inflicted upon animals being tested upon without any meaningful benefit gained from their ordeal. To prevent this situation from occurring again, there needs to be stricter regulations surrounding how these tests are conducted; including closer monitoring of research protocols used during experiments by external organizations (such as government agencies). Additionally, emphasis must also be placed on further reducing our reliance on live animal experimentation through increased investment towards alternative methods such as computer simulations or 3D tissue cultures where possible – allowing us to still gain access to vital medical knowledge without having perform unethical practices on living creatures needlessly. All-in-all, although there may not always be an easy way forward when addressing ethical issues related to practices like animal testing; finding ways ensure humane treatment for our

Since the dawn of time, people have realized the immense benefits of helping others. By participating in community service, students gain valuable skills and learn more about their community. But, some argue that this should not be a requirement for students, stating that it is too much work. 

On the one hand, community service is a good way for students to develop important skills such as communication, problem solving, and collaboration. It can also lead to improved student engagement and higher success levels since students are actively involved in their community. Moreover, service activities provide a great way to learn more about the world around them and how they can make a difference.

On the other hand, opponents to mandatory community service argue that it is a burden for students, taking away valuable time that could be spent studying or doing other activities. Additionally, it can be a challenge for students to find community service opportunities that align with their interests and that provide meaningful experiences. 

Ultimately, I believe that requiring students to participate in community service can be beneficial--not only teaching students valuable skills, but also providing them with an opportunity to make a positive impact on their community. By mandating community service, students have the opportunity to contribute to their local community in meaningful ways.",1
"In the coming 20 years, cars will become less popular as ride-sharing and autonomous vehicles become more widespread. This trend is already visible in the declining ownership of cars among young people.

There are many reasons why cars will become less popular in the next two decades. For one, autonomous vehicles will become increasingly common. This technology will make it easier and more affordable for people to get around without having to own a car.

Another reason why cars will become less popular is the rise of ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft. These services make it easy for people to get around without having to worry about parking or traffic. They are also more affordable than owning a car.

Finally, the increasing cost of gasoline and the growing awareness of the environmental impacts of cars are also contributing to the trend of declining car ownership.

All of these factors suggest that cars will become less popular in the next two decades. This trend is already visible in the declining ownership of cars among young people. As autonomous vehicles and ride-sharing services become more widespread, we can expect this trend to continue.

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College system and to argue against changing to a popular vote for the election of the President of the United States. While I understand that there are valid concerns about the Electoral College, I believe that it serves an important purpose in our democracy.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome. As stated in the text by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that disputes over the outcome of an Electoral College vote are less likely than disputes over the popular vote. In fact, a tie in the nationwide electoral vote, although possible, is highly unlikely due to the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes in most states.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system ensures that the president has trans-regional appeal. No single region of the country has enough electoral votes to elect a president, which means that candidates must have broader appeal and address concerns of voters from different regions. By requiring a candidate to have support from various regions, the Electoral College prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from becoming president, which would likely result in a feeling of disenfranchisement among residents of other regions.

The system is also beneficial in focusing campaign efforts on swing states. As mentioned in the text, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus their campaigns on states where the outcome is uncertain. This ensures that voters in these states pay close attention to the candidates and make informed decisions about their vote. These thoughtful voters, who often receive the most information and attention from the candidates, should be the ones to decide the election.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it provides a balance of power between large and small states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, as decreed in the Constitution, gives small states an advantage in terms of representation. By allocating electoral votes based on population, the Electoral College restores some weight to larger states in the political balance. The popularity of a candidate in a large state can influence the outcome of the election to a greater extent than in a small state, ensuring that the concerns of residents in these larger states are not overlooked.

Lastly, the Electoral College system helps avoid run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, the Electoral College ensures that a clear winner emerges. This eliminates the need for further complicated run-off elections, streamlining the presidential election process.

While critics argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters for candidates who have no hope of carrying their state, the fact remains that a significant portion of the eligible population still votes in presidential elections. People participate not because they believe their single vote will swing the entire election, but because they want to express their political preference.

In conclusion, the Electoral College plays a crucial role in our democracy and should be retained. It ensures certainty of outcome, requires candidates to have trans-regional appeal, focuses campaign efforts on swing states, provides a balance of power between large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While improvements can always be made, changing to a popular vote system would have its own set of challenges and unintended consequences. Therefore, I urge you to support the continuation of the Electoral College system.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will carefully consider the arguments presented and make an informed decision.

Taking some free time to relax and break away from a work or school task can have both beneficial and detrimental effects on achieving individual goals. Studies have indicated that, when managed carefully, taking breaks throughout the day can significantly improve productivity for those working in busy environments. Furthermore, workers who take regular breaks tend to remain more engaged in their tasks while having an improved ability to recall and recall information. On the other hand, too much inactivity can lead to decreases in productivity and motivation and can make it more challenging to complete tasks in a given amount of time. 

The importance of effective time management when trying to accomplish a goal cannot be overstated. Planning out a schedule and setting aside designated periods of time to complete tasks can help keep idle time to a minimum and ensure that progress is being made. Having a daily to-do list and breaking tasks up into smaller, more manageable pieces can also help increase overall productivity and allow for more free time during the day. By implementing effective time management strategies, individuals can maximize their potential and reach their fullest potential.",1

One of the most controversial topics to discuss in the education system is the degree to which schools should control the involvement of extracurricular activities. The pros and cons of having schools control every aspect of extracurricular activities must be considered. On the one hand, there are significant benefits to having schools set strict regulations and enforce strict guidelines. Through this, schools can provide students with a safe and secure environment in which to explore and engage in new activities. Moreover, it ensures that the activities offered are of the highest quality, allowing students to really get the most out of their experience.

On the other hand, overly controlling the extracurricular activities available to students can have a negative impact on students. By limiting the opportunities available to students, schools may limit student creativity and exploration. Students may be discouraged from pursuing activities that may not be officially recognized by the school, but that could still have an enormous benefit to them. Additionally, students may become frustrated by the unnecessary restrictions imposed on them, which could lead to a lower sense of self-confidence or a decrease in academic performance.

Overall, it is important for schools to carefully consider their approach to extracurricular activities, as there are both benefits and drawbacks to having a high level of control over what is offered to students. Ultimately, a balance must be struck between providing students with a safe and secure environment and giving them the freedom to explore and create. By doing this, the educational experience of each student can be enriched and improved.",1
"I think that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. I think that they should more carefully consider how they can help their own communities and how they can make a difference. I have several specific examples to support this belief.

First, young people should be more carefully considering how they can help their own communities. They should be more aware of the opportunities and challenges that their communities face and the ways in which they can help. They should also be more careful about what they say and do that could help their communities.

Second, young people should make a difference in their own communities. They should be more careful about what they say and do that could make a difference in the lives of their friends, family, and neighbours. They should also be more careful about what they do not say and do that could have a negative impact on their communities.

Overall, I think that young people should more carefully consider how they can help their own communities and make a difference. I think that this will help to create more positive and productive communities.

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the matter of whether to keep the Electoral College or change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. After carefully considering the information from multiple sources, I strongly believe that the Electoral College should be maintained. Although there are valid counterarguments for changing to a popular vote, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome, ensures that every region is represented, encourages candidates to focus on swing states, gives weight to larger states, and prevents run-off elections.

One of the key reasons to maintain the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. While disputes over the Electoral College vote are possible, they are less likely than disputes over the popular vote. This is because the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. The winner-take-all system of awarding electoral votes in most states, where even a slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral vote victory, reduces the likelihood of a tie in the nationwide electoral vote.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that a presidential candidate has trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, which encourages candidates to campaign across the country and appeal to diverse regions. This prevents candidates with only regional appeal from being elected and ensures that every region feels represented.

Additionally, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. In a close election, candidates concentrate their attention on the states that are most likely to determine the outcome. This leads to increased voter attention and engagement in those states, as voters feel that their votes will have a significant impact on the election. The thoughtful and informed voters in swing states should be the ones to decide the election.

Moreover, the Electoral College restores balance to the political weight of large states. Due to the malapportionment of the Senate, large states have less influence in the political process. The Electoral College provides a platform for presidential candidates to pay attention to larger states, as winning a large state garners more electoral votes compared to winning a small state. This ensures that the concerns and interests of residents in large states are not disregarded.

Lastly, the Electoral College helps avoid the need for run-off elections. With the Electoral College, a candidate who wins a majority in the Electoral College becomes the clear winner, regardless of their plurality in the popular vote. This eliminates the possibility of prolonged election procedures and complications that would arise from run-off elections.

While it can be argued that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states where their preferred candidate has no chance of winning, the overall impact is minimal. The turnout in presidential elections is already high, with about half of the eligible American population voting. Voters participate to express their political preferences rather than in hopes of swinging a national election outcome.

In conclusion, the Electoral College should be maintained as it provides certainty of outcome, guarantees representation for every region, encourages candidates to focus on swing states, gives weight to larger states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While there are valid arguments for changing to a popular vote, the benefits of the Electoral College outweigh those arguments. Thank you for considering my perspective on this important issue.

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my position on the question of whether to keep the Electoral College or switch to a popular vote for the election of the President of the United States. After reviewing the information from various texts, I believe that the Electoral College should be retained. While there are arguments to be made for a popular vote system, the Electoral College provides several important benefits that outweigh the potential drawbacks.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome. In the Electoral College system, the winning candidate's share of the electoral votes usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that a dispute over the outcome of an election is less likely compared to a direct popular vote system. The winner-takes-all method of awarding electoral votes in most states also creates landslide victories, reducing the possibility of a tied national electoral vote. This certainty of outcome helps maintain stability and avoids prolonged disputes and uncertainty following elections.

Secondly, the Electoral College encourages candidates to have trans-regional appeal. Because no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, candidates must appeal to voters across different states and regions. This requirement ensures that the president has broader support and considers the interests of different regions of the country. Without the Electoral College, candidates with strong regional appeal could win the popular vote by focusing solely on their strongholds, potentially leaving other regions feeling disenfranchised and ignored.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it gives greater attention to swing states. In a winner-takes-all system, candidates concentrate their campaign efforts on toss-up states, where the outcome is uncertain. This focus ensures that voters in these states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, leading to a more informed and thoughtful electorate. By giving greater weight to the concerns and interests of these swing states, the Electoral College ensures that the most thoughtful voters have a significant say in the election.

Additionally, the Electoral College restores some balance to the political influence of large states. While the Senate already provides some degree of balance between large and small states, the Electoral College further ensures that presidential candidates pay attention to the concerns of larger states. In the Electoral College system, winning a small state by a slight margin may provide fewer electoral votes compared to winning a large state by the same margin. This motivates candidates to consider the needs and issues of larger states in their campaigns.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the issue of run-off elections. In situations where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, run-off elections can complicate the election process. The Electoral College guarantees a clear winner by rarely allowing a candidate to win the electoral vote without securing a majority of the popular vote. This avoids the need for further elections and ensures a smoother transition of power.

While it is true that the Electoral College may discourage some voters in non-competitive states from participating, the overall voter turnout in presidential elections remains high. This suggests that voters are motivated to express their political preferences, regardless of their state's electoral outcome. Additionally, efforts can be made to promote engagement and increase voter turnout in all states, regardless of their electoral competitiveness.

In conclusion, despite the criticism that the Electoral College has received, it provides crucial benefits that should not be overlooked. From ensuring certainty of outcome to promoting trans-regional appeal and preventing run-off elections, the Electoral College serves an important role in our democracy. While there may be merits to the arguments in favor of a popular vote system, the advantages of the Electoral College outweigh the potential drawbacks. Therefore, I urge you to support the retention of the Electoral College.

Thank you for considering my viewpoint on this important issue. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on the matter.

"There is no single answer to the question of whether or not education is a life-long process. Some people believe that there is always something new to learn and that no one is ever really done with their education. Others believe that the purpose of education is to give people the skills they need to be successful in life, and once they have those skills, they are done.

I believe that education is a life-long process. I think that there is always something new to learn, and that it is important to keep learning throughout our lives. One reason for this is that the world is constantly changing. The skills that we need to be successful today may not be the same skills that we need tomorrow. In order to keep up with the changing world, we need to keep learning.

Another reason why I believe that education is a life-long process is because it helps us to stay mentally healthy. Learning new things helps to keep our minds active and engaged. It helps us to stay curious and interested in the world around us. When we are constantly learning new things, it helps to keep us young and vibrant.

There are definitely benefits to continuing our education throughout our lives. However, it is not necessary for everyone. Some people may reach a point where they have learned all they need to know. Others may not have the time or the resources to continue their education. It is important to find what works best for each individual and to make sure that everyone has access to the education they need.

Subject: In Support of the Electoral College

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and to share my reasons for opposing a change to a popular vote system for the election of the President of the United States.

The Electoral College, as established by the founding fathers, serves as a compromise between the election of the President by Congress and a direct popular vote. It consists of a process where electors are chosen based on the number of members in their state's Congressional delegation, including Representatives and Senators. Each candidate running for President has their own group of electors, who are generally chosen by their political party.

One of the key advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. Unlike a direct popular vote, the Electoral College system ensures a clear winner, as the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. This reduces the likelihood of disputes over the election outcome, as seen in the 2000 election. Additionally, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in each state, incentivizing candidates to campaign nationwide and appeal to a diverse range of voters.

Furthermore, the Electoral College promotes the idea of a unifying President who represents all regions of the country. As no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a President, candidates need to have trans-regional appeal. This ensures that the President takes into account the interests of all regions, preventing the feeling of disenfranchisement among residents in regions that may not be strongholds for a particular candidate.

The Electoral College also gives significance to swing states, allowing for a more focused and meaningful campaign. Candidates are encouraged to concentrate their efforts on states where the election outcome is uncertain, ensuring that voters in these states receive more attention and information about the candidates' policies and plans. This fosters engagement and informed decision-making among voters in swing states.

Additionally, the Electoral College provides balance between small and large states. While the mal-apportionment of the Senate can lead to a disparity in representation, the Electoral College guarantees that all states have a voice and influence in the presidential election process. Large states receive more attention from candidates due to their higher number of electoral votes, ensuring that their concerns and priorities are not overlooked.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This saves time, resources, and potential complications in the election process. History has shown that the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner, even in cases where a candidate has only achieved a plurality of the popular vote.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system provides several benefits and serves as a vital component of our democracy. It ensures a clear and certain outcome, promotes a unifying President who represents all regions, encourages meaningful campaigning in swing states, provides balance between small and large states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. For these reasons, I urge you to consider the advantages of the Electoral College and advocate for its preservation.

"The Facial Action Coding System is a new technology that can read people's emotions. It's like a computer program that looks at your face and knows how you're feeling. Some people think it's a good idea to use this technology in classrooms to see how students are feeling. But I don't think it's a good idea.

First of all, it's kind of creepy. Imagine a computer watching you all the time and knowing exactly how you feel. It's like Big Brother is always watching you. And what if the computer gets it wrong? What if it thinks you're sad when you're really just bored? Or what if it thinks you're happy when you're really just angry? That could be really confusing and make things worse.

Second, this technology could be used to punish students who aren't paying attention or who are acting out. Like, if a student is daydreaming, the computer might think they're bored and the teacher might get mad at them. But maybe the student is just thinking deeply about the lesson and isn't bored at all. The computer wouldn't know the difference.

Also, this technology could be a distraction. If students know they're being watched, they might start acting differently just to see what the computer will do. Like, they might make funny faces or try to trick the computer into thinking they're feeling something they're not. That would be a waste of time and take away from the lesson.

Finally, I think it's important for students to learn how to express their emotions in a healthy way. If a computer is always reading their emotions, they might not learn how to do that. They might rely on the computer too much and not learn how to understand their own feelings.

In conclusion, using the Facial Action Coding System in classrooms is not a good idea. It's creepy, could be used to punish students unfairly, could be a distraction, and might keep students from learning how to understand their own emotions. We should focus on teaching students how to express their emotions in a healthy way, not relying on a computer program to do it for us.",1
"In today's world, it is important to have discussions among people with different points of view, as it allows progress to be made in every field. I completely agree with the statement that progress is best made through discussions among people who have contrasting points of view, and I believe that this can be seen in many different aspects of life. 

Firstly, in the field of science, the importance of having discussions among people with different points of view cannot be overstated. In scientific research, it is essential to analyze the results from various perspectives to understand the limitations of the research and to make improvements for future research. A great example of this is the development of the COVID-19 vaccine. Scientists with different expertise, knowledge, and perspectives worked together to develop the vaccine. Without various perspectives and opinions, scientists would have found it hard to develop an effective vaccine within a short period, and the world would still be grappling with the pandemic.

Secondly, in politics, it is crucial to have a diverse representation of voices and opinions to make the best decisions for the country. In a democracy, people of various backgrounds, cultures, and political beliefs come together to make decisions that benefit society. A good example of this is the debate over climate change. Both sides of the debate have different views, and it is through discussions that people can consider both sides and make informed decisions. When people with contrasting views come together to discuss issues, they have the opportunity to learn from one another and find ways to compromise.

Moreover, in business, discussions among people with different points of view can improve the quality of products and services. In today's world, businesses operate in a global environment, and the diversity of customers is vast. Therefore, it is essential to have a diverse workforce that can provide different perspectives and ideas. For instance, product development teams are composed of people with different backgrounds, cultures, and experiences. This approach can help businesses to generate new ideas, which may have been overlooked otherwise.

In addition, discussions among people with contrasting points of view can help individuals grow intellectually and personally. By having conversations with people who have different perspectives, individuals can expand their knowledge and perspectives on various subjects. This approach can help individuals to develop empathy and understanding for others who may not share their opinions. This is particularly important in today's world, where people are divided by various issues, and it is important to find common ground.

Finally, discussions among people with different points of view can help reduce prejudice and discrimination. When people who have different opinions come together, they can learn from each other and find ways to appreciate diverse cultures and beliefs. This approach can help to reduce the level of discrimination and prejudice that exists in society.

In conclusion, I strongly agree that progress is best made through discussions among people with contrasting points of view. This approach helps to promote diversity, understanding, and empathy, leading to better decision-making, intellectual growth, and the reduction of prejudices and discrimination. In today's world, it is essential to have conversations with people who have different perspectives and opinions, as this helps to generate new ideas and approaches to solving problems. Therefore, it is crucial to encourage discussions among people with different points of view, as this is the key to progress in every field.

"Competition is an essential part of life, and it can push us to strive for excellence. However, when it comes to children, cooperation should be emphasized over competition. Cooperation can teach children valuable life skills such as teamwork, communication, and empathy. Moreover, it can create a positive and supportive learning environment that fosters growth and development.

To begin with, cooperation teaches children to work together to achieve a common goal. In today's world, success is not just about individual achievement but also about the ability to collaborate with others. By learning to cooperate, children can develop a sense of responsibility towards their peers and community. This sense of responsibility can help them become valuable members of society who work towards the betterment of their community.

Furthermore, cooperation can foster communication skills in children. When children work together, they learn to express their thoughts and ideas clearly and effectively. They also learn to listen to others' ideas and opinions, which can help them develop empathy towards others. In contrast, competition can create a hostile environment where children feel threatened by their peers and are less likely to share their ideas or collaborate.

Finally, cooperation can create a positive and supportive learning environment that fosters growth and development. When children feel supported by their peers, they are more likely to take risks and try new things. They are also less likely to feel discouraged by failures and setbacks, as they know that their peers are there to support them. In contrast, competition can create a stressful environment where children are more focused on winning than learning and growing.

In conclusion, while competition has it's benefits, cooperation is more important when it comes to children's education and development. Cooperation can teach children valuable life skills such as teamwork, communication, and empathy. It can also create a positive and supportive learning environment that fosters growth and development. Therefore, it is essential to emphasize cooperation over competition in children's education.

"When it comes to holiday greetings, many people are inclined to go with electronic cards in lieu of paper cards. This is due to the fact that electronic cards are supposedly more environmentally friendly, as they do not require the use of paper to produce them. However, many people feel that electronic cards do not have the same flavor as paper cards and do not display the same function. For example, paper cards can be used as a bookmark, while electronic cards are not as versatile. Additionally, paper cards can be personalized, while electronic cards generally are not.

While there are some advantages to electronic cards, there are also a number of disadvantages. For example, electronic cards are often less customizable, which can make them less personal. Additionally, electronic cards are often less durable than paper cards, which can lead to them being lost or damaged over time. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to decide whether they prefer electronic cards or paper cards for their holiday greetings.

Attitude is often described as “the lens through which we view the world.” Indeed, having a positive attitude can significantly improve our daily lives, from the way we approach the workplace to the way we handle relationships. It is no wonder that so many prominent figures throughout history have highlighted the importance of developing a positive outlook—including Benjamin Franklin, who famously said, “The Constitution only guarantees the American people the right to pursue happiness. You have to catch it yourself.” 

What makes a positive attitude the key to success is its role in personal motivation. For example, a study from the University of Michigan showed that students with a positive attitude about taking a tough math course achieved better results than students with negative attitudes, regardless of their level of intelligence or King’s College London tested the effect of “positive thinking” on athletes and found that successfully imagining the act of completing a task can increase motivation.

In our professional and personal lives, having a positive attitude can open the doors of opportunity. This is because positive thinking leads to optimism, which can improve quality of work, thus making us more appealing to employers or allowing us to achieve our goals. 

Positive attitude is undoubtedly a key to success. With resilience and conviction, any individual can develop the necessary skills and knowledge to become successful, but it is the attitude that makes them shine. A positive attitude can show employers and colleagues the state of our mental health and resilience towards challenges, making it easier for us to take the steps towards a brighter future.",1
"When it comes to holiday greetings, there are some people who advocate for the use of electronic cards instead of paper cards. They claim that electronic cards are more environmentally friendly and that they do not produce as much waste as paper cards. Others argue that electronic cards do not have the same flavor of paper cards and do not display the same function.

There are a few reasons why electronic cards may not have the same flavor as paper cards. First, electronic cards often use a smaller font than paper cards, which may make them harder to read. Second, electronic cards are often stored electronically, which may reduce their lifespan. Last, paper cards often have a handwritten message on them, which may be more special and sentimental to some people.

In conclusion, whether or not electronic cards have the same flavor as paper cards is a personal preference. Some people enjoy the feel of paper cards in their hands, while others find the electronic versions easier to use and more convenient.

"Education is one of the most important aspects of our lives. When it comes to education, there are a variety of methods that can be used to effectively teach students in K-12 classrooms. Providing effective instruction for students often involves using both traditional and innovative teaching strategies that help reach learners from different backgrounds and learning styles. One example of an effective teaching strategy involves utilizing technology within the classroom. Technology such as interactive whiteboards, projector screens, laptops or tablets can give visual aids to help explain concepts more clearly while also engaging students in their learning experience. This type of technology allows teachers to display images and videos easily which helps break down complex topics into smaller chunks that are easier for students to understand. Additionally, teachers can use educational apps on these devices which provide supplemental activities like quizzes and simulations to reinforce their lesson plans. It has been found through research that incorporating this type of technology into classrooms increases student engagement levels while still providing them with adequate knowledge across all subject areas. Another approach towards effective teaching strategies is differentiated instruction where teachers create customized lesson plans based on the needs and abilities of individual students in the classroom instead of following a one-size-fits-all approach when delivering content material . Through this method, educators assess each student’s strengths and weaknesses before creating personalized lessons tailored around developing those skills so they may develop academically at their own pace without feeling overwhelmed by large amounts information being presented all at once . By allowing learners autonomy over how they learn best ,this technique allows them feel secure knowing what's expected from them each day during class time . The combination between incorporating new technologies along with differentiated instruction provides powerful tools for helping K-12 educators offer better quality education towards their pupils in the classroom setting today . Implementing these methods not only ensures successful academic results but also fosters creative thinking among students by giving them unique opportunities explore ideas independently under supervision within safe environment

"As a teacher, I believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. This is because knowledge is never static; it always grows and changes. When students are able to understand complex ideas and concepts, they are better able to problem solve and find solutions to problems. Furthermore, when students are able to understand complex ideas, they are more likely to be successful in their careers.

One example of how knowing and understanding complex ideas can help students succeed in their careers is the case of Elon Musk.

Elon Musk: The Innovator Behind Tesla Motors and SpaceX

As the founder of Tesla Motors and SpaceX, Elon Musk has shown us what is possible when a student understands complex ideas and concepts. In fact, both of his companies are highly innovative and have changed the way we view transportation and space exploration.

Tesla Motors was founded in 2003, and it is responsible for the manufacture of electric cars. Tesla has made a huge impact on the automotive industry, and it's electric cars are some of the most advanced on the market. Tesla’s biggest selling point is that it's cars are emission-free, which is a huge benefit for the environment.

SpaceX was founded in 2002, and it's primary mission is to enable humans to colonize Mars. SpaceX has made enormous progress in this area, and it has already sent two spacecraft to Mars. SpaceX plans to send thousands of people to Mars, and it is poised to make a huge impact on human space exploration.

Both Tesla Motors and SpaceX are highly successful companies, and their founders are experts in their fields. It is clear that knowing and understanding complex ideas can help students succeed in their careers.

There are many other examples of how knowing and understanding complex ideas can help students succeed in their careers. For example, John F. Kennedy was a politician who understood complex ideas and concepts. He was able to successfully lead the United States during some of the most difficult times in history.

Kennedy was a visionary leader who was able to see beyond the current situation and imagine what the future could be. His understanding of complex ideas helped him to make effective decisions during the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Vietnam War, and other important moments in American history.

Learning and understanding complex ideas is important for students, and it can help them to achieve success in their careers. I believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is to learn facts.

Making a positive first impression is immensely important when meeting someone for the first time. It can have a powerful effect on the success or failure of any relationship, be it with a colleague, friend, or romantic partner. A positive first impression can lead to trust, successful collaborations, and meaningful connections, while a negative first impression can quickly ruin an opportunity or sour a relationship.

Take job opportunities, for example. A potential employer base much of their decisions on an applicant’s first impression. Studies have shown that applicants who are well groomed, confident with their communication, and present themselves with respect and enthusiasm are much more likely to be hired. The same principle applies when looking for new friends or romantic partners. People tend to be attracted to confidence and enjoy talking to someone who communicates clearly.

When it comes to establishing good relationships with peers, a positive first impression goes a long way. People who are kind, calm, and welcoming are more likely to be liked and respected. It's almost a guarantee that an individual who exudes confidence and respect will make a better impression than someone who exudes anger and distrust.

In conclusion, it is incredibly important to strive for a positive first impression when meeting someone for the first time. Making a strong first impression can be the difference between getting an opportunity or losing out to a competitor, building strong relationships or souring them instantly, and being liked by peers or respected by them.",1

Subject: Supporting the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and to urge you to consider the importance of retaining this system for electing the President of the United States. While some argue for a change to the popular vote system, there are compelling reasons to maintain the current process.

One of the primary reasons for keeping the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it provides. As demonstrated in the 2012 election, the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. This results in a clear and decisive victory, reducing the likelihood of a dispute over the outcome. In our current divisive political climate, it is necessary to have a system that ensures a smooth transfer of power and avoids prolonged uncertainty.

Furthermore, the Electoral College promotes the concept of ""everyone's president."" This system requires presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal, as no region by itself has enough electoral votes to elect a president. By campaigning in different regions and appealing to a wide range of voters, candidates are encouraged to consider the interests of all Americans. This prevents any one region from feeling disenfranchised and promotes national unity.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is the significance it gives to swing states. In a winner-take-all system, candidates focus their campaign efforts on toss-up states, where the outcome is unpredictable. This ensures that voters in these states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, making them more thoughtful and informed voters. It is important that the election is decided by those who have carefully considered the candidates' policies and proposals.

Additionally, the Electoral College restores the weight of large states in the political balance, compensating for the mal-apportionment of the Senate as decreed by the Constitution. This avoids a situation where candidates primarily cater to the interests of smaller states, neglecting the needs of the majority. By providing large states with more attention during campaigns, the Electoral College ensures a fair representation of diverse interests across the nation.

Lastly, the Electoral College safeguards against the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College system invariably produces a clear winner. This prevents the complexity and cost that would be associated with run-off elections, allowing for a more efficient and decisive election process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a time-honored process that strikes a balance between the interests of smaller states and those of the nation as a whole. It strengthens our democracy by promoting national unity, ensuring the certainty of outcome, and recognizing the importance of swing states. I urge you to carefully consider these points and to continue supporting the Electoral College.

Thank you for your time and attention. I trust that you will make the best decision for the future of our nation. If you require any additional information or would like to discuss this matter further, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,

"The impact of technology on academic performance is a topic that has received increased attention in recent years. While technology can potentially be used as a powerful tool for learning, it must be used wisely and judiciously to maximize its effectiveness. This essay will explore the potential benefits and drawbacks associated with incorporating technology into student education, particularly at the college level. Technology has revolutionized educational practices in recent years, allowing students greater access to information than ever before. Online course materials such as lecture notes, online textbooks, and video lectures all provide students with more convenience when it comes to completing their assignments or studying for exams. Additionally, many schools now offer interactive tools like discussion boards or virtual classrooms where faculty members can engage with their students and answer any questions they may have about topics related to their courses. These resources not only make class time more productive but also enable knowledge acquisition outside of the traditional classroom setting by providing easy access to supplemental material anytime, anywhere. On the other hand, there are some drawbacks associated with relying too heavily on technology in academic settings; specifically that over-dependence on digital resources can limit critical thinking skills and discourage deeper understanding of core concepts covered in classes due to quick fixes such as googling answers or using autocomplete features during tests or essays instead of actively engaging with material presented in class sessions. Furthermore overuse of smartphones during lectures distracts both professors who have trouble getting points across while also hindering student concentration due to constant notifications which draw away focus from lessons being taught by instructors within physical classrooms. In conclusion although technological advances may be seen as beneficial when incorporated into higher education programs they should never replace face-to-face interactions between instructor and learner nor should they lead learners down paths towards mere surface level comprehension rather than deep intellectual engagement required for true mastery over subject matter being studied by university students today

"Title: Promoting Sustainability Through Reduced Car Usage

In the face of numerous environmental and public health challenges, limiting car usage has been proposed as a strategy to promote more sustainable and livable communities. Evidence from various sources across the globe supports the implementation of this model in both developed and developing nations, citing benefits such as reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved public health, and enhanced quality of life.

Residents of Vauban, a German suburb, have successfully adopted a car-free lifestyle, evidenced by 70 percent of families not owning cars (Rosenthal, 2009). The elimination of cars’ incessant noise has resulted in a serene environment where the chirping of birds and the chatter of children constitute the primary sounds (Rosenthal, 2009). Vauban’s model of “smart planning” not only discourages car usage but also encourages an active lifestyle through increased walking and cycling. Such planning initiatives can help other cities combat air pollution, a significant environmental issue that arrived in the spotlight when Paris had to enforce a driving ban due to hazardous smog levels (Duffer, 2014).

Car usage restriction, as seen in Vauban and on dysfunctional, smog-filled days in Paris, has also led to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, a known contributor to climate change (Rosenthal, 2009; Duffer, 2014). The decrease in car usage, and a shift to more energy-efficient transportation methods, reduce environmental impact and can significantly benefit public health.

Similar outcomes have been observed in the Colombian capital, Bogotá, where the annual “Day Without Cars” campaign encourages residents to use alternative forms of transport, significantly reducing traffic and resultant pollution (Selsky, 2002). The campaign has inspired an overall urban improvement effort, including expanding bicycle lanes and revitalizing public spaces, uplifting the urban quality of life and further promoting a culture of sustainability.

American behavior illustrates a changing trend regarding car usage, heralding beneficial implications for curbing greenhouse gas emissions (Rosenthal, 2013). In the long run, this could have positive effects on air quality, urban densification, and public health. Additionally, new and innovative commuting arrangements are emerging due to the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps, which provide easier access to shared rides and public transportation (Rosenthal, 2013). 

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are extensive and impactful. Reduced congestion, enhanced public health, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and a generally improved quality of life can be achieved by fostering a society that values sustainability and propels a shift away from auto-centric communities. The examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota demonstrate that a change is feasible and can lead to substantial benefits. Encouraging this transformative shift in urban planning and personal transportation is paramount for a sustainable, more livable future.",1
"The Impact of Single-Use Plastic on Marine Life. Single-use plastics have had a devastating impact on marine life and their habitats all over the world. This type of plastic, which is designed to be used once before being thrown away, has become ubiquitous in recent years due to its convenience and low cost. Unfortunately, this means that it is often not properly disposed of or recycled - instead ending up in oceans and other bodies of water where it can cause significant harm to wildlife. One major issue posed by single-use plastic is the sheer amount that ends up polluting waterways around the world. Studies suggest that as much as 8 million metric tons are dumped into our oceans annually - an alarming statistic considering how long most types take to decompose naturally. As the material breaks down over time into microplastics, they can sink lower into food chains where they are consumed by unsuspecting fish species and other sea creatures, leading to a range of digestive issues at best or death at worst. In addition, larger pieces can also cause physical injury if ingested or tangled around parts such as fins or flippers while others block sunlight from reaching vulnerable coral reefs below them; either way impacting overall population health in a given area. . . Beyond this direct harm however is something perhaps more sinister: The effect all this human waste has on entire ecosystems across vast regions of Earth’s waters. For example areas like Hawaii’s Great Pacific Garbage Patch contain large concentrations of plastics (and other debris) so dense that marine life finds themselves unable to swim through these regions due to entanglement with items such as six pack rings; preventing them from carrying out everyday tasks like foraging for food elsewhere – thus affecting whole populations within a short period!. Additionally when currents move trash from one area another problem arises: Pollutant matter enters new locations with unknown consequences on already fragile environments and communities therein who must now cope with yet another man made obstacle to their survival - creating

"Dear [State Senator],

I am writing to express my opinion on the topic of the Electoral College and whether we should keep it or change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. After carefully considering the arguments from multiple sources, I believe that we should keep the Electoral College for several reasons.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. As stated in the text by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate’s share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that the possibility of a dispute over the outcome is lower compared to a direct popular vote. In the 2012 election, President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral vote, even though he only had 51.3% of the popular vote. This shows that the Electoral College tends to create a clear winner.

Another important reason to keep the Electoral College is to ensure that the president is everyone's president. With its requirement for a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president on its own. This encourages candidates to campaign in different regions and consider the interests of all Americans. By having candidates with broader appeal, we can avoid the feeling of disenfranchisement that residents of certain regions may experience if they believe their votes do not count.

The Electoral College also brings attention to swing states. In the text by Judge Richard A. Posner, it is mentioned that the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes leads candidates to focus their campaign efforts on toss-up states. This means that voters in these states, who are most likely to decide the election, pay closer attention to the campaign. By engaging these voters, we can ensure that the most thoughtful and informed citizens have a say in choosing the president.

Additionally, the Electoral College helps balance the influence of big states. As Judge Richard A. Posner points out, the Electoral College restores some weight to large states that would otherwise be overshadowed by the mal-apportionment of the Senate. This ensures that presidential candidates pay attention to the concerns and interests of citizens in large states, as winning their votes can have a greater impact on the election outcome.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections. In instances where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, such as Richard Nixon in 1968 and Bill Clinton in 1992, the Electoral College has provided a clear winner. This eliminates the need for complicated additional elections and ensures a more efficient and decisive process.

While there are valid arguments against the Electoral College, such as those presented in the text by Bradford Plumer, the information provided in Judge Richard A. Posner's text provides practical reasons for retaining it. It fosters certainty in the outcome, ensures that the president represents all Americans, focuses attention on swing states, balances the influence of big states, and avoids the need for run-off elections.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that the Electoral College should be kept. It may have its flaws, but it provides a practical and effective method for electing the president of the United States. It promotes fairness, ensures the president represents all citizens, and balances the influence of different states. Thank you for considering my viewpoint on this important matter.

Sincerely,

Graduating early from high school can be a great opportunity for motivated and actively engaged students who are looking to take their education to the next level. While leaving the traditional high school structure may come with some drawbacks, there are also many potential benefits. Early graduates may be eligible for college credit, may be able to access more school choice options, and may be able to save on college tuition costs by finishing their schooling more quickly. Additionally, there may be additional adult opportunities available to early graduates that their peers who stay the traditional route may miss out on. 

However, early graduates face increased levels of responsibility for their own education that requires more planning and self-direction. Early graduates may miss out on traditional high school activities and may end up with an academic gap between applying for college and leaving high school, especially if college classes or advanced coursework have not been completed.

"It would be impossible to talk about the history of fashion without mentioning the iconic and revolutionary Balenciaga. The Spanish designer, born in 1895 as Cristobal Balenciaga, was known for his avant-garde designs that revolutionized the entire fashion industry. He began creating clothing from his home in San Sebastian before eventually opening a series of couture stores throughout Europe in 1937. His work has been described as luxurious yet modern and almost sculptural, with exaggerated silhouettes and attention to detail unlike any other designer at that time. Balenciaga was one of the first designers to create structured garments by inserting fabric or horsehair into seams and pockets for shape retention — something which is now commonplace among today’s designers. Many believe he pioneered what we know today as ‘modernist’ style – redefining luxury through his innovative use of fabrics, bold colours and unexpected forms. His most iconic silhouettes include balloon skirts, babydoll dresses, tunic coats all made using fabrics such as velvet crepe de chine silk georgette tweed wool gabardine cashmere etc. All combining details like pleats ruffles bows draping pockets snaps zips buttons… Each piece designed displayed an artistry beyond compare during its time period giving rise to many new trends within the industry including popularizing coloured tights long gloves hats scarves boots etc. . In addition to clothing design Balenciaga also moved forward with pioneering accessories including handbags sunglasses jewellery belts hats footwear even furniture! It can easily be said that this genius rewrote nearly every aspect of fashion designing pushing it far ahead into where we are today – technically superior timeless creations inspired by past generations but adapted for modern times setting a high bar for all future masters alike!

Today, we're going to talk about two very important operations - multiplying and dividing. We use multiplying and dividing to do calculations quickly and solve problems in the real world. 

Let's use an example to show how multiplying and dividing is faster than using adding and subtracting. Imagine that you have 10 apples and want to give them all to your friends. With adding and subtracting, you'd need to find the total of how many apples you have, and then take that total and divide it by 10 to figure out how much each friend will get. That's a lot of work!

But with multiplying and dividing, you can solve the problem much faster. You can just divide 10 by the number of friends you have -- let's say three friends here. That means you can say ""each friend will get three apples"" without doing any adding or subtracting!

So, as you can see, using multiplying and dividing can be a great way to solve problems quickly and efficiently -- so let's get to it and start learning!",1

"Limiting car usage has several advantages that can benefit both individuals and the environment. By reducing our dependency on cars, we can address issues such as greenhouse gas emissions, traffic congestion, and promote healthier and more sustainable lifestyles. This trend is already being seen in various parts of the world, including German suburb Vauban, Paris, and Bogota.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, contributing to climate change. In Europe, passenger cars alone account for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. In some car-intensive areas in the United States, this number increases to 50 percent. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change.

Another advantage is the reduction of traffic congestion. Suburbs that separate themselves from car use, like Vauban in Germany, have seen a decline in congestion. This not only improves the flow of traffic but also reduces the time people spend in their cars, improving productivity and quality of life. In Paris, a driving ban was enforced during periods of severe pollution, resulting in a 60 percent reduction in congestion. This demonstrates that limiting car usage can have a direct impact on reducing traffic and improving air quality.

Limiting car usage also promotes healthier and more sustainable lifestyles. In Vauban, 70 percent of families do not own cars, and 57 percent of residents sold their cars to move there. This shift has led to people adopting alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, cycling, and using public transportation. These activities not only contribute to increased physical activity but also reduce air pollution and reliance on fossil fuels.

Additionally, limiting car usage encourages the development of more compact and accessible communities. In Vauban, stores are placed within walking distance on a main street, rather than in distant malls. This concept is being adopted in other parts of the world as well, making suburbs more pedestrian-friendly and reducing the need for large parking spaces. By creating more walkable communities, we can promote social interaction, support local businesses, and reduce the need for excessive car usage.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has several advantages that can positively impact individuals and the environment. It reduces greenhouse gas emissions, alleviates traffic congestion, promotes healthier lifestyles, and fosters the development of sustainable communities. As seen in various examples around the world, including Vauban, Paris, and Bogota, the shift towards limiting car usage is gaining traction and proving to be beneficial for both present and future generations. It is important for citizens to recognize these advantages and support initiatives that promote alternative modes of transportation.",1

Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, “What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.” This quote offers insight into Emerson's view on exploring the world around us and using our skills to challenge ourselves. By engaging in activities that push us outside of our comfort zone, we are able to learn, experience, and gain knowledge that is valuable for our future.  

The benefits of taking risks and tackling new tasks far outweigh the comfort of staying idle in life. By embracing new experiences, we can hone in on our curiosity and gain confidence in our abilities. We can develop skills that can shape a brighter future for ourselves and the world around us. On the other hand, not challenging ourselves or attempting to master something can have serious consequences. Without a sense of leadership, creativity, and initiative, advancement can be difficult, if not impossible.
 
In order to successfully challenge ourselves and push the limits of our capabilities, we must understand the risks and rewards of taking on new tasks. By outlining our own goals and objectives, we can measure our own progress and determine if the challenge was worth our time. Ultimately, with determination and dedication, anyone can take on new tasks and experience a deeper understanding of their potential. ",1
"Studying Venus Remains Valuable Despite the Risks

The author makes a compelling case that exploring Venus remains worthwhile even given the planet's hazardous environment. While Venus presents clear dangers to potential explorers and equipment, the scientific rewards of studying our neighbor planet justify facing these risks. 

Several key pieces of evidence from the article support this. First, Venus remains one of the least understood planets in our solar system due to the difficulties of probing its surface. Developing technologies that can withstand its extreme conditions would allow scientists to finally learn fundamental details about Venus' formation and evolution. This could provide deeper insights into the processes that shaped our own world.  

Furthermore, Venus mimics some aspects of Earth's ancient climate, when our atmosphere was much thicker with greenhouse gases. Understanding Venus' current climate traps could offer lessons for mitigating or adapting to climate change on Earth. The article also notes that Venus' harsh climate may have buried treasures like volcanic ash deposits holding clues to the planet's ancient geology and water content. Robotic missions braving the intense heat, pressure and acidic clouds could unlock these scientific treasures.

While exploring Venus poses clear hazards, as the article acknowledges, the potential scientific payoffs warrant prudent and carefully designed missions to push the boundaries of what our technologies allow. Facing risks is part of the endeavor of exploration. By piecing together the puzzles of our closest planet, we expand our understanding of the Earth-Venus system and climate change on a broader scale. For these reasons, the author presents a compelling case that studying Venus remains a worthy goal despite the inherent perils it presents.",1
"There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the best course of action for successful people to take will vary depending on the individual. However, in general, I believe that successful people should try new things and take risks, rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.

One reason why successful people should try new things is that it allows them to grow and learn. Doing the same thing over and over again can lead to stagnation, as there is no opportunity to learn and improve. Trying new things, on the other hand, can introduce new challenges and help people learn new skills. This can be especially valuable for people who are looking to improve their career prospects or who want to move up the ladder in their field.

Another reason why successful people should try new things is that it can help them stay ahead of the competition. In today’s fast-paced world, it is more important than ever to be innovative and to constantly come up with new ideas. Trying new things allows people to do just that, and it can help them stay ahead of their rivals.

Finally, taking risks is an important part of being successful. It is often said that risk-taking is essential for achieving great things. While this is not always true, it is certainly true that successful people are not afraid to take risks. Trying new things often involves taking risks, and successful people are more likely to be successful if they are not afraid to take risks.

In conclusion, I believe that successful people should try new things and take risks, rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. There are many benefits to doing this, including learning new skills, staying ahead of the competition, and being more successful overall.

"There are a few things that students should be focused on in order to be successful in school. In addition, understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts. This is why it is important for students to understand what they are learning in order to be able to use it effectively in their classes and lives.

One way that students can understand concepts is by studying examples. For example, if I were to ask you to name the most common type of car, you would likely say a car. However, if I ask you to name the most common type of metal, you would likely say a metal. By studying examples, students can start to see the patterns that are being taught and can better understand the concepts.

Another way that students can understand concepts is by using examples from their own lives. For example, if I were to ask you to name the first thing that came to mind when I thought of school, you would likely say homework. However, if I were to ask you to name the first thing that came to mind when I thought of work, you would likely say work. By using examples from their own lives, students can start to see the patterns that are being taught and can better understand the concepts.

Lastly, students can also use online resources to help them understand concepts. For example, online quizzes can help students learn concepts while they are offline. Online resources can also be used to study for exams. By using online resources and studying examples, students can better understand the concepts and be able to use them effectively in their classes and lives.

Technology has revolutionized the way people interact and communicate with each other. On one hand, it has allowed people to connect with one another across greater distances and in new ways. With the invention of text messaging, video calls, and social networks, it is now easier than ever for people to remain in contact with those they love from wherever they may be. On the other hand, technology has also had a significant impact on the amount of physical contact that people have with each other. With so many different methods of communication available, many of which are digital, it can be easy to forgo face-to-face contact with family and friends. This lack of physical contact can have a detrimental effect on our emotional wellbeing and can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness. 

In conclusion, it is clear that technology has both positive and negative effects on human contact. It has enabled us to stay connected in new and exciting ways, while at the same time leading some of us to bypass the importance of physical contact. To make the most out of modern technology, it is essential that we place a premium on physical communication as well, so that our emotional connections with others can be strengthened.",1
"There is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on the individual and their specific circumstances. However, in general, young people are more likely to enjoy life than older people are.

There are a few key reasons for this. Firstly, young people are typically more carefree and optimistic than older people. They have not yet experienced the hardships and heartbreaks that often come with age, and so they are still more likely to see the world in a positive light. Secondly, young people are typically more active and engaged in the world around them than older people are. They are more likely to be involved in social activities, travel, and pursue new hobbies and interests. Finally, young people are still in the process of discovering who they are and what they want out of life. This can be an exciting time, and it often leads to a more fulfilling and enjoyable life.

There are, of course, exceptions to this general rule. Some older people are very active and engaged in their communities, and they enjoy life just as much as young people do. And some young people are carefree and optimistic to a fault, and they may not have as much fun as they could be having. But, on the whole, young people are more likely to enjoy life than older people are.

"The debate about whether children should learn to compete or cooperate has been ongoing for years. While some people believe that competition is necessary for success, others argue that cooperation is more important. In my opinion, I believe that children should be taught to cooperate rather than compete.

Firstly, cooperation promotes a sense of teamwork and collaboration. In today's world, most jobs require individuals to work in teams and collaborate with others. By teaching children to cooperate, they learn how to work with others towards a common goal. This skill will help them in their future careers and personal relationships.

Secondly, competition can lead to negative effects on children's mental health. When children are constantly competing, they may feel the pressure to always be the best. This can lead to anxiety, stress, and even depression. In contrast, cooperation fosters a healthy environment where children can learn from one another without fear of judgment or failure.

Finally, cooperation encourages empathy and understanding. When children work together, they learn to appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses. This helps them to become more compassionate and empathetic towards others. In a highly competitive environment, children may become more self-centered, only focused on their own success.

To illustrate, let's take the example of a classroom. A teacher who encourages cooperation and teamwork may assign group projects or activities that require children to work together. Through this, they learn to communicate effectively, respect each other's opinions, and work towards a common goal. On the other hand, a teacher who emphasizes competition may have a grading system that pits students against each other. This can create an unhealthy environment where children feel pressure to outperform their classmates, leading to a highly stressful and unpleasant experience.

In conclusion, while competition may have it's benefits, I believe that cooperation is more important for children's overall development. By fostering a sense of teamwork and collaboration, promoting mental health, and encouraging empathy, children will be better equipped to navigate the challenges of the future.

"Making the right choice is easier said than done, but what an unfortunate amount of people don't realize, is that all the help they need to make a better choice, is a simple solution. They just need to talk. Although a simple solution, a sizable amount of people don't even bother to ask others for advice, even when there's enough benefits to fill up an entire essay. Seeking multiple opinions or advice can help someone make a better choice because he or she will acquire advice from different people, learn advice that was earned by experience, and will be able to use advice and opinions from the past.

Conversely, opinions from different people may help an individual make a better choice, for a number of reasons. Firstly, advice from multiple people gives you different perspectives on a matter. Using differing points of view lets you think about a problem in a different way, letting you take a different approach. Varying perspectives may even help you come to a better choice quicker. Not only that, the right choice to a problem almost always requires a diversity in perspectives, but the usefulness of others' advice doesn't stop there. Advice from multiple people also means different opinions. Even if no opinions are satisfactory, advice can be tweaked to one's liking, a combination of some, or compared.

Then, there's the opinions that don't need change. The ones that have been earned from others' experience. These essential opinions help make better choices because they're based on experiences that have actually happened. For obvious reasons, these opinions are reliable, not to mention the person sharing said advice believes that it would help your situation as well. That's not all. Opinions from experience narrows down the choices to make. This can really help making a better choice that much easier. Not only does it show a perfect solution, it helps to make the decision faster, without stressing too much over it.

Finally, a solution that doesn't require asking anyone for help, is remembering advice gained before. This solution also helps to cut down on time to make a better decision, and could amass more advice than if one had asked for opinions from others. This solution doesn't restrict itself to just oneself. Individuals may also look into their friends and family's past. Because friends and family are the closest to a person, one may easily be able to recall events and advice given to close ones.

These are some easy solutions one shouldn't try to miss when faced with a decision. You could learn different points of view, real advice that could be applied to yourself, or learn to remember the past, but in the end, they're all telling the same thing. Something that ""...an unfortunate amount of people don't realize."" Just talk. It's easier than you might think.",0
"During my life i have watched many presidential elections on my television. To me the Electoral College on paper should work, Should being the key word. As I read the paragraphs on both why the Electoral College work and does not work I have decides the side with not having the Electoral College.

Historical evidence and evidence from this paragraph piont to not having a Electoral College. One reason for this was when Al Gore lost the presidency but won the popular vote nation wide as stated in Source 2. another piont is that if the people have so munch power over who is voted to be president then how do we have a president that the people did not want the president but the person is still elected, its an outrage! One example of how the Electoral College could be a disaster waiting to happen is that the votes are tied which may seem not likey at first glance but say if the votes are tied the presidency is thrown into the House of Representatives which lets face it, in the end the decision will not be approved by the people and the people will then barely have a say on who gets to be president or not. Another thing is the Electoral College can also be vary bisest towrdes one party or the other. This is evident because if a certain party got more electors than another party which whould led to a canedat from one party have more support then another.

Source 3 talks about how sure thats its possible for their to be a tie in the Electoral College but its unlikely supports what im trying the say in my earlier Paragraph, that even though a tie is unlikely it is still possible to happen the chance is still their. This paragraph also says the everyone is a president but if that is the case then why dose the poeple that ""we"" vote for the electoral College help vote for the president insted vote for the other canadate is an atrosidy on its own. The winnertakeall system is one that only afects the swing states because if thoughs states have already voted then the staes the already votes whould be for not because the numbers for who gets voted whould be already in favor of one state or another. The fact the larger states have a bigger say in who gets voted on is not fair. the is becuase if all the big states vote for someone and about 14 of the smaller states vote on one end of the scale and the other states vote towrdes the other end of the scale then the ballence whould be off and one side would overpower the other side by fact of shear numbers of votes compared to the other side.

After reading over my responce and the evidence that I have profided form the paragraph hear I have with great pride that i have argued my point across to you that the Electoral College in paper is good but in reality is only a crumbleing castle waiting to fall into the tiny bites and pieces that it should be.",0
"In 1976 pictures where taken of Mars with the Viking 1 spacecraft from NASA. We have dicovered that the pictures look like a face on Mars. We can garentee that ""aliens"" did not do this. From the data we collected it seems to be that Mars was having formations and the ground/rocks looked like it had shadowed a face.

Over the years as you can tell in the pictures the face begins to form into something different. The ""Face"" is starting to not look like a face anymore. If there were life on Mars they would try to keep the form from changing, right?

Yes we know what you are thinking, ""That cant be Mars doing that,"" but we have not collected any data of any sign of life on Mars. We have no reason to believe that Mars has any life form of any kind on it. We have seen from other data though that Mars has been changing and the landforms have changed. This is just another formation.

Futhermore we have concluded that the ""Face"" on Mars is just rock formation. There is no futher information on the ""alien"" therory and that this is out of the picture.. As you can tell in the picture there is other rocks surrounding it and it is just like the other rocks, they have shadows and the ""Face's"" shadow is just more life like. The formations of every planet have changed and will continue to change so anything can happen next.",0
"It is wise that election is chosen by popular vote. I think that it should be kept this way, and all that are Electoral College should be changed to election by popular vote. Election by popular vote is an easier choice and makes things more simple. It could give candidates more of a chance to get elected. Time would be wisely saved if all states had the same system, it would give people more of a chance to get elected.

In the Electoral College voters vote for a portion of electors, not the president. The Electoral College is unfair to voters, this process is just undated and not right. A lot of states may not even see their candidates. If election by popular vote is used more than the places that don't, then they should be changed.

It is just easier to decide when there are more or less voters. The Electoral College just has less of a chance to be kept. If every state did the same to elect then it would be easier to decide who should be the president of the United States.",0
"In my personal oppinion I think it's best to keep the Electoral College. Don't get me wrong I think people should have a say in it too, but in all seriousness we the people we really can't make good decisions. For instance what they say may blind us from the hard on facts and we'll make a horrible decision just because they can manipulate us with words. The Electoral College can pick the person that is perfect for the job but we can't.

""A candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president."" (Richard A. Posner) It states there that if the person is popular in some sates and everybody likes him, that doesn't mean he would be fit to be president. The Electoral College doesn't pick them because of what they say and if they persuide you to like them, they look at the facts and see if that person is fit to be the president. Maybe it's best if they were to decide on the president but I'm also saying that we should have some say in it.

We're the ones living here we all have a right too. It doesn't matter if we make poor decisions we're only human that's what we do, that doesn't mean we shouldn't have a say in it. ""The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" (Bradford Plumer) Sure the Electoral College doesn't normally decide on what we have to say but they should take it in consideration.

I think that we should keep the Electoral College and let the proffessionals do what they do best. As the people living with what the president has to say I still think it's highly important that we have some say on who the president is. Will we make the right decisions? probably not but we're only human can you blame us? No I didn't think so.",0
"Cars come in different colors, and are what we use to transport anything. Whether it a family going on vacation, going to  work or going to school.  With all of these possible benfits and more is what we gain from cars. We don't realize how cars really have an effect in our everyday changing world. That the moment we put the car key in to turn on the car we are creating are more hazordous world for the present time and  the furture to come. By,limiting car usage in the world we can do many postive and beneficial things like in our atmosphere,  becoming a independent person without the need of a car, and to be relive as oneself.

To begin with, pollution can be reduced like never ever before in are world named history. Pollution now in days is just terrible to have. It not just make it difficult  for us to breathe but, as well it destroy the atmoshere that we need protect us from the harmful rays of the sun. The greenhouse effect can be lowered if we limit the use of cars. This can be actually proven with the following exert of the passage,"" And that experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" (Source #1) The point that I'm really trying to convey, is that we can do this all together if we limit the car usage. There should be a well and profounded effort to do so. Another example would be that if we dont limit the usage of cars we can not have a fresh and clear atmoshere. Can you imagine a day that you wake up to find, that all that was around you be nothing but a smog and prevent you to see and do anything? The car we have produce dangerous toxic that can up in are air and can be very hard for us later on. But if limit car usage, we can prevent this from happening. Not, just us but to other place in the world. This was what happen in France ,to prevent the usage for cars producin that smog they created an renforce day to prevent the use of car. Which lead to a shocking over turn of news. Like so in the following,""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France"" (Source #2) What I'm trying to inform once again is that we limit we can create a better fit living world to be in. This is one advantages that we can do as fellow citizens in our country

Which lead to me to my othe point, there is more that we have in advantage of limiting the usage of cars. It is a way of ""smart planing"" ourself as a community. We can live a more free caring world without the need of a car. Technology can play a part in the limit of of car usage. As stated in the folllowing ""The Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends."" (Source #4)See this occur and happen this a will fitted advantage to us all. Another, advantage that we have in hand is the ability to relieve our stress level to a much stable level. which lead to me to my other insight of information, ""When I had a car I was alwaystense. I'm much happier this way"" said Heidrun Walter"" (Source #1) Being in the car makes it complicated and diifficult. This is another way for us take advantage to limit the use of cars.

In conclusion, there are many advantegous for that we can benifit from that if we limit the use of care by lower pollution in are atmospher, creating a more benficial way for ouself without the need of a car, the relive of oneself. So, the next time you get on your car think is it reall a need to do so?",0
"Are you for or against the value of using this technology to read students emotional expression? No, I do not believe we as a whole should be able to use this. The reason why I believe this should not happen is because everyone is intitled to their own opinion. The fact that a computer is able to distinguish this type of information is very scary.

In the article the author Nick D' Alto talks about Mona Lisa he says ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"" (Alto 1). This quote itslef is nerve racking due to the fact that a computer is able to find this information out. Using this type of technology to read students emotional expressions would be helpful but it would not be professional. Honestly who would want to see what a teenager feeling?

There are many other ways this technology can be used such as prison. so we are able to track prisoners feelings. Overall using this type of technology on a group of inncocent people is unprofessional. This type of technology should be controlled in a proper manner.",0

"Will vehicles be gone in the near future? Many movements have started due to cars polluting the air and melting the polar ice caps. For one, a community has been built where cars are not allowed, and a car-free movement started in Bogata, Columbia three years ago that banned vehicles other than buses and taxes. Also, due to deisel cars polluting the air that made Paris be on par with China's pollution, they ended up banning cars for some time.

""Since World War II, all of our development has been centered on the car,"" said David Goldberg, an official of transportation for America. The Environmental Protection Agency of the United States is promoting ""car reduced"" communities. Many hope that public transport serving suburbs play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year. 80 percent of appropriations have by law only gone to highways and 20 percent to other transport. Vauban, which was completed in 2006, is one example that seperates suburban life from auto use. As a result of 40,000 dollars being needed to buy a space for a car along with a home, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars. Vauban, with a population of over 5,000 residents, might be the most advanced low-car suburban life experiment.

Bogota, Columbia has started with a car-free day which is spinning into a big hit. Millions of Columbians either hiked, biked, skated or took buses to get to their destinations during the car-free day. For three straight years, in the capital city of Bogata, 7 million people were able to get to their destinations without the use of cars. As said by one of the residents of Bogota, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and air pollution"". 118 miles of bicycle paths have been made due to the improvement campaign that was created in the mid-1990s. Many parks and sportss centers have also bloomed throughout the city due to the campaign and ban on vehicles.

Due to all the congestion and pollution, Paris ended up issuing a partial driving ban to clear the air of pollution. In the following days, motorists with either even or odd numbered plates were either forced to leave their cars at home or pay a fine of 31 dollars. Due to the fact that France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline, they were blamed for the pollution in the air. 67 percent of vehicles in france are diesel vehicles. After 5 days congestion was down about 60 percent which rivaled the pollution was in Beijing, China which is know as one of the most hugely polluted cities in the world. Due to Paris putting a temporary ban on cars, they had complains about companies losing revenue. When the pollution in the air started to clear up enough, the ban on cars was lifted.

In conclusion, cars might end up being banned in multiple places around the globe to help with pollution. According to experts, it is said that there has recently been a large drop in the usage of cars and it will continue to drop. Demographic shifts suggests that there has been a large decline in the percentage of 16 to 39 year olds getting licenses to drive vehicles. A study last year has also showed that driving by young people has declined 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. Many studys have showed that the decline in people getting licenses and driving will continue to reduce rapidly.",0
"Many people agree in abolishing the Electoral College. Electoral Collage caused a dispute in the year 2000. The Electoral College is a irrational system and it should be banned.

Certainly the Electoral College has some benefits. In the passage ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our sidpised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner the author states that the Electoral College ""avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of votes cast."" With the Electoral College there is no issue of a candidate getting the most votes, so there wont have to be any runoff elections. Runoff elections complicated the election process. Posner asserts that the ""winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote."" It is because of this that the possibility of an argument over the outcome of an Electoral College is lesser then an argument over the popular vote. Although this is true, the people should have the say on who their president will be. The Electoral College is a broken voting system that causes confusion and dispute. Therefore, the Electoral College should not be used as a way of voting for America's President.

A key issue is that the candidate with the most popular vote does not have the certainty of winning. This is a problem because America can not have the leader she wants and deserves. Bradford Plumer from the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" argues that the Electoral College causes "" the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency."" If the people can not chose who they want as their leader then where is their freedom? Plumer also states that the voters can not always ""control whom their electors vote for,"" We dont get to chose who the electors are voting for. This way the value of the people's opinion is being diminished into nothing. The reasonable solution to this problem is to just end the Electoral College imidiatly.

Another factor is that the electors have to much power over the election. Palmer writes ""that the electors could always defy the will of the people,"" The electors are the only people who have decent amount of power to chose a president. The people should have that kind of power. The author asserts that the electors "" have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please,"" The electors are able to just change their mind when wver they like. The popular vote must decide on who should win. The future of america should depend only on the will of the people. The people has to finally stand up and fight for their right to chose their own President.

In final consideration, the Electoral College is unfair to the American people. We should have freedom to chose whom our country's leader should be. The popular vote should stay and the Electoral College should be banned once and for all.",0
"Venus has been a planet neighboring the Earth and the Sun for many years. There has been many discoveries about the planet Venus and about other planets too. More discoveries can be made in order to figure out how we can live on other planets and also other discoveries for Venus can be made.

Venus is called the Evening Star due to the fact that it is very bright when seen. Venus is the second planet in our solar system and it is almost as bright like the sun, when a stargazer looks up to the sky they can see our planet venus because it is easy to spot for a couple reasons. One beinging it is bright and the second it is close to our moon. The Moon and Venus can be considered twins, they are close in size, and it is close to our Earth but it is also close to the Moon. Venus is a warm planet not nearly as hot as the Sun but somewhere around there, so if huamns were sent up to space to live on Venus they wouldn't survive. There is no water in Venus it is just hot and lots of lava.

Over the years NASA has tried to send spacecraft up to Venus. They haven't been succesful due to the fact that it's so hot on Venus, every spacecraft ever sent has only lasted a couple hours. Not a single human has even been on Venus, they wouldn't want to risk someones life if a spacecraft cant survive than a human wouldn't be able to survive. Venus is truly a difficult planet for humans to study, not a single space ship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Planet venus has 97 percent carbon dioxide, the temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit that is extremely hot, that is 90 times greater than what we experince on Earth. We would think that Mercury would be a hotter planet due to the fact that it is closer to the Sun but it turns out it's not.

Even though Venus is a hard planet to study scientist haven't given up yet. They are willing to do everything that is possible in order to find out more about it, scientist still want to visit the planet. Scientists say that Venus at one point was the most Earth-like planet in our solar system, it probably had Oceans on it, Valleys and even mountains. Scientists are still developing new technology to send humans up into Venus so they can study it and find out more about the planet. They have even thought about designing something that allows astronauts to float on Venus so they dont have to be on Venus, that way they wont get burned.

In Conclusion, more discoveries can be made in order to figure out how we can live on other planets and many more discoveries for Venus can be made. Many things are still being tested in order for us to find out more about our planet. Scientist aren't going to give up until they get some clear shots, there may be some difficulties during the process but it will totally be worth it. Nasa is working on other approaches to study Venus, some simplified eletronics have been made to make it easier to study Venus. These eletronics will be easy to use so scientist can make further discoveries but also study the planet without getting hurt.",0
"Today I will be talking about being on your phone while driving and why you shouldn't do it. We will be speaking about what can happen if you be on your phone while driving and what the punishment may be. And we will speak about the reason we shouldn't do it and what may happen if we do.

You shouldn't be on your phone in the car because you can get distracted from the road and in up doing something or crashing. Also if you have someone else in the car with you, you will end up putting their life at risk there life shouldn't be in the hands of someone who focus on their phone more than driving. Texting & driving is more debilitating to your reaction time than driving while under the influence of alcohol. That shows that what you are doing on your phone you will be more on that then driving and have more of a chance of crashing or getting in a wreck.

Now we will be talking about the punishment for being on your phone while driving. Monetary fines these can range from as low as $20 up to $500 depending on the state. Is it really worth almost $500 just so you can send that message. Next is in some states texting while driving can result in criminal misdemeanor charges. Finally, if the offense has resulted in bodily injury to another driver, jail or prison time may be imposed. You can end up going to jail and or prison just for being on your phone these thing are given to you because of the dangers of being on your phone while driving. People who chose to be on their phone while driving are choosing to put other people in danger because you want to see who texted you.

For, Conclusion being on your phone while driving is very bad it can end up to you getting in an accident even end up hurting other people on the road. The outcome of you being on your phone while driving you can have to pay a fine for over $500 and next even jail time. There is no good reason for you to be on your phone while driving whenever you really need to check your phone pull over and do so but doing on while driving is never a good thing. To end this all off being on your pone while driving never do just don't it just ends in pain and regret.",0
"Have you ever needed advice for a choice before? If you have and you have trouble making them on your own, that can affect your actions. If you don't know what to do go get some opinions from others. Getting multiple perspectives from others helps you because you will get more opinions on what to do and what not to do.

First, knowing that you have more then one person to talk to and get their opinion, can make you more likely to go ask more people for them. If people have had similar problems to you, where other people have those problems. Get both opinions on this problem, the more opinions you get the more options you have on your choice. It can also turn into you helping someone if you go to them and you guys work together to fix this problem on both ends.

Next, talking to multiple people could lead to different emotions on this topic and help you understand how you could feel. You could have a strong feeling about your opinion but you always need to think about what you're going to say. The more you talk about this to others, the more you will hear yourself and your perspective might change. If your perspective changes this could cause you to do something different that can lead to you having a better choice and decision.

Lastly, if you get only one opinion that could have a negative impact on you, leading to you making the wrong choice which can't be undone. In past experience I have had to make some choices, many of them i'm not to proud with. Most of the time I went to get one persons opinion because I didn't have much faith or trust in others. That ended up badly because they gave me their opinion and I didnt have any other opinions to base her's off of, so the choice I made ended up being a mistake.

In conclusion, having many peoples opinions to make a better choice and not mess up is better than just getting one opinion. You need to think hard about whose/what opinion you're gonna take. As stated in the essay, one opinion could have a bad influence, your emotions about it can vary and having people to talk to will make you go talk to more people. How will having multiple opinions help you with your choices?",0
"In this world many people or students were being suicide and some people they just don't have hope. Many people are facing many different kind of difficulties and sadness. For instance some people might be upset because they don't have families and can be because they are not as smart as other people in school. Some people are facing difficulties while other are living happily. But we people don't know how other people feel and we don't understand each other how we feel inside of our heart.

First,using this technology to read students' emotional expressions is valuable. The reason why i think it is good is because sometimes some students are not as smart as other students and some students are afraid to ask question that they don't understand and afraid to discuss with their teacher. But if we use this technology to read students' emotional expression in class, it would be really useful thing and meaningful for students. it would make students even better and smarter. As we can see in the articles it says""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" If all teachers use the computer that knows students' feelings that would also help/make student to improve and develope their knowledge. Second,some students keep skipping class it can be because since they don't understand the lessons that they learn, they feel bored and stress and they behave bad in class so it makes them want to skip class so that they can stay away from stressness. But if teachers use technology that can read studens' emotional expression so that teacher would know which student doesn't understand and confused the lessons and teacher can explain those who didn't understand after school or during their lessons. Finally if they keep using this technology,one teacher can change a thousand studens' bad behavor and mind.

In conclusion,making useful things for those who feel hopeless and helpless are one of precious thing in our lives. Even though we all are came from different countries we have similarities things in some ways like how we face difficulties and that thing makes us one.",0
"All we talk about is being able to be our own person and to be able to do things on our own but having electoral college isn't gonna help with that. Electoral college is when you select a group of electors to chose who they want to be president and you choose the group of electors which you want. Every group of electors will have their own opinion on who they want to be president so you have to be very cautious on who you pick. Popular vote is a more independent way of letting us citizens know that we can be able to vote without the help of our electors. Senator, it would be outrageous for us to be so dependent on the electors when its unnecessary and we can vote on our own.

There have been times when people choose the wrong electors and they can't go back to change it, so why not just vote on your own and have the ability for clarrification and honesty on who I vote for. I feel like having an electoral college is a waste of time and it's only making things more complicated. If you should have a system it should be one that makes peoples lives easier not even more stessful. Also the voters can't control who the electors vote for so you make be telling the electors one thing but they will be doing another. These are the things that us citizens need to thing about. Should we have to doubt our electors? no, we should trust that they will vote for the president that we asked them too.

Voting for president is very serious because, that president will be representing where we live and what we stand for so it can't be something that we slack off on, it needs to be something that we are proud of and the only way thats going to happen is if we choose our own president without our electors to do that for us. Us citizens should be proud and honored that we have the opportunity to choose our president because not most people have that chance and electoral college will be taking that for granted. Popular vote assures that our vote counts and it gives us the independent character that we need to be strong.

Senator, I think that if you want everyone to fell secure and trusted then you should keep using popular vote.",0
"The ""Face"" on mars(the red planet) been there since 1976 which is when it was discovered and was not fully formated yet and still is not formed. So,it shows that it was not created millions of year's ago by some extra-terrestrial bieng(s).Also,when the Viking 1 Mars Global Surveyor(MGS) took the photo in 1976 it looked as if it was just a common landform created by some-type of desert storm,and now that other photos have came in from May 24,2001 from Viking 2 we are shown that it is not a face but a few mesa's(mesa-landforms common around the American west) with shadows on it showing features of a human bieng but are really just hills of sand with weirdly shaped landforms and shadows. Also,on many planets we have seen craters,mountain,and canyons that look like something they're not,and when the shadows are not there you can tell that they are just naturally formed sand hills. Finally,In 1998 the Mars Orbiter Camera(MOC) took 10 photos much sharper photos(5 times sharper)than the original Viking 1 did in 1976 and the photos on the (MOC) showed and revealed to be that there was no alien monument or alien worshipping monument just natural landforms.",0
"Would you like if your emotions are being detected withouht your consetiment? Technology is every day beging more capable of new things, in terms of artificial intelligenece. The new software has been developled so that it can read or decode the emotions of others. Dr. Eckman has classified six bassic emotions - happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness-, he assocciated each emotion with movements on the facial muscles.

It is important to know how the muscles in our body , in our face works , and what an amazing way to know through technology. But at the point to that technology knows what are your emotions to then use them on ""what you need"" is not correct. I am not saying that when we want to search about emotions through technology there should not be anything on it. But what if we are trying to hide emotions for our or others good and technology just cames and reads or decodes your emotions how would you feel?

It is also important to know the basic of emotions, because that how you express yourself.",0
"In my ophion, technology reading students emotional expressions is the dumbest thing ever and here is why.

First, the apps they are using just changes the student indivaully like you can not make someone be happy on a computer you can make them look happy they should not change someone for who they want them to be vs what they are. Second, you should not change a photo or use any edits because thats changing you and you should just be you if you dont smile thats okay dont let people judge you on how you look you should impress your self not somebody eles. Third, People today need to realize that changing someone in any type of way could hurt them even worse. Yes, messing with peoples emotion or sometimes trying to figure it out whats wrong with them can set off alot of things. Instead of making someone look happy people should talk to the person that is upset, trying to be there for them maybe thats all they need or tell them soemthing postive to brighten there day.

In Conclusion, I think changing someones pictures to make them look like they are happy is the wose idea ever because deep down they know they are, but do you just because someone makes and upset face dosnt always mean they are.",0
"I thinks the new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enbles computers to indenify humans emotions is good things like what the author says on paragraph 3 because that can helps the people if the computers can indentify people emotions like if they happy or sad and if it can makes people feels better if the computers help the people like taking them to a websites where they can read a story or others like playing games, listen to music and watching news that make them relaxing.

Also I thinks what the sciencetists says on paragraph 1 ""Developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate"", this means that they said like it better for all people if they developing a software that can recognize emotions.

Another good things about the emotion recongnition like what it says on paragraph 4 because the software can also recognize faces on a pictures.

If the new computer software that can tells people emotions, sciencetists should make them more valuable like adding more news features to it and that will make more people to like them.",0
"Dear Senator, Electoral college may be a despised method to some people but it has been the system established by our founding fathers and remains until this day. It may not be perfect but every method has its flaws, including popular vote, respectively. The popular voting system is not the best method since it can end up not defining certainty of the outcome. Electoral college has prevailed until this day and it should remain this way for the United States of America.

Although electoral college may be called outdated, irrational and unfair Brandon Plumer 14. This isnt true because if it were so outdated and unfair it would have been substituted or changed by another system but it has remained because of its efficiency. This system is certainly not unfair because as stated in a article by Richard A. Posner,he explains ""each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed."" As for the irrational portion of the opposing view, as stated in "" in defense of the electoral college..."" article has multiple reasons but one of them is ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal."" No region South,Northeast,etc. has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" The single best argument against Electoral College may be called ""the disaster factor"" as claimed by Brandom Plumer in his article opposing the Electoral College. Certainty of Outcome is a strong point for Richard a. Posner in his article defending the electoral college and carefully states ""A dispute over the outcome of the Electoral College vote is possibleit happened in 2000but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote."" He Richard Posner also reminds the reader that the Electoral College avoids issues in elections in which no candidate receives majority of the votes cast and there is no pressure for a ""runoff election"" when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast.

Another factor brought to our attention by ""the indefensible electoral college..."" article is that since the Electoral College uses the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates dont lose time in states they are most likely to not win in and they focus mostly on ""swing"" states. Although the ""swing"" states system is used, it is simply utilized becauseit induces the candidates as seen in 2012's election. But the voters in tossup states are most likely to pay more attention to the campaign, and it is decreed that the most thoughtful voters should be the chosen ones to decide the election.

Ultimately with all the information cited it is quite obvious which option is best for the U.S. Electoral College may have it's cons but the pros outweigh it. This is not a new method. It was defined by the Founding Fathers that wrote our constitution that has held our country in unisom until this day. Now in 2015 it is still the leading force in the government and should be kept that way. the Electoral college is the best suited for America and should'nt be altered.",0
"Hey you! Do you need some advice about something and you just don't know what will give you the best answer? Well you are in luck because this may help you! Talking to more than one person for advice is the best solution. Seeking multiple answers can help someone make a better choice because it can prevent bias, you will have more answers, and you will feel great at the end. Listening to more than one opinion is more reliable than just listening to one. Whenever I ask for some advice I always talk to more than one person because at the end I will feel good about myself. Everyone have their own opinion about something. If you ask more than one person then you will realize their answers will be different.

Seeking multiple opinions can prevent bias. If you ever watched the news then you know some news sites contains a lot of bias. That is why you hear some people say to read more than one article. Just like reading more than one article, it is more reliable to listen to multiple opinions instead of one. Everyday I look at the media and I see plenty amounts of events happening. Whenever I click on one I will have to look at other articles because I keep thinking there is bias in them. Which is why in the world there are a lot of disagreements which leads to bias in the news, media and even in people that you trust. It is right for someone to have their own opinion, but it is also right for someone to be cautious about their opinion. By hearing more than one opinion, you will get the best advice from multiple people.

You will be provided with more than one answer. Everyone have their own opinion about something. For example, if you asked someone for advice about what to do before a test then one may say ""Just eat a mint"" or ""Eat a healthy breakfast"". With the example here I have a lot of options to choose from. If you ever asked your classmate a question and they answered it, but they said they don't know if it's correct then you should have asked your teacher or other classmates. This will not only allow you to get your correct answer but it also allows you to get more than one answer. Having more than one answer is always a good thing because you can look at them and find the differences and similarities. You can also use the extra advice too.

You will feel comfortable after talking to more than one person. Looking back at the last paragraph, I said you will be provided with a lot of answers if you talk to more than one person. It will also make you feel comfortable too! One time I needed some advice for middle school so I asked my parents, teachers, and my older brother. They all responded differently, but I also got a lot of advice too. I felt comfortable because I have a good amount of advice. You will feel better after talking to more than one person because you are sure that the answer they gave you is correct and reliable.

Seeking multiple answers can help someone make a better choice because it can prevent bias, you will have more answers, and you will feel great at the end. After reading this you may still think ""Why is this important?"". It is important because someday everyone will need to use this technique to make sure they are getting the best advice possible. The next time you need advice or your friend need advice then please use this technique to help you and your friend to get the reliable answers.",0
"Would you like to explore another planet? If so, which one? The author of this artical talks about exploring Venus. He explains what its like there and gives us facts like how it can be the closest planet to Earth time to time but it's really hot there and hard to explore. His reasons for exploring Venus is the closest planet to earth and is earth like and its a challenge that we should take no matter the risk. I dont think that he explained good enough on why its worth it.

The author of the artical, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" tells us that ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."" This means that because its close and Earths ""twin"" its its worh exploring no matter the challenge it brings.

The author also says ""Our travels on Earth should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" When he says this he thinks that we should explore Venus no matter the dangers but in the artical he listed the dangers. He says Venus has a ""thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater that what we experience on our own planet."" If it's 90 times grater than what we experience on earth is it worth studying? He tells us that they sent nemerous spaccrafts to Venus but nun of them survieved longer than a few ours. If your spaceships cant land there and survive why send a human there risking lives?

In conclusion he told us some good facts about Venus like how its called Eaths twin, can be closest to earth sometimes, almost same size and same density,and that its 800 degrees Fahrenheit but i dont think his reasons explained good enough on why we should risk exploring there but he did have some good ideals on what they can do to explore Venus like hover over it 30 plus miles studying it.",0
"The Electoral College basically serves as a filter for the votes of every individual American citizen. Every single vote that comes from citizens is a vote for somebody else who will be voting for the president, not the candidates themselves. The Electoral College is flawed to the point where the most logical way to vote would be to base presidential elections off of popular votes.

The Electoral College encourages the presidents who are running for office to avoid campaigning towards states with a smaller amount of electoral voters. If the president is determined by the most electoral votes, it would make sense that the president would campaign towards larger states with more electoral voters such as California, Texas, and Florida. Why would they spend time trying to appeal to some of the smaller states? This can lead to some states not even seeing the candidate. Infact, during the 2000 election, voters in the 25 largest media markets did not witness any campaign advertising.

The Electoral College's process of voting suppresses the voice of every citizen. The balance between smaller and larger states comes into play here as well. Take Florida for example, a state with 29 total electoral votes. If the mass majority of Florida votes for a certain set of electors, the minority votes for the other ones would not matter at all, as the electors speaking for that certain fraction of the population would not elected. With popular voting, each and every vote would matter towards electing a president. The number of minority votes would directly apply to the outcome of the president.

The Electoral College and the electors should not be the voice of the country. The voice of the people should be heard, especially when it comes to presidential elections. Popular voting is the most fair and rational method of voting. The Electoral College is best off forgotten as a voting system.",0
"The Face on Mars is a natural landform it has been a pop icon since it started in HollyWood Films, Books, Magazines, Talk shows, and haunted check-out lines for more than 20 years!. How could The Face on Mars be created by aliens if aliens aren't real? Why would NASA go through all that trouble to make a fake Face on Mars.

The face is a natural landform because, before it was a face NASA captioned it as a ""Huge rock formation"". It was a humans head it was also formed by shadows, which made it seem like the huge rock formation had eyes, nose, and a mouth. But it was just an illusion. NASA knew that if they were to put the ""huge rock formation"" on Mars they would attract a lot of attention. The were right! As soon as the huge rock formation was on Mars that's when NASA started getting all the attention NASA knew was coming.

So this is why I state that NASA's ""huge rock formation"" is NOT fake, like I said earlier why would NASA go through so much trouble just to make a fake humans head on Mars?",0

Phones and Driving

Modern society and cell phones, its an unbreakable bond, like a child to its mother's hip. There's a big problem with people using smartphones while behind the wheel of an automobile, and its causing wrecks, finder binders, people on the sides of the road to get hit from oncoming traffic, and people walking into the middle of the road while texting. Society has become more and more stuck to their screens. On a daily basis i see people swerve in and out of my lane on the road. Even when riding with my own friends, i constantly tell them to get off their phones, never do they listen.

The people of the world have lost the respect for vehicles that they used to have. We have become accustomed to using technology at all points of our lives. Wrecks happen everyday because someone couldn't wait to see who texted them back. Texting and driving has become a serious issue, with phones getting more and more involved in our lives it is apparent that action needs to be taken. When driving a motor vehicle of any type, a cellphone, tablet, apple watch, or ipod should in no way be able to be used. It puts the public peoples and themselves at risk of death or serious injury.

A law just came out in georgia that is a no hands law, you can not even have your phone in your lap, in your shoulder, definitely not in your hand, and nowhere near your face when driving a vehicle. I believe this should go in effect everywhere, and have some serious reinforcement from the police of society. Without someone to make people think before they act. That song you just couldn't wait to change, or that text that you just had to send, or that snapchat that you had to watch could be the very last thing you do. For the safety of you, and everyone around you please take action.

"What would you do without car usage? Is there such thing as too much or too little car usage? Many residents or travelers are nearby thier destination and don't nessesaraly need a car to get there. Although, for other's they may need to use a car becasue of extended distance. Limiting car usage has many advantages.  For example, in Vauban, Germany streets are completely ""car free"". According to the article "" 70% of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57% sold car's to move here"". Families and friends are much active with each other and can spend more quality time outside of school and work.

When there is less car usage more public transportation will be available to thoose who need it more importantly. Also there would be less polution with the gas and air. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"", said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza. Due to the smog that was in France, car's was banned. ""Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday"", according to the BBC. Fuel is also a great impact. Do you ever feel like you just work hard for nothing? Money is being wasted on gas, car materials, and car details much more then the things it really needs to be spent on.

Limiting car usage could mean less accidents. Less accidents means less deaths and injuries. Driving could be risky especially in crowdy places with people and other cars. Limiting cars could also mean people getting to know diffrent places often and not just the places they are used to going. Parks and sports centers also have had bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramtically cut traffic; and new resturants and upscale shoppung districts have cropped up. Families are more engaged together and work together to make it to thier destination.

In conclusion, Do you feel as if car polution should be limited becasue of all the advatages. Limiting car usage has it advantages and disadvatages. Many things could possibly happen. According to The end of Car Culture article, ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportations traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve recources, lower emissions and improve saftey"". The Mobile World Congress is looking for more saftey ways to transport and get to yout destintation when needed. Due to limiting car-usage families and friends can now spend quality time while getting to thier locations, you can go to your nearby places, you could save more money of gas and car details, and also you could prevent less accidents if possible.",0
"Life has revolved around driving since the termination of World War II. In sources 1 and 4, the authors mention the population's inhabitants have greatly reduced or stopped car usage wholly voluntarily. While in sources 2 and 3, the cities have banned car usage on certain days. The advantages of limiting car usage include less pollution and increased accessibility to the entire city.

Pollution is an large issue in todays world. According to Rosenthal in source 1, ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States P5."" The use of cars has created smog in many large cities. The 2009 Olympics in Bejing required the city to reduce car usage in order to clear the air. Those participating and attending the event were in danger of harming their lungs. The citizens of Bejing has already been noted to wear respirators and other devices to filter the toxins from the air they breathe. In this extreme case, it was mandatory to cut the usage of cars down. But in other cities, they have not reached this extreme and it can be easily prevented by limiting car usage. Duffer mentions the pollution in the skies of the global city of Paris has been noticeably decreasedP19. In another scenario of pollution in the atmosphere, the city has taken initiative to ban cars depending on the number of their license plate. Without the emissions from the cars, the air would be clean to breath and a better sight as well.

The new generation has grown up with cars yet when the time comes to obtain a license, they forgo the opportunity. Selsky says that without cars, the city's parks and sports centers have been heavily visited. The pedestrian walkways and shopping centers have also came in large numbersP28. Due to the abandonment of cars, upscale commerce and new restaurants were constructed. Rather than a large mall near some interstate or other large roadway, shopping districts have transformed into locations in which are near public transportation or in walking distance. Rosenthal shares an anecdote that outlines that public transportation, carpooling, and even walking have replaced the car for himself and his childrenP40. Public transit is not viewed down upon anymore, it is a smarter way of getting from one place to another. Carpooling isn't a desprete call, it is a resource that has become essential and benificial to both parties. A combination of carpooling, walking, and public transit makes the city much easier to access and explore.

The development of cities is no longer based on cars. It is now be based upon the access it will give to those without cars. Limiting the use of cars makes the city improved in many ways. Clean air and more efficient ways of transportation highlights that cars are no longer needed and limiting car usage will have even more advantages in the future.",0
""" During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markests didn't get to see the candidates at all.""-Bradford Plumer. Are society is relaying on this electoral college system, when we don't even know who are those electors. I agree, that we should change our election to a popular vote because people get often confuse to whom their voting for, and it might lead to picking the wrong person that would be helping leading this country. On the other hand, the people that agree on keeping the electoral college system say that "" when you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors."" The majoredy of citizens don't even  know who their voting for, imagine their going to be more lost and eventually ending up voting for the wrong person. The electoral college should be remove for good which will allows to have a stable society.

The Electoral college dosen't allow the candidates to come and visit the states. So, you don't even now who you're voting for."" In 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly suceeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy."" What's the point of having privileges to vote, when the segregationist who elect electors are against the president you voted for. What's happen to having free rights, and be able to vote for who you want, and  knowing that he or she would suceed and  lead our country to the right path. By having the electoral college system it is getting rid of those rights. Also the ""2000 fiasco"" was known as the biggest problems we had in the century. Are goal is improving our country not deteriorating it. If we change our election to a popular vote we wouldn't even be in this mess.

Citizen who agree on keeping the electoral college system say that ""electoral votes induces the candidates as we saw in 2012's election to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states."" What wrong with all the states? Are we not part of this country to? Their focusing all their attention on the states that they would be recieving their votes from. Their not even giving other states an opportunity of getting to know their candidates and what their offering to are country on improving it. Another, example is that the electoral college votes relay on larger states. They do that because they know that all their votes are going to come from the bigger states but that's incorrect they should relay on the whole country completely of getting their votes from.

In conclusion, the",0
"No matter what, everyone will have differnet opinions and views on certain situations. Whether it's about what color a dress is, or who should be president, all views are different. When getting advice it is important to see things from all point of views. Listening to multiple peoples advice is very benificial when it comes to desicion making.

Because of every varied opinion there is never just one option. Having more than one choice can help deduce, and choose an opinion that will benifit you the most. An example would be a friend giving you advice to take a shortcut that they discovered to get to school quicker. Another friend tells you that the shortcut is dangerous and that it's not worth it. Two opposing opinions gives you different chances. Say you don't take the shortcut and it takes you longer to get to school. The next day you can try the shortcut to see if its worth it. If it is then you can take the shortcut from then on, if not you take the normal way to school. If one goes wrong you can always try the other.

No one's perfect and sometimes people give bad advice. Having anothers opinion to compare to the someone else's questionable advice to helps you make a better choice. Maybe you break your relatives special vase so you go to a friend for advice. Your friend might tell you to lie about the vase. Another friend tells you to tell the truth. Having those two contrasting opinions helps you to realize that one might be better than the other.

There is no rule that tells you that you only have to follow a singular person's advice. Only yourself knows you the best, but that doesn't mean there is anything wrong with seeking guidance from others. Someone might tell you to add more vegtables into your diet. Someone else might say to add more fruits to your diet. You don't have to do one or the other, creating a compromise between the two opinions can help you create something that will help you, indvidualy, the most.

In conclusion there is many benefits to getting multiple people's opinions. Every point of view is different. Every person you ask advice from are most likely basing their advice on their own past expiernces. Every expierience differs from one person to another. Making every opinion and view completly unique. Seeing all those diffferent opinions helps you make a choice most beneficial to yourself.",0
"Humans have been curious about what is out beyond the sky for a long time. From ancient Greek and Roman astronomers who thought the Earth was the center of the universe, to Galielio who proved them wrong, humans have been wondering about what is truly out there amoung the heavens and the stars. In the ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author, despite the many harrowing ""challenges"" metioned, strongly and effectively supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit, calling to that innate human want to know.

One way he supports this endavor is through scientific logic. He cites how similar Venus is to earth saying, ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too"". One of the best ways to support a point is through factual evidence. By making clear that Venusian exploration makes logical sense, the author strengthens his argument. The fact that Venus is Earth-like and at times very close distance wise to her, makes exploring Venus seem like the next logical step. This scientific backing gives the mission to know more about Venus crediblity and adds a sense of noblitiy, which makes it seem worthy. Without scientific backing it would seem like a far-fetched dream, unworthy of any time or effort.

The author also effectively supports the exploration of Venus through emotional means. He does this by dangling the possibility of life on Venus. He states,""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life"". It is basic human nature to want to not be alone. The want on community drives humans to great lengths to find others like them. Humans have and contiune to cross oceans, battle fields, and other challenging situations in order to not be by themselves. This pursuit for companionship extends to the exploration of Venus. Despite the temperature of Venus's surface being ""over 800 degrees Fahernheit"" and it having an ""atmospheric pressure ... 90 times greater than [Earth's]"" humans are still trying to think of ways to go there on the slim chance that there might be or might have been life there at one point. All in the hopes that humans might not be so alone in this grand universe. By tapping into the basic need and want to not be alone the author makes a strong case for the worthiness of Venusian exploration because many see the search for other life as noble cause and can relate with it.

Another way the author supports his point is by giving expamples of the progress already made and supplying hope. One of the ""challenges"" Venusian exploration faces is the weather on Venus. Venus has ""eurpting vlocanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strkies"". These condtions would frighten anyone. But to combat them, the author informs the reader about a possible solution proposed by NASA of a ""blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape"". In doing so, the author makes the problems seem easier to solve while at the same time providing hope through a possible solution. By showing that the exploration of Venus might indeed be possible that author is able reenforce the worthiness of pursuing Venus. The question changes from ""Can it be done?"" to ""How should it be done?"" which makes it seem like a worthy adventure. The author also give the pursuit hope by diplaying a possible way for it to actually happan. This can get people excited and add to the fervor and want to find out what Venus is really like.

Through the use of scientific logic, emotional motivation, and inspiring hope, the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is able to take an endavor that seems impossible and turn it into a worthy adventure that many can relate with and want to happen. The author taps into human curiousity and exploits it. In the same way the drive to explore the Moon enabled humans to reach new heights, so to does the author depict the study of Venus an epic mission, worthy of adverse challenges humans will face to accomplish it.",0
"First impressions is what I learn from many people. People have many impressions and yes it is hard to change.

Impressions are special to some people but it also could effect people in certain ways. Ways where your whole behavior might change or attitude or maybe your whole person. When we first meet people we see their first impressions and we see on how they are or we check on how their behavior is. We all have a instict on where we look at some people and judge but we also see the attitude in the people. First impressions are special sometimes because you dont know who you are going to meet next and on how they are good or if they have some bad in them.

Everybody is unique in many different ways. People do say that first impressions is impossible to change. I think it's impossible becuase people are very different everybody is different and sometimes we just have to accept it.

Some people don't understand that some people can't change even if its for the better or the worse some people will just always be the same. Impressions are something you can't change from people.",0
"image having a good skill. like being good at a sport, sing, cooking, or just getting good grades at school.

People can have skill or talent they might not even know they have one. Skill can be anything like being good at math when other people are are not, you might not be good at English but other people are. it does not matter if your not good at something. like you can be good at soccer but be bad at baseball. skill can come in different ways.

like mine. My skill is talking to people. I don't know why I like to talk to other people but i just do. But It can get me in trouble like. When Im doing a test I like to turn around and talk to my friends and i always get in trouble for this. or when Im in class I like to talk to much with my friends and not do my work and sometimes I talk to the teacher for a long time and not do my work. Talking to other people can be a good thing you like not being shy. I used to be shy but i start talking to people and became not being as shy as I used. There are more ways that talking can be good for like building a good friendship with other people like least year. I started talking to other people this year and made a lot of new friends. And you can become best friends with the teacher it a good thing to have a good friendship with the teacher. Talking can help you with making new friends out of school. like at birthday party you can talk to people you don't even know. talking is a good skill to have because. it can help you with the real world. Like when you see some one have a bad day you come and talk to them and make them feel better then they were. my skill can be good or bad at sometime. but that my skill. ",0
"I bielive that this computer system is vauleable because this can tell emotions, it may also help you communicate,and help teachers with students.

This system can reconize your emotions. Many peolpe tend to hide their emotions .In the Mona Lisa she is eighty-three percent happy,nine percent disgusted,six percent fearful,and two percent angry. This computer system software helped the Mona Lisa's emotions,which can help us too. This process begins when the compyter constructs a 3D computer model of the face all fourty four major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Emotion,moving your facialmuscles not only expresses emotions,but it also may even help produce them.

Another reason is this may help you with communication ,this software can help you communicate. In a false smile the mouth is stretched sideways using zygomatic major and a different muscle,the risorius. To an expert,faces don't lie these muscle cluses are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politican or celebrity isnt't being truthful. This helps weather someone fake smiles to you or not. In a real smile the zygomatic major lift the corners of your mouth. This computer system knows if you are faking it.

This software may also help teachers out. This computer system can tell if students are bored in class,or if they are confused .This system can tell teachers that students need more review on the lesson .This may be a great a idea niot only it helps teachers but,human communcation is nonverbal,including emotional communication so computers need to understand that too.

I bielive this is a great idea because,it helps us with our emotions and communicate with others,and help teahers out with students.

This computer software is very benefial for all of us so I agree to this we need to step our game up,and know what peolpe feel by the help of theses great system we have.",0
"This piece is about why scientist should explore Venus. The author supported his or her claim of exploring Venus well. The author provides evidence to counter Venus's harsh conditions.

The author gives many reasons why Venus is a dangerous planet. For example, the author says that there is a thick atmosphere that is 97 percent carbon dioxide, not only that but the clouds are highly corrosive with sulfuric acid. The surface temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the pressure is 90 times that of Earth's. The author also mentions that the geology and weather is chaotic as well. The author manages to give some evidence for each of the dangers of Venus. He or she states that scientists can hover thirty-some miles above the surface to avoid geological and most weather hazards. It is also said that hovering up high will decrease the temperature down to about 170 degrees Fahrenheit and the pressure to Earth's sea level. This gives the idea that a human survivng on Venus is not easy but possible. The author gives that fact that NASA is currently working on electronics that can withstand Venus's surface, and the longest it has lasted is three weeks, so scientists can gather artifacts from Venus and study them.

The author provides evidence in that scientists are currently working to combat Venus's harsh conditions. The evidence present shows that it is possible to counter the planet's harsh conditions and also how close the humans are to being able to explore Venus.",0
The story of Making Mona Lisa Smile is about a Prof named Thomas Huang making a computer that can tell your emotions and the way you are feeling that day. You might not be the mood for anything and the computer can tell when your bored or not feeling anything it will modify the way it work so you will be in a better mood i think its great. Beacuse kids might not fall asleep in class as much if thcomputer sees it and will fix it and it will help whats wrong with people. Part of me say its a bad idea becuase most people dont like talking about their emotions so that will make things worse if a computer does it and feel their emotions . Its pretty cool through how it can read your face and all 44 major muscles on your face. I would say no to it becuase i myself and like telling my emotions about things and dont a computer telling me about them,0
"Do you ever wonder if asking more than one person for advice can help someone make a better choice? I think asking more than one person for advice can help someone make a better choice because they get multiple options to choose from. Another reason why I think asking more than one person for advice can help someone make a better choice is because advice can be hard to get from only one person. Another reason why asking more than one person for advice can help someone make a better choice is because advice from more than one person gives you more advice to think about. Getting advice from more then one person is a better choice because you have multiple options, it can be hard to get from only one person, and it gives you more then one idea.

Asking more than one person for advice can help them make a better choice because they have multiple options to choose from. Having multiple options can help someone make a better choice because they might not agree with someone. It could also help someone because they could choose one that they like and dislike because they have multiple options to choose from. For example if I needed advice for high school and I ask multiple people, I could choose which advise I liked the most. Another example would be If I needed advice on how to get good grades at school and I ask multiple people if I don't agree on what someone else said I could agree with someone else and take their advice.

Advice can be hard to get from only one person because you need to get other people's advice on what you need advice on. Another reason why advice can be hard to get from one person is because you also need to get more than one persons opinion. For example if I ask my friend for advice and she gives advice and I don't like it, I would go to someone else because I didn't like the advice she gave to me. Another example would be if I ask someone for advice and they give it to me and I don't like it I would go to someone else. That is why it's important to get advice from more than one person because you might have not liked the advice someone gave to you so you go to another person.

Getting advice from more then one person gives you more advice ideas to think about. For example if I ask someone for advice and I ask someone else and they both give me great advice I can have two advice to think about. Another example would be I ask multiple people for advice and they give me advice and I like both of the advice multiple advice to think about. Getting more then one opinion can help someone make a better choice because they have more then one advice to think about and they can choose which advice they like the most. Getting advice give you more ideas to think about.

Advice can be hard to choose from, but asking multiple people can make it easy because you have different options to choose from. Sometimes when people give you advice you might not agree with them, but the more people you ask the more advice you get, and the more advice you can choose from. In my opinion asking more than one person for advice is a better choice because you get different answers from people. When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than on person because they need to get more then one opinion. Asking more than one person for advice is a better choice.",0
"For a long time now we have been fighting against global warming and polution. Some people why we cant just end the fight quickly. And the reason is simply because we still rely so much on cars. All people need to find so type of way to stop using cars as much. There are some places that are already starting to limit uses. Like in Vauban, Germany who has a ban on cars, Paris, France who can use certain cars on certain days, and bogota, Colombia.

One way people could limit their use of cars is if they did something like what Vauban, Germany did. Build cities that had no drive ways and no parking lots. That way people had to buy parking garage spots that cost alot of money. According to source one passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse emissions in Europe. Many will think this is not alot but think about how much polution there is, then find out how twelve percent is it will be alot. But when these types of cities are made there will be a reduce in the emissions because little if any cars we be driven here. In source one Heidrun Walter said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" This showes that without cars in people life it removes a tremondus amount of stress. People dont have to worry about spending money on gas or they don't have to worry about paying large amounts of money for their car to be fit. When there is not so much money at stake you tent to be a little less tense. Obvously creating a city were you have to buy a parking garage spot to hold your car would be a great idea because it would reduce the amount of polution being released and it would make the people living in the city less stressed.

Another ways people could limit the use of cars is if they do something like Paris, France does. They placed a ban on cars with odd numbered licens plates on Mondays, And placed a ban on cars with even numbered licens plates on Tuesdays. They did this because they were having record breaking amounts of polution being released. They were releasing more polution than Beijing, China who is the leading city in polution. But according to article two Paris found a sixty percent decrease in polution in just five days of this even odd ban. This means they lost more than half of the cities polution by limiting the cars on Monday to only even licens and limiting the cars to only odd licens on Tuesday. Cleary this is a very effective method of reducing the amount of cars being used.

A third way cars could be used less is if you have no car days like bogota, Colombia has. In article three Carlos Arturo Plaza says ""It's a good way to take away stress and lower air polution."" He is saying that cars a cause for polution and doing this day is a good way of lowering polution rates. This source also stated that other cities in Columbia like Cali and Valledpar are joining in this event. It is also said that other country leaders go to Colombia to watch this event. Afterwards they say the event is awesome. This means that not only is the event spreading across Colombia, but it could possibly spread to other countries as well. Without a doubt this is another effective way to limit the use of cars.

It is clear that cars are a problem. But many people use them anyway, but what they don't think about is how much they are contributing to polution. Some ways to limit car usage are create cities where you have to pay for a place to store you car, have and even odd licens day, and have no car days.",0
"The face on Mars was actually landform on mars and not a face if you still don't believe me I'll tell you some facts. In 1976 viking 1 was snapping pictures so that viking 2 could land while doing that it snapped a picture of a landform that looked like a face. Many people thought that it was a face but it wasn't. In 1998 they took another pivture but this time it didn't look like a face it looked more like a landform on the ground. Many people thought that the landform was created by aliens many others thought that it was made just like land forms on earth.

People still thought thet they were made by aliens many other people disagreed on it until 2001 when they took the final picture and they saw that it was actually a landform Garvin said that it reminded he of snake river of Idaho.

So after that happened mny people saw the truth about the face on mars and completely forgot about it. Some people still believe and talk about it but maybe those people are just the scientists trying to find out if there is more land forms that look just like the onein 1976. Many people say that they might find another one and start the arguement that it's an alien artifact or that it's just a land mass this time. Many other people study about this things and think they find out the truth about ehy this landforms look like faces. Even though some people think there is life on mars some might be true and some of it might be fake. Some people think there is aliens but maybe in another galaxy.

Many people might still think that mars landform was a sign form aliens and saying that they exist personally I don't think there is aliens in mars or any other planet in our solar system. That was just my idea about it I don't think my statement could be true. Maybe smart kid like a nerd would say "" scientists who are studying this kind of martian studies could get results of a real life alien that could be roaming around earth"". That's what I would think a nerd would say or maybe he might just say it even smarter than I said it, but that is my opinion I would like to hear about more peoples opinions on the face on mars. Even though many other people will just argue over that it was a face but maybe the aliens destroyed it or just abducted it like they do in boring fake movies of aliens but that's my opinion not you if you don't agree with me it's fine with me.",0
"As for cell phones, Cell phone use while driving statistics show that how this behavior are common and dangerous for teen drivers. During cell phones while driving, 1.2 million car crashes back in 2013 that involved drivers talking on the phone, and also involving text messaging. Cell phone use while driving statistics and texting and driving facts may help a lot of families manage this dangerous at its risk. Texting while driving and other cell phone use while driving statistics show that this multitasking behind the wheel is becoming threatening norm. Talking or texting while driving or checking on social media post can take your brain off task while driving. Coupled with inexperienced and lack of driving skills, cell phones can be deadly for teen drivers.

Technology will change and new distractions will be introduced, parents need to be sure and be careful and explain to the teens to understand the value of engaged driving, where the driver is continuously attentive and focused. Make a commitment for teens not to use distracting devices while driving. Teens who do not frequently use a phone while driving believe the benefits of putting away their phone while driving any drawbacks. The benefits associated with not using a cell phone that includes, being able to pay better attention, being less likely to crash, and following the law. Texting and driving are really are really unhealthy for teens which can lead to death or a lot of trouble.

According to integrity insurances, traffic safety administration, texting behind the wheel takes a driver's eye off the road for an average of 4.6 seconds, which is the time it takes to go from one end zone to another. Texting while driving has now replaced drinking and driving as the leading cause of death of teenage drivers. Teens are not the only ones that are just guilty. According to the survey, conducted by AT&T, 49 percent of American adult drivers admitted they text while driving. In that same survey, their model predicted text messaging while being involved in 6-60 percent of all accidents in the U.S. High school students who experienced these types of accident are very terrifying for texting and driving. Typing text messages reduce a driver ability at a certain direction to the roadway, to respond to important traffic events and also control a vehicle while in the lane and to also show respect to other vehicles.",0
"Dear state senator,

I think that we should get ride of the elecoral college because its not what people want. The popular votes lets you pick which president you want. The electoral college is when you pick your candidate but your picking a elector and they bring in the votes. The people that vote should be able to pick who they want and then yea. So we should have popular votes then keeping the electoral college. So we need a popular vote and not a electoral college where you dont actually vote, you vote for a elector and then you tell them which candidate you vote for and then they bring in the votes. For exaple, if i would to say that the candiadates are George washington and john kerry and i pick george and 34 others pick him the elector would bring 35 votes to the congress and then he would have 35 votes. You dont know the electors you dont know anything.",0
"The Electoral Collage has been around for a long time. Every few years, voters go to vote on election day and their vote can either mean everything or nothing. There are many flaws with the Electoral Collage: it serves an outdated purpose, popular vote does not matter, and there is the possibility of the disaster factor. Using the Electoral Collage could lead to undesired consequences.

Back in the times in which the Electoral Collage was founded, commutation between the colonies was not quick. News could take months to arrive, and with the Electoral Collage, if news about a presidential candidate came out that made him a threat, for example if he was a murderer, the electors would know that and, despite what the voters thought, not to vote for him. In the current times, as soon as something had happened that would make a candidate look bad, it would not be very long before such news would be on T.V., social media Facebook, Twitter, etc.,and on the radio. So unless someone wasn't paying much attention, every vote should be valid.

With the Electoral Collage system, the vote of an individual does not matter. Whether three people in a state vote or threemillion vote, as long as a majority only 51% of the votes vote for the candidate, that candidate gets all the electoral votes for that state. If only 51% of people vote for a candidate he wins that state, that leaves 49% of people in that state whose votes are now discredited. Eventually, like in some cases such as the election in 2000, it can add up that a candidate wins the popular vote, the actual majority, but not the election. So despite the wishes of the majority, the other candidate in this situation would win.

When a candidate wins all the electoral votes for a state, those votes are sent to electors so that they can vote on behalf of the people, or not. ""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. So that a popular vote for Kennedy.""""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses are wrong,"" Bradford Plumer Not only an incident such as this could occur, but electors of two slates could be sent to congress and chose not to vote as asked. With all these flaws, why are we still using the Electoral Collage?

The Electoral Collage no longer serves the purpose it once did, and it is now doing more harm than good. Back when it was established, it did what was needed for the time. This is a new era, it's time for a new system.",0
"I am agree with students to use their cell phone in the classroom because some students came to the United State with not knowing any words in English, and even of a student that born in the United State or their native language is English can get to forget the meaning of a word in English. For instance, cellphones or another type of device.

And it can drive you to many type of option which is very good! if you are not clear in the first option you can jump to the second option or third option if needed.

Some students came to the United State without speaking English which mean is so bad, and they don't know how to communicate with teachers so they are likely to uses their cellphone for translating words. I was one of the student that came to United State without speaking any English, and teachers can't speak Spanish too, so I was able to use my phone for translate words to my language, it was helping a lot to communicate with other students that only speaks English. In another reason, I daily uses my phone because it is easy to carrying It in the hallway instead of a big dictionary, and some dictionary does not contain the word that you looking for . Beyond of that, in the cellphone you just need to download the dictionary app or go the Google web and type easily the word that you need to fine information for.

Therefore, cellphones can give many way to you how to understand the word specially the Google web site it can give you pictures, or it can led you to a video link where you can see resources that are explaining the meaning of the word or different manner that they can be clear at the point. I use Google a lot of time because has everything that the dictionary can not be included for example, Google translate can tell you the pronunciation, quickly to research, and even if it is bad it will tell you the meaning besides that if you don't know how to spell the word it contains an option where you can talk to the cellphone which is a lovely option to use.

However, cellphones is a almighty thing to be used in the classroom to help students knowledge or everywhere. beside, been smart and having powerful resource we can learn from cellphones to do many things as some teachers want us to use our cellphones for Wikipedia, kahhot , dictionary web, and googlecassroom for reading , writing or gave us homework throw it.

As we can know already cellphone is very useful for this options too. calling ,sending message, receiving message , set remainder, multiple resource, ects.

Despite of each year is advancing many students at the among of age 12 or 15 years old have a phone or a tablet device which is fine to have. Then, If needed teachers can work in an online website to gave them homework to do at home or working in classroom. And some point, approximate all people have their cellphones in their bag, and easy to care and some people have said that the cellphones is like their friend.

finally, which I did understand that cellphones is necessary needed to use in the classroom which is helping to translate word in another language and cellphones can give you many certain information, idea how to be specific in the word that you are looking for. And also, it can have a different variety of information and some teachers will ask for it during the class, if you have one . And is a small size it is easy to carry, And is an important device to carry everywhere.          ",0
"Cell Phones and Driving

Should you be permitted to drive a vehicle while using a device? In this case you shouldn't because it comes with many risks while you're on the road. You put yourself in danger while putting other drivers in danger as well. You risk your life with others on the line too!!!!

To begin with it's a big distraction on the road. When you choose to text and drive, you're threatening every single driver around you and placing more value on that text message than yourself and your fellow drivers. You tend to check your phone so much which can cause you to crash with someone else. But also take the focus of your surroundings while driving. It takes your focus away from safe driving. One single text can make a blink of an eye change your life of someone else's life. Also when you're engulfed in a texting conversation, it's easy to forget you're sharing the road with other people. It also takes your hands off the steering wheel to answer one single text.

Another reason that driving while using a device should be allowed is because it is illegal. You get pulled over and get a ticket. But also if caught many times can cause those digits tickets to go up which means big money tickets. It can also rise in auto insurance rates. It can lead up to prison time as well .Is it worth risking your freedom?

More so, is it worth the emotional damage a car accident causes to everyone involved?

Also it leads to getting your license suspended. The consequences you'll face for texting and driving are similar to those you'd get for another one of the most serious driving offenses which is a DUI.

A third reason that using a device while driving shouldn't be allowed is because it can have huge risks. Sending or replying to a text requires that you remove at least one hand from the steering wheel so that you can grip your phone and thumb in a reply. So not only are you multitasking and not focusing your eyes from the road, but you're also trying to deftly use your phone with one hand while at the same time steer your vehicle. So not only do you risk crashing with other vehicles but also losing the steering wheel which is the control of driving the vehicle.

Being able to use a device while operating a vehicle shouldn't be allowed. It brings too many risks and changes to the environment of driving. There would be a lot of accidents on the highway due to having access to a device while driving. Would you want a family member or friend to be on the road with someone so oblivious to the traffic around them? Remember, every time you get behind the wheel, you're entering a shared experience with mothers, fathers, friends, and children. It is every driver's responsibility to always be careful and attentive, ensuring everyone can safely get from Point A to Point B. Which is why driving with a device on your hand shouldn't be allowed.",0
"Valubale FACS Technology in the Classroom

FACS is an acronym for the new technology named Facial Action Coding System. It enables computers to identify human emotions. This technology is quite interesting and also complex. Dr. Huang predicts ""A classroom computer could recognnize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". He says that by knowing that we as students are bored the computer would ""modify the the lesson like an effective human instructor.""

I believe that FACS, the new technology of facial action coding, would be very effective and valuable in the classroom. I know that as a student reading a so called ""never ending"" article causes me to become sleepy and uninterested. With the modification of the lesson, I think that it will enhance the attention given to the lesson. Students are struggling so much as ADD and ADHD seem to have been on the rise or rather the diagnoses or those things. Students become uninterested when they don't think that it will benefit them or their future and when they have to read a lot of material that's dry. If attention to the lesson is heightened grades will more than likely raise as heighten as well.

In conclusion, I believe that a Facial Action Coding System would be nice to have in the classroom and would bring a lot more interest back into school work. At the end of the article the author stated ""Whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions!"" That being said, I think that another claim could be ""Whoever thought that making faces finally worked after all these years and we get someone who cares enough to make our lessons interesting"". So many students around me and I know that other students in other areas don't even care about school anymore because they don't feel that their opinion about what they learn matters and it's sad that a computer software program has to do it instead of our leaders and teachers but as long as we get what we need and as long and our grades go up I find this FAC system to be amazing software to put into the school systems.",0
"Many people think that this is a alien formed face noooo. I claim that this is a natural landform. We have taken many pictures and it has faded away more every time we take a picture of it. There are some many reasons of how this face was a natural landform.

First, This natrual landform was not form by alein becuase in the pictures you see a small mountain or big hill , but here in the USA, there are many of thoes big hills or small mountains. They are mostly around the American west. It is a lava dome that are on the USA too. and they are the same height. So that face on that hill is not alone.

Next, Another reason on how that natrual landform is natural not made by aliens is that every time we take a picture over the years the face is always fadeding away so if an alien created it why would he just leave it there just to faded away.

They would of kept it alive.

Last, I can see on how somebody could think this was formed by an alien but how do you explain that the eyes are just shadows. They are formed from the nearby rock. Plus the mouth and nose are also formed by the nearby rock shadow. So the mouth, nose and eyes are not really even there they are just shadows

In conclusion, I am telling the alien face that was on mars was just a lava dome. And its eyes nose mouth were just shadows. Plus the picture just started fading away through the years. This is how the Face was not made by aleins but was a natural landform",0
"The Face on Mars is just a natural landform. This is not a face created by aliens. The picture taking in 1998 revealed it was a natural landform, if NASA would have said it was aliens they would recieve more funding, however they said it was an illusion of a face, and in 2001 the picture taken clearly shows that it is a natural landform.

In 1998 NASA captured a pictue of the face as soon as they could get a good shot at it. The picture revealed that it was just a natural landform, just like NASA had said in 1976. Also, when the original picture was taken in 1976 it was revealed to be an illusion of a face by NASA. If NASA chose to call the landform work done by aliens, they would recieve more funding. However, NASA was very truthful in there fundings and they didn't have any reason besides the truth to say it was a natural landform. Finally, the clearest pictue of it taken in 2001 clearly shows a natural landform that couldn't be mistaken for anything else. A quote from the article is,""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters compared to the 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. 'As a rule of thumb, you can dicern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,' he added, 'So, if there where objects in this picture like airplanes... or Egyptian-style pyramids... you could see what they were!'"" This quote proves that the best picture ever taken so far of the Face clearly shows that it is a natural thing. The natural landform could not be mistaken as anything else in the pictures we have.

It is clear that the Face is a natural landform because the picture in 1998 revealed it, NASA comfired it was a natural thing which caused them to not get extra funding, and the picture taken in 2001 is the clearest one we have and it is very obvious that it is a natural landform. These reason show how the Face is a natural landform and not an alien made thing.",0

I know this because in the article it says ""Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds.""

"Scientists are striving to meet the challenge of exploring the dangerous planet of Venus. Scientist believe that long ago Venus may have supported various forms of life. Looking up at Venus from Earth is a safe distance to visualize the planet since it is very challenging to examine it more closely. The author suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. These dangers include the enviroment, but it is worthy pursuit becuase it part of human curiosity, and innovation.

The atmosphere of Venus is very harmful since it is coated by a thick blankets of carbon dioxide, almost 97 percent of the atmosphere is coated.""Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere""(paragraph 3).

The temperature are also extreme on Venus. The average temperatures are over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the pressure is 90 time greater that what we experience on earth. This pressure can crush a submarine. The temperature can liquefy many metals. Venus has eurpting volcanoes, earthquakes, and lightning strikes. Venus is now an inhospital to any form of life.

Human curiosity drives scientist eagerly to explore this planet despite of the many danger is upholds. Many scientist believe that Venus could have a been able to support life long time ago. ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans."" (paragraph 4). Scientists also believe that Venus can be be our nearest option for a planetary visit. NASA has an idea for sending humans to study Venus. Many forms of light cannot penatrate the dense atmosphere so we cannot takepictures, nor can they take rock,gas, or anything else.

Landing and exploring Venus can lead to innovation for humans. NASA is looking for more solution to be able to study Venus. They are testing out old technology so they can combine it with new technology like the computer. These experiences can innovate many other technology so that we can explore venus. In paragraph 7 it states tha ""these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all "".

In conclusion there are many challenges that make things difficult to explore Venus. There is a purpose to explore Venus. NASA is trying to still pursuit solutions to these challenges so that human might actually have a chance to explore this dangerous but amazing planet. So when you look up at the ""Evening Star"" just think about the fasicnating planet that once might have supported life but also remind yourself that this is now a hostile planet that scientist hope that someday they can explore.",0
"All across the globe, a revolutionary idea is being set in motion. The idea of essentially banning cars from the streets has sparked as much interest as it has critics. The automotive industry has been booming since World War 2, and although the positive effects of cars can be seen in our daily lives, we seldom take into consideration of the negative impacts of cars. Effects such as pollution, traffic, and cost have impacted our lives as automotive users, even if we have not realized it.

Pollution is one of the primary concerns of a world that is constantly driving, yet it is something people hardly take into account when driving. In theory that is understandable, considering the last thing a person is thinking about when they're driving is what their car is spitting out into the atmosphere. However pollution doesn't go unnoticed for long. For example, the city of Paris, France enforced a partial driving ban in order to decrease the almost record breaking pollution across the city, stating, ""The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."" The smog did clear from the city and previous driving laws were reinstated, however this shows how car pollution has a negative impact on the world around us.

Another negative impact of driving is traffic. Traffic is a driver's worst nightmare, and it affects all of us at some point in our lives. In Bogota, Columbia, citizens participated in a drivingfree day, where everyone was encouraged to either hike, bike, skate, or use public transportation in order to reach their destination. This event, in which millions of Colombians participated, was reportedly ""leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" This program left a positive mark on the city of Bogota, and will hopefully soon spread to other countries, reducing crowded, traffic filled streets around the world.

The world runs on money, just ask any Wall Street broker. This is a paradox concerning both car owners and people looking to purchase a car. The question remains, if we're all trying to save money, why spend thousands of dollars on a costly car? According to a census taken in 2013, ""Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cashstrapped Americans could not afford cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway."" This shows that the number of people buying cars is steadily decreasing. Another costly problem of cars is fuel. Buying gasoline for your car every week can get incredibly costly, especially when driving a large truck or sports car. This shows how the cost of cars can have a negative impact on our lives.

In conclusion, the use of cars is steadily declining. Cars just aren't a very positive motive for transportation anymore considering the effects of pollution, traffic, and cost that cars produce.",0
"Dear, senator I hereby to inform you that I'm in favor of changing the election by popular vote for the president of the United Staes, the kind we have now. For many reasons we believe the Electoral College should be abolish due to the process of electing the next president. During the Electoral College voters tend to vote but, not vote for the president, but for a slate of electors, who turn to elect the president. We believe that over 60 percent of voters would prefer an election the kind we have now, as I said before. As you know the Electoral College consist of 538 electors, making it a majority of 270 electoral votes to elect the President. Californa, making it the state with the most electoral votes, is a state that could rise a candidates votes, and is considered by the following candidates that California could be an enormous help for the candidate. Many voters have many questions regarless to the Electoral Vote, for example; can voters control whom, their electors vote for? Nor who picks the electors in the 1st place?, These are a few questions that many voters have. I believe we should forment and focous more on the popular vote of those who are qualified citizens. The biggest disaster with the electoral college was when the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century, therefore making state legislatures responsible for picking electors. During an electoral college vote, if the electoral vote ends in a tie, the election would be held in the House of Reprsentatives, whereas state delegations would vote on the president. Candidates don't get to spend time in the states they know, having a chance of not winning. As a result of that, in the 2000 campaign, approximately seventeen states didn't have the oppurtunity to see the candidates. On the other hand the electoral college avoids the problem of elections. Therefore i considerate the electoral collge vote unfair to voters.",0
"When you ask for advice most of the time you usually ask more than one person. It will be better to ask different people to see what their opinion on the situation is. It will probably make you happy with the advice that they will give you. You would have also talked to multiple people and you might agree with what they have said. If you ask multiple people they might help you make a better choice. When you ask for advice it is better when you ask multiple people because some people will be older, some people might know you longer, and you will have different options.

First, on when you ask for advice why it's better to ask older people. For example, they will be more wiser than other people. Another example is, they might have more experience with the situation. Since they are older and they might understand you more. Also, they have more knowledge since they are are older. So they will know more and they will help you more. They will also probably help you make a better choice.

Second, on when you ask for advice why it's better to ask people that know you longer. For example, you probably talk to them all the time because they know you longer. So they will probably have good advice to give you. Another example is, they know you more because they know you more they will give you good advice. Also, you see them all the time. So they can probably tell when you need advice before you know that you need advice.

Lastly, on when you ask people for advice it is better to ask different people because it gives you different options. For example, you will see different peoples points of view in the situation. Another example is, they won't be bias on the advice they will give you. They won't be giving you the advice that you want to hear they will give you the advice that they think is better for you. Also, you will also have different options to choose from.

In conclusion, it is better to ask multiple people for advice because some people will be older, some people might know you longer, and you will have different options of advice. Multiple people will have given you different advice. You will also not be as stressed because you have talked to multiple people and they all gave you advice. You would also probably be more satisfied with the advice people have given you. This is why it's better to ask different people for advice. They will also make sure that you make a better choice with the advice that they gave you.",0
"The Face, a discovery on Mars. It was dicovered on 1976 and it was complicated to predict what it actually was. It was explored when NASA's Viking 1 was snapping photos of possible land places for the ship Viking 2.

When it was revealed to be a natural landform, not everyone was happy with it. The Face should be considered a natural landform.

I claim that it's a natural landform because it can be found on this earth. It wouldn't be a natural landform if it was not possible to find it anywhere. To confirmed it's identity, Mars global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet in September 1997 after 18 years of the discovery. Jim Garvin, chief scientist of NASA's MGS stated, ""We felt is was important to taxpayers. We photographed the Face as soon as could get a good shot at it."" This senteces here shows how important is was to identify the Face.

On April 5, 1998, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture that is ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. After they snapped photos of the Face, it was later revealed to be a natural landform. There was no alien monument after taking a look at the pictures. According to the text, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all"" (Unmasking the Face on Mars,7). Many people disagreed that is wasn't a natural landform, but an alien.

The camera used to take the picture wasn't an ordinary camera. It was the aboslute best camera at that time and it zoom in three times bigger than the pixel size. Some might argue that it could be hidden by a haze or mistaken, but it was looked over for the second time and it was confirmed to be a natural landform twice. If you were to use the camera that they used, you can identify any objects such as an airplane or Eygpt pyramid on Mars.

Overall, the Face is a natural landform. The landform is common around American West. Garvin stated, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" It's comparing a real landform to the Face. The Face today can be considered a natural landform.",0
"Dear State Senator, I think we should get rid of the electoral college because they are unfair. There are only a few reasons to why we need the electoral college. I think we should get rid the college because it is a non democratic method of selecting our president. It should be overruled by declaring the candidate who got the most popular votes. Its the electors who select the president not the people. When you vote, you are actually voting for a slate of electors.

Another reason why would get rid of the electoral college is because of the winner takes all system. Canadiates dont spend time in the states they know have no chance of winning. They only focused on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states did not see the the candidates at all including Rhode Island and South carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets did not see a single campaign.

It can be argued that the electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state, demo crates in texas, or reblicans in California for example. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign thean they would have if the president were picked by popular vote... The voters in presidential elections are people who to want to express a political preferance rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.

Whats wrong the electoral College?

When we are under the electoral College system , voters vot not for the president, but they vote for slate of electors. For example if you lived in texas and wanted to vote for John kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the off chance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to congress and Kerry would get 34 electorial votes. These electors could be anyone not holding public office. Plus voters can not control who the electors vote for. Voters end up getting confused because of the candidates the electors vote for.",0
"As we all know cars are a big part of our society today. However cars have a bigger impact than we think. Some people can't live without there car. Some people can go their whole life without a car. We may not think about it however there are multiple advantages to not using a car. When we limit our car use it saves the earth also it i said that it takes away a heap load of stress and it saves people money. Just think about it, one day without the use of cars. How would that be?

We we think of saving the earth we think of recycling, reusing things, and reducing. Did you know that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gases and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States.(According to ""In German Surburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" By: Elisabeth Rosenthal). In Paris there pollution was almost record setting and so they ordered that even-numbered license plates leave their cars at home or pay a fine of $31. Almost 4000 drivers were fined that day  and 27 got their cars impounded. Most of the cars in Paris are diesel ran so the smog is worse. If they would cut down on their car use it would lower the smog.

You might not think of it but if we limited the use of cars it relieves stress. According to ""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"", In Vauban, Germany they have given up their cars. Vaubans streets are completly car free. 70 percfent of Vauban's families do not own cars ansd 57 percent sold a car to move there. Heidrun Walter said""When I had a car I was always tense. Im much happierthis way"". According to ""Car-free dat in spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky in Bogota,Columbia they have been without cars for 3 years. Also Carlos Arturo Plaza said ""It's a good opportunit totake awat stresss and lower the air pollution"".

According to ""The End of Car Culture"" by: Elisabeth Rosenthal recent studies show that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licences as each year goes by. The number of miles driven in the United States  peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily afterwards, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Adivor Perspectives. People who stopped driving there cars as a result of hard times may not find a reason to go back to driving if they are saving money.

So I believe that they're many reason to have a car. However they're many advantages to limiting your car use. You can think of yourself as doing a good deed to the earth when walking somewhere or riding your bike are catching the bus. You can have a clear mind and seize stressing so much. Also you can save money I think that everybody likes to save money one way or another. Instead of drivng your car to the mall you can save that money and catch the bus to the mall and buy that new purse that you have been dying to get.",0
"There are several advantages of limiting car usage. A couple of them are that there would be less pollution in the air and that communities would be set up different to make it easier to get to places without having to drive to these place you could just walk instead.

One advantage of limiting car usage is that there would be less pollution. Source 4 says, ""If the pattern persits and many sociologists believe it will it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions."" This shows that if you cut out some of your car usage there will be less carbon in the air. Which would lead to less pollution and a better living environment for everybody. Source 3 says, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" The person who said this was talking about the car free day that occurs in Colombia. Going just one day without your car can have an impact on the carbon emissions and help bring down the amount of air pollution in that area.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is new community set ups. Source 1 says, ""But it's basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway."" This shows that the government is willing to set up the community in a different way to limit the amount of car usage on a daily basis. Which also makes your shopping trips more convinant because the stores you need or want to go to are walking distance from your house. Source 3 says, ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. This explains how the city is being remodeled to help encourage people to start using their cars less and to be able to walk to many places instead of driving there by bringing these places closer to their houses.

There are several advantages of limiting car usage. A couple of them are that there would be less pollution in the air and that communities would be set up different to make it easier to get to places without having to drive to these place you could just walk instead.

There are several advantages of limiting car usage. A couple of them are less pollution and new community set ups.",0
"Dear my. senator The Electoral college process consists of 538 electorss. Each electors represents a state and they vote according to what the majority of the people favor. The Electoral college is a fair and honest way of electing the president because each individual has a voice in who is elected by voting for the state electorss.""You help choose your state's electorss when you vote for president because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electorss""Does the Electoral College Work?. This shows how everyone plays a key role in the government and in electing the main person in charge.

Many people may argue that the Electoral college is corrupt because it is a ""nondemocratic"" way of electing a president and that the electorss may not vote in favor of the people's majority. This is true, however,""that trust is rarely betrayed""Does the Electoral College Work?."" It is entirely possible that the winner of the electorsal vote will not win the national poular vote""Does the Electoral College Work?, but this too has rarely happened. We need to continue with the Electoral college process despite a couple rarely occurring cons because all of the reasons to retain this fair system heavily outways the negative. There are five main arguments to continue the use of this justified system.

The first reason is ""certainty of outcome."" A conflict over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is rare and less likely to occur than a dispute over the popular vote. "" The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote""Does the Electoral College Work?. A tie in the nationwide electorsal vote is also highly unlikely to occur.

This second argument is ""Everyone's president."" ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal""Does the Electoral College Work?. This is so the residents of other regions don't feel deserted and that their votes don't count. Every president should have this desirable result so that heshe can be a successful president.

The third main argument is ""Swing States."" ""The winnertakeall mathod of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates to focus their campaign efforts on the tossup states....voters in tossup states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign""Does the Electoral College Work?. These electorsal voters are likely to be the most thoughtful voters and should be able to decide the election.

The fourth reason to retain the Electoral College system is that ""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large statesby population lose by virtue of the malapportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution""Does the Electoral College Work?. A large state would get more attention than a small state and I think that this is fair because the larger states by population should get more votes because they contain more people.

The fifth and final reason that we as a nation should favor the Electoral College is because it ""avoids runoff elections.""The Electoral College avoids the problems of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast""Does the Electoral College Work?. The Electoral College takes the huge pressure off of runoff elections and clearly produces a winner.

I hope that you take into consideration what I said and help the Electoral College continue to thrive over the years because without this system the nation will be in a big dispute. I know that this is the best system for our country and state and I strongly hope that you see that too.",0
"The discovery of the Face on the surface of Mars was thrilling for the public. As a scientest working for NASA, I am constantly debating with others whether or not the Martian mesa commonly referred to as the Face was created by aliens. Many people think that it was created by aliens. However, I disagree with the fact that the Face might have been created by aliens. It is simply another Martian mesa located in the region known as Cydonia.

One of the main reasons the Face was not created by aliens is because there are multiple Martian mesas throughout Cydonia. Martian mesas are commonly found throughout Cydonia, and it would be logical to think that the Face is just another Martian mesa. The only difference between the Face and other Martian mesas is that the Face contains unusual shadows making it look like an actual human face.

Not only are Martian mesas commonly found in Cydonia, pictures taken by spacecrafts have proven that the Martian mesa does not look like a face. Although many people have said that the photo taken by the Viking 1 in 1976 resembles a face, unusual shadows made the Martian mesa take the appearance of a human face. Also, the photo taken in 1976 by the Viking 1 does not have very good resolution. In order to see the Face, the photo taken in 1998 by the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) had to be taken through wispy clouds which has led some skeptics to believe that the alien marking were hidden by haze. However, the photos taken in 2001 by the Mars Global Surveyor are much clearer and have much better resolution. These photos reveal the truth about the Face; it is just another Martian Mesa.

In addition to the fact that the photos reveal the truth, it would be illogical for NASA to keep life on Mars a secret. If NASA was to announce to the public that life on Mars has been found, it would significantly help NASA. More people would support NASA and hope more would be discovered about the life found on Mars and would encourage the government to provide NASA with large amounts of money to learn even more about life on Mars.

Although it would have been cool to know that the Face was created by aliens, there is too much proof to support the fact that it is just another Martian mesa. With such advanced technology in use today, NASA will hopefully make huge discoveries in the near future.",0
"Would you like someone deciding what's best for you or take matter into your own hands? Well in my opinion people should make there own decisions because they can decide how they want things and what makes them happy in there own way even though some would argue that, people should seek guidance from experts and authorities because some times they know whats best for us and our own health. Yes, sometimes when you seek for guidance they help you out a lot and lead you to the right path. They also, help you find whats happy but its not like if your doing it because you want your just doing it to better yourself and your not doing what you want your doing what your told.

Deciding what u want probably is what's best since your going at your own paste, your taking it how you want. your going at your own paste with things. Also, no one can stop you from doing what you believe is best for you. You can find your own ways to cope with things without anyone telling you other wise. Going at your own pace is better then getting rushed, doing what you dont want, and doing what your told even. However, getting help pushes you to do it better.

Seeking guidance isnt bad at all either you get the help you need, you get that push forward to bettering yourself. Sometimes in life there are moments where your not your best help and you need a hand. Theres nothing ever wrong with getting a little help. You sometimes need a hand to understand your values to get to recognize them and meet them.

we all have different life matters because we all dont care about the same thing. we all care about different things. your life important matters are valuable and there something that only you can decide on not any one else. Sure, our values all are different in every type of way thats the reason to why we should decide on our own why our life matters are important. thats why in my opinion people should make there own decisions, find out there matters, what there good at and what the things that they value are.",0
"limiting the usage of cars can solve many things in the world such as lessening the producton of greenhouse gases. it states in the article that greenhouse gases can reach up yo 50% in  some areas of the u. s. when it is only 12% in Europe, these numbers are absolutely insane.

meanwhile in places like BOGOTA, columbia they are taking place in such things as a car free day. the article also states that violators will be fined $25 if they are found driving a car on this day. this is a great way to promote a healthier world. doing this can lessen the ammounts of smog and pollution in the environment. "" its a good oppertunity to take away stress and lower air pollution'' said buisnessman carlos Arturo.

the number of greenhouse gases will continue too rise as the population does. this is due to the number of teens and adults getting their licences and cars. if this doesnt end soon the levels of greenhouse gas woll be extremely high.",0
"Car usage all over the world has reduced and been reducing slowly. Some of the advantages of limiting car usage may be the reducing of pollution or just to save money. Also due to many different reasons, even if it's for their own needs, or to just minimize the pollution going on in different parts of the world. In many places car usage has been being limited for countries all over. If it's China, Spain, Columbia, Paris, Germany, or even the United States of America. Not all countries have taken part in trying to reduce the use of cars to an all time low. That may just be their own choice. While other countries are sure trying to cut the usage of car for a variety of reasons. Some places in the world are doing it so they can cut some of the pollution done to the world. And if you think about it if half of the world tryed as hard as they possibly could to try and minimize pollution the world wouldnt be so pulloted. I know cars aren't the only things that cause pollution, but its a pretty big part of the daily life for any person no matter where they are.

In Vauban, Germany a suburban area has almost completely given up driving and even owning a car. ""Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park"" Rosenthal 2 but it cost a lot of money to even own a parking space. ""Carowners can buy a space, for 40,000, along with a home."" Rosenthal 2 That price may just be enough to keep people from owning a car all together. According to the article "" In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars "" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, 70 percent of vaughn's Families don't even own a car and 57 percent sold a car just to move there. Isn't that crazy? Imagine life without cars, it has advantages and disadvantages of course but advantages can lead to a positive outcome no matter what the reason is. By people in Vauban not owning cars they are most likely saving a lot of money because they don't have to buy the car, pay the ridiculous amount for a parking spot, and pay for the gas thats going to end up pollution the world anyway. Just a few of the many advantages in reducing or cutting out car usage completely.

Due to all the terrible and mass amounts of smog in Paris, France, they enforced a ""partial driving ban to clear the air or global city"" Duffer 10. For example, in this article called "" "" by Robert Duffer, on monday motorist with even numbered license plates were told to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22 euro fine which turns out to be 31 U.S. Dollars. And then the same thing would happen to those whose license plates ended in an odd number the following day. This had to have cut pollution a huge amount. If you think about how many people are living in Paris, and you think about them all staying off the road due to a ban then you may be able to understand the amount of pollution that wasn't produced during this ban. Now Paris, did this for the advantage purpose of reducing the amount of pollution they had in their air and by not adding more to it. It couldn't have a negative impact they were doing something good for the enviornment even if it didn't really help that much. Out of the whole city of Paris about ""4,000 drivers were fined,"" and ""27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine"" Duffer 12. Another advantage that Paris had due to them banning car usage was that ""Congestion was down 60 percent"" Duffer 14. The ruling French lifted the ban when the smog cleared up enough.

Bogota, Columbia turned what they did as a tradition, into a big hit to tons of poeple in other countries. "" Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota "" by Andrew Selsky informed the public about what was started a few years ago back in Columbia.

For a day cars except for buses and taxis were banned. In the city of ""7 million, the goal is to promote alternative transportation and also reduce smog. Violators faced 25 fines."" Selsky 21 Due the day without cars, the city of Bogotas has ""118 MILES of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American City."" Selsky 27 One advantage they had was that because of the day with out cars the parks and sports centers have been in the best shape they could possibly be in. They also did have to reduced the amount of pollution that was being put into the air, because it was such a big hit to other cities and countries.

Yet another article by Elisabeth Rosenthal called "" "", is stating the advantages in the United States and what has happened with the reducing of cars. ""Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" Rosenthal 29 The minimizing of cars in The U.S. has some advantages those being, ""Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions"" Rosenthal 29. New York City for example is home to the heart of public transportation due to all the taxis and the subway. Not many people in New York city drive or even own a car due to the congested streets, and the ridiculous amount of money you have to have just to park it like it was in Germany. Crazy amounts of money to park a car is just an outrage. The advantage here would be the money saved by not even owning a car and storing it. Another one would be the traffic is bad but not as bad as it would be if more people had cars. Public transportation is huge in New York. It's already expensive enough to live in New York imagine if there werent as many taxis and if the subway wasn't there at all. Picture all the pollution there would be.

To wrap up everything, as stated there are many advantages to reducing car usage all around the world. If it was to reduce smog or pollution of just to save money they are still advantages to decreasing the amount of times you use a car. If something is in walking distances why not just walk instead of taking a car and wasting money and also polluting the air unless it's a hybrid. The limiting of car usage is slowly but surely growing all over the world. Yes, cars are faster to get places, but why waste the money and clean air to be somewhere quickly? Think of all the advantages there are in reducing car usage not the disadvantages.",0
"The Electoral College is a process which occurs in the United States to help determine the president for the next four years of the entire nation. It is a very controversial topic and a plethora of people want to disregard the Electoral College. People want to vote for their president, but ultimately they are voting for the electors of the state who represent the president in the end. The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. It makes the voters feel like they have less power when they are voting and when people of a nation feel that way, they lose interest and lose the desire to vote for their country because they feel like their vote will not count or have and affect.

At the end of paragraph 10, two questions are asked, ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for?"" and ""Do voters get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate?"". The answers werenot always and sometimes. If a system or process confuses people enough where they vote for the wrong candidate they desired, then that system needs to go. That system is the Electoral College.

The single best argument against the electoral college is the disaster factor. With a name like that, you know this system cannot be good. Also, 3 high ranking officials and a couple of them that opposed the electoral college, were former presidents. They were Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole. The electoral confused system works like this. Voters vote for a slate of electors who in turn are the ones who elect the president. Is'nt the whole point of the election to vote for your candidate that you would like to win, and not his employees'? When a state votes for a president and has their majority vote, then the amount of electors in the state are what counts towards the voting polls. The state electors could be anyone not holding office at that time. Furthermore, electoral votes can possible end in a tie due to the fact that there is an even number of electors, 568, which is a big worry in the result of the election. Compared to electoral votes, there is only 55 representatives in California, but there is 35 million people in the state. A tie almost guaranteed, will not happen with that comparison.

A winner take all system is in play with the electoral college process. The system consists of when a president wins an election then all electors part or even somewhat representing that candidate are now with the president. Also bigger states have more representatives and the candidates focus more on those states to try and win them over. it leaves the smaller states like Wyoming and South Dakota, for example, to be left out of the equation and not be focused on too much in the process.

All in all, the elctorall college and process needs to be abolished and is not fair to the people of the nation voting and being taken advantage of.",0
"The author supports this idea by giving us multiple details about venus. Venus is a planet in our solar system and it is the second planet from our sun. It is proved that Venus is a challenging place to examine closely because it has a lot of stuff that humans can not experience. Venus is a challenging planet for human to study closely because there are stuff that are extremely dangerous for humans and that humans can not do such as: Venus is not always close to Earth, the temperature and atmosphere is greater than what we experienced in Earth and it's danger to get to Venus.

Venus moves a lot from us or we move a lot from venus. There are differences from Venus and us what I mean with that is that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus. In paragraph 2, the authors said humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. Each previous mission was unmanned, and that there is not a single spaceship that has survived the landing for more than a few hours and has touched down on Venus in more than three decades.

The temperature and atmosphere in Venus is greater than in Earth. Humans can not survived or experienced this because they would problably died. In paragraph three, it says that in venus is a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxiude and that the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than we experience in Earth. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. These things makes it more challenging for humans.

Trying to get to Venus is very dangerous for humans since we don't have resistents tools to go there and survived. In paragraph 5 , it says that the Nasa is working in possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus and they tought and allowed scientists to float above the fray. Like imagine a jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, it is still dangerous but it is survivable for humans.

In conclusion, Venus is a very challenging planet for humans to study because there are a lot of barriers that stop humans from getting more closer.",0
"My fellow citizens, allow me to make an urgent announcement. Stop with the constant use of cars. It's damaging not only us, but the environment. We live in aworld where cars are now becoming a major trend, and we're driving them more and more. If we keep drawing that pattern, we won't have a stable world to live in.

I'm not saying to completely stop using your vehicles, although we might see a larger change than expected, what I'm saying is to manage your car usage wisely. Every time we pick up the keys, start our engine and take off to the nearest grocery store, we add a larger threat to the environment. In 'Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog' by Robert Duffer, it informs of the enforcement France is taking to clean up it's polluted cities. Duffer shows us how ""the smog"" that invades the city became a rival to Beijing, China, which is known as the most polluted cities in the world. Imagine going outside to see the beautiful sun, and instead open the door to cars delivering blinding ""smog."" We can't allow ourselves to become the most polluted cities, and the first step is to manage ourselves with our cars.

There's some of us who suffer from stress and anxiety. There's some of us who look at our community and are probably never wanting to go outside again. That is not a community to live in. We deserve to feel relieved, relaxed, and renewed from time to time. In 'Car-Free Day Is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota' by Andrew Selsky, it demonstrates a perfect example. Selsky writes about a ""Car-Free"" day in Bogota, Columbia, and a man shares his side of this event. Carlos Arturo Plaza tells us, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air polluton."" Selsky writes in paragraph 28 the benefits of this event. He writes, ""Parks and sport centers bloomed... Dramatically cut traffic... New restaurants and shopping districts developed."" Look what we can accomplish from not using our cars as much.

We're in a time where money is the top priority in our lives. All those gas prices, and the car insurance car owners must pay is ridiculous. Sometimes people can't even sleep at night due to all the thinking of ""how will I pay this?"", or ""how will I pay that?"" It later becomes a constant battle. This is when technology comes in handy. Now with the common ""Facebook"" and other social media, we're able to connect more and more. It's sad to see people waste their money going to a friends house for probably an hour or so, when they can just talk virtually. Elisabeth Rosenthal, writer of 'The End of Car Culture,' most likely will agree with me. Rosenthal inputs Mimi Sheller's say in all this. Sheller is a sociology professor at Drexel University, and she cites important factors on paragraph 35. ""Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends."" Why drive and pay for gas when you can get on the web? You'll be glad you did.

Now, many will be able to disagree with me saying that, ""we need cars to drive long distances,"" or, ""I rather pay and have my own privacy then be with twenty people I don't know on a bus."" That's fine. I'm not saying to wipe out the fact that you have a car, all I'm saying is to use it wisely. Drive long distances, not short ones that can take you ten minutes to walk. ""What about the people who work in car companies?"" Well, if we all followed what Bogota is doing and develop shopping districts and renewal companies, I'm sure there will be many jobs available. No matter the pay, you'll still have no worry about your automobile bills, which will help you save a huge amount of money. We need to save ourselves from driving and polluting the earth, or else we won't have a great life to live. Blinding smog will cover the sky, and many won't be able to enjoy the rich outside there once was. All we will see are streets instead of parks. We need to stop ourselves from driving too much in order to live to the fullest.",0
"THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE

The Electoral College is somewhere they vote for President and Vice President and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. A majority of 270 electors votes is also required to elect the President. The 23rd Amendment of the Constitution is the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and they treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. After the presidential election, your governor prepares a ''Certicate of Ascertainment'' listing all the candidates who had ran for President in your state along with the names their respective electors.

The thing thats wrong with the electoral college is that the single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election in a century to the system that allows for much worse. Because each state casts only one vote to the single representatives from California to who the represent 35 million voters. The best arguments in favor mostly assertions without much basis  in the reality. But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote the party's nominee is possible that the winner of the electoral vote not win the national popular votes..",0
"First of all studying venus isn't a bad idea wanting to explore the deepest point of venus can change history and life, we can figure out many secrets that venus has and what kind of life form could be on venus because in every planet their's always something that hasn't been discovered. Venus is a planet that will soon be explored NASA has been sending spacecrafts to land on venus but they still don't make it,

For three decades many factors contribute to venus reputation and has been a challenge for humans to study, even thoe 97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets venus and clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus atmosphere and a temperature of 800 degrees fahrenheit and atmospheric pressure that is 90 times greater than what we expirence on earth those conditions are way to extreme that humans don't encounter that on earth

Another reason why it should be studied more and have future plans that someday people from NASA will land is that because many astronomers believe that venus may have once been the most earth-like planet in our solar system and that venus was onced probably covered largely with oceans and could've been many forms of life in venus many many years ago.

Many scientist are looking for a way to get samples of rocks,gas,or anthing else that they can use to find out more about venus but they cannot do that. many researchers are working on innovations that will allow machines to last longer so they can get enough samples for them.

Overall i think that finding new ways to explore and studie venus is a great idea i think that will change history maybe in the future venus can become our second home if we find out more about it and venus will soon be an explored planet and hope that will continue with other planets.",0
"Although you have made good points concerning the landform on Mars, I would like to respectfuly disagree on your opinion that aliens are responsible for the bulilding of Cydonia.

In the passage, ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"", the author has quotes comparing the face, Cydonia, to natrual landforms on earth such as moutains and messas. Through the passage and its comparrisons, we can infer that the ""face"" on Mars is, in face, just made up of natrual causes and the impact of the weather. If you really think and dig deeper, the picture of the face could resemble moutains or small hills posted, or positioned, relativly close together so that the image of a face is possible.

Lastly, the reason as to why Cydonia is in fact just a landform is the way that the author writes the passage. NASA very briefly mentions the possible outcome of aliens, but other than that nothing else has been said about the ""could be"" creatures. They must not be firm believers. Which leads me to the conclusion that is, if NASA had discovered aliens wouldn't that make them most popular? The discovery of new life would, without a doubt, be absolutly fantastic for NASA and its image. The thought that there might be life on Mars is a good enough situatiion to lie and say that you did find life only to have your buisness in the tabloids. We can all infer that is if NASA had discovered that Cydonia had been built by aliens American citizens would be the first to know. You cant hide something like this that would make your buisness so sucsessful.

In conclusion, we can infer that Cydonia is, in fact, a landform of some sort on the face of Mars. We know this through the discussion that landforms are built with natrual causes, not aliens, and that if the face were to be built by aliens it wouldn't be hidden from citizens knowing that the discovery could boom multiple buisnesses.",0
"About twenty five years ago, the Face was first discovered by Viking 2 while it was circling Mars taking pictures. NASA got the pictures and released them days after the mysterious rock was found. The Face settles in the region of Cydonia on Mars.

People think that the Face is created by aliens because the rock formation looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh; however, it is not. Arguements about the Face have been going on since the first picture was released. I'm here to tell you that the Face is 100% a natural landform.

When people argue about the miraculous rock formation, they say that there was or is life on Mars and that the aliens built the Face because it appears to have a mouth, nose, and eyes.

Some questions we get a lot are ""How did it get there?"", ""Why does it have a human face?"", and ""How did it naturally get prominent face features of a human?"" We do not 100% know how the Face got its human feature, but through all of the tests we have done on Mars, there are no aliens found and that the Face is just a fantasic natural made wonder of space.

When I get more informtion about the Face, I will certainally let you know!",0
"""Whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions (Nick D'Alto)."" Having the technology to read student emotions in class is not valuable because it would cost a fortune and it would be a distraction.

The software to detect the emotions of students would be too expensive and that makes the Facial Action Coding System not valuable. ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile (Nick D'Alto)."" Most schools have standard home computers in class, which means the school will spend a fortune to replace the old computers with new and more powerful computers. After replacing the computers schools will still have to buy the Facial Action Coding System, which will most like cost alot of money that could be used for other things.

Another reason the Facial Action Coding System is not valuable is because it would be a distraction in a classroom. ""Empathy (feeling someone else's emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions (Nick D'Alto)."" After being told one student's emotion the other students in that class will unconsciously feel that emotion and distracting them for their lesson.

The Facial Action Coding System is not valuable in schools because it is a distraction and it would cost a fortune to install. There is no need for a computer to tell a student's emotion in class.",0
"Would it be safe to travle to Venus or what about to colect some samples of Venus like rocks,gasses or other things in Venus? Have people wounder how is Venus and is it simliller or different to Earth? We know that Venus is a planet and that Venus is closest to Earth but some poeple might not know how danger Venus has. Has any people or a ship landed on Venus or expernece how Venus feels or looks like on ground. Is it is real worth going to Venus and expercence there conditions or find any life forms in Venus?

Venus Is a similler planet like Earth but only its density and size of the planet. Venus Is a Extreme planet, the conditions on Venus are bad, in Venus almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets Venus. The clouds in Venus are different, there clouds of highly corrosive sulfuir acid is in the atmosphere. On Venus the surface temperatuer avage is 800 degrees Fahreanheit acording to the artical. Those are some extreme temperatuers for a human and for a space craft to be stay in Venus. In Venus the pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience in Earth, humans or machines can not with stand the heat or pressure of the atmosphere.

Humands cant live in these types of conditions like Venus has a person can end up dead and a machien or a ship can melt. No even a space ship or human landed on Venus in these types of conditions. Samples have not even been taken like rocks or gases because of these conditions in Venus. These types of misions can be super risky to do becasue of they extreme conditions the planet has. Earth and Venus are different, Earth has less extreme conditions than Venus dose but later on NASA is trying to find ways to see how they can have protection on there spacce ships and people to try to get some samples from Venus.

This is why and how dangerous Venus can be and how there condtions are extreme. Peopel would not risk dying to get some samples from Venus or try to go to

Venus. This why its not worth to study and analize samples of Venus and later on they can try to find better material or things to help out the space ship and humans to try to land or analize any samples from Venus.",0
"Imagine getting off work on a Friday at five o'clock, there's no bumper to bumper traffic, no horns honking at each other, and no stressful commutes home. This is unimaginable for people who reside in the U.S., but people in parts of Europe live like that every day. There are many advantages to cutting down on car usage.

One advantage to this cut would be that you would be saving money. Many people who drive tend to get in accidents or get pulled over by police for speeding. These incidents are very costly and come with repercussions if you don't pay them. Another way you would be saving money is not having to pay for gas. Gas may be only $2.00 for now, but when those prices go on that incline again it becomes very costly to fill up the tank. If you can't afford to fill up your tank then you will be putting wear and tear on the car which leads to more more money being spent to maintnance it. Alternate transportation that's more cost efficient is taking the city bus. It costs about $1 to get from point A to point B where it would cost you about $6 in gas to get you to the same place. You could also purchase a bicycle to take you where you need to go. Maintnancing a bike is a lot cheaper than a car.

A second advantage that limiting car usage has is that it eliminates pollution. A car gives off sound, light, and air pollution which all effect our ecosystem whether you notice it or not. The U.S may not have as much air pollution as other countries but with the increase in car purchases it could get worse. I'm not saying youn have to completely get rid of your vehicles, but maybe the license plate bill may work. Every other day only license plates that begin or end with odd numbers could drive, and on the days the odds can't drive we allow the plates with the even numbers to drive. People could car pool with co-workers on the days that whoever has those plates can drive. We just need to start taking percausions on our car usage.

In the car free test cities people are overall happier because they aren't so stressed worrying about being late due to traffic or getting in an accident. Driving can be extremely stressful especially with the many things that can distract people so easily. These distractions can lead to accidents or just more stress. "" 'When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way' said Heidrun Walter, mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children driwn out the distant motor.""(Source 1, Paragraph 3, Lines 4-11) This quote puts an image in my mind that is happy and stress free. Imagine how happy you would be if everything was conviently close to youer home and you could enjoy walks or biek rides places with your kids.

People should take a moment and think about ehat life without depending on cars would be like. Would you be healthier, happier, or not? Just take into consideration how you would live and be if we didn't have to rely on cars.",0
"The electoral college is a bad thing because voters aren't voting directly for the candidates. Voters are only voting for a slate of electors that then vote for a president. Uninformed people might be mislead as to what they are actually voting for. The election should be changed to popular vote because the electoral college is not voting directly on a matter.

While big states have more say in what happens, small states were created to have just as much power. There are few states with over twenty electoral votes, and twenty votes is a lot. But, there are far more small statesin terms of population than big states. Having many states with only 716 beats few big states with 2055. Some candidates won the popular vote, but lost the electoral vote due to what states they were popular in. This sways the actual results of voting and messes up what should be based on raw voting numbers. Having electors making the desision for the state is another reason why certain candidates lose.

Some people in America don't know the difference between the popular vote and electoral vote. This can result in people being mislead. If a candidate were to visit California and make a good impression, that state would have a higher chance of being in that candidates favor. If another candidate were to go to Montana, make a good impression just like the first one, he would have the advantage for that state. Both candidates put in the same effort, but the first one would have many more electoral votes than the second mainly because of how electoral votes work.

The winner takes all rule is also in some way bad. Candidates would be competing over larger states like California and New York, If the voting within that state came down to a 49 to 51 percent vote, one candidate would be so close but acheive absoloutly nothing. Each candidate SHOULD get whatever votes they earned to make the voting the way it should be and more fair.

The electoral college is in many ways imperfect, which is why popular vote would be more efficient and more of an actual competition. Popular vote is also a way to make voting simple.",0
"dear state senator, As you know America is very different from other countries. We are known as the land of the free, but then why cant we the people choose our president? The electoral college takes that right away from us. Americans have the right to vote so why would we be ignored and have our vote discarded. Many people dont agree with the electoral college system becase it strips people of their say and opinion in politics theres also the possibility of what people call a diastor factor. Despite it not being the best way to choose a president there are some pros to using the electoral college system, for instance runoff elections, where the amount of popular votes are too close or when ""no candidate recieves a majority of votes cast"" sited from source 3 but then again thats very rare.

The electoral college has someone voting in our places. A state representative cant say yes to all the candidates so why are they choosing for us we know who we want in office we as americans have a voice and a say in who is our leader. The amount of votes depends on how many people live in each state but ""because each state casts only one vote,the single representative from wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, woud have as much say as the 55 representatives from california who represent 35 million voters"" as sited from source 2 with all representatives choosing the same candidate how can you expect them to reflect the will of the people?

disaster factors are the best argument againt the electoral college ""back in 1960 segragationists in the louisiana legislator nearly succeeded in replacing the democratic electors with new electors who would oppose john f kennedy so that a popular vote for kennedy would not have actually gone to kennedy "" thers also the fact that ""in the same vein and faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for whomever they please""as both sited from source 2 these disaster factors just prove how the electoral college can fail to choose a candidate fairly.

To summarize i would like to restate that the electoral college takes away americans freedom of choice,it also does not allow people to choose who they think would help benefit our country,and the chance of disaster factors it could brings into play.",0
"Is limiting car usage a benefitial way to reduce many uneccessary smog and pollution in any part of the world? This is a case of many opinions. Many people say it is beneficial to the environment and where they live in. Others disagree about limiting car usage due to slow mobility going from place to place that might be far away. In my opinion, i do support the idea that limiting car usage is a helpful way to reduce smog and many other pollutants that might spread in the natural world. For example, reducing smog from the air helps animals and humans to breath better air and reduces the risk factor of getting a decease from the pollution or smog. Also, it just not only cleans the air but it helps citizens live a helathier life by always staying physically active either going from place to place.

It is a great way to reduce smog or pollution by limitng car usage and helps stop cars and truscks to stop generating many malitiant gases that may cause deceases. According to Source #3, its states that ""Millions of columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day."" This is a great example and idea of living in an environment that has reduced the amount of pollution generated by cars and trucks. Not using cars can also help the animals in the environment they live in. Animals also have a roll

Penultimately, the limiting of car usage also helps citizens live a healthier life by staying physically active and helps them stay in shape. Doing exercise everyday can also help reduce the risk factor of getting inmobile. Transportation like walking and jogging to places and not using mechanical transportation is the best way due to the fact that we dont produce pollution or smog.

Finally, limiting the car usage  can help reduce pollution and smog for many reasons. It can help the environment we live in and helps citizens stay physically active and healthy. It also helps animals live better due to the air they breathe. We need to take part on cleaning the place we live in and so if we caused smog and pollution into the air, Why not make a change and reduce what we already created?",0
"Kids across America probably know someone who looks or acts like they are depressed, but when they ask what is wrong they usually say they are fine or nothing is wrong and they will try to continue their day. Having a Facial Action Coding System inside of schools would benefit many schools and people. If schools had this and staff heard about a kid who is not looking mentally well they can have the kid go through the system and if anything is wrong they could give the kid the help he or she needs.

The child will not be able to slide past the system with a fake smile either because in paragraph 7 the FACS can detect the difference between a forced smile and a genuine smile making it harder for you to slip passed the system. The FACS does not always have to be used to see if a child feels bad and needs help. In paragraph 6 Dr. Haung says that if a child was on a computer the computer could recognize if the student was confused or bored. This could benefit kids greatly because sometimes kids are afraid to ask questions in front of the class, but if this was set up to where the teachers were alerted when a kid was confused the teacher could just walk over to the child and ask what they were confused about and asses the problem right where the kid is sitting.

In conclusion having the FACS in schools would benefit kids and teachers greatly because they could see how their students are feeling and if they are confused in anyway, and they could see what the problem is and how they could fix it whenever they need to.",0

The article isayis,""Can voteris control whom their electoris vote for? Not alwayis. Do voteris isometimeis get confuised about the electoris and vote for the wrong candidate? isometimeis."" If the electoris are the oneis chooising who the next preisident iis going to be, then there iis no reaison why the people are voting if their voteis don't count. The people are not able to decide whom their next preisident iis going to be. Moreover, who are theise iso called electoris? Stated in isource 2 under ""What'is wrong with the electoral college"" it talkis about whom the electoris are. The article isayis "" Back in 1960, isegragationiistisin the Louiisiana legiislature nearly isucceede in replacing the Democratic electoris with new electoris who would oppoise Jonh F. Kennedy. In the isame vein,""faithleisis"" electoris have occaisionally refuised to vote for thier party""is candidate and caist a deciding vote for whomever they pleaise...""Baisically what they are isaying hear iis that the electoral are random people who actual vote countis inistead of youris'. Doeis that isound correct to you? Normal people from around your claisis or any get actual count on their vote, what happened to, ""All men are created equal"". Congreisis iis letting other people decide for you, nobody elise but you knowis what your deciisonis in isociety are. Not even electoris ,A.K.A randon beingis. Ais isaid before thiis goeis againist what our founding fatheris would actually want that iis why it ishould be aboliished.

Secondly, the Electoral college hais cauised variouis problemis in previouis hiistory before. In isource 2 it talkis about how congreisis made an error. The article isayis"" Whaqt iis a istate isendis two istaeis of electoris to congreisis? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice preisident Richard Nixon, who wais preisiding over the Senate, Validated only hiis oppenet'is electoris, but he made isure to do iso..."" doeisnt that iseem a bit fiishy to you. He validated the other candidateis elector voteis, why not hiis? Congreisis hais been cheating uis with thiis law. It hais been controlling and deciding who maybe in power. Furthermore, in the isame article it talkis about how the electoral college isyistem focuiseis on a winner take all isyistem. The article isayis,"" Becauise of the winner take all isyistem in each istate, candidateis do't ispend time in istateis they know they have no chance of winning, focuising only on the tight raceis in the ""iswing"" istateis...""you isee how on fair thiis law iis? It doeisnt even acknowledge ismall istateis to vote not even the electoris. There iis nothing fair about thiis act and I damned for it to be aboliisehd.

In concluisin the electoral college act iis ufair and hais cauised for election to be a haisisle. And only that but ""We the people"" and ""All men are created equal"" doeis not count in thiis law. iso yeah, moist devinetly it ishould be aboliished.",0
"Why would people use this type of technology to read students emotions and why is it valuable. I'll tell you why it's valuable. I'll also tell you if it's wrong to do this. I'll tell you if it's right to do this.

I think this type of technology is great to read students facial expressions. Because if a student is feeling sad and the school didn't know the school can help that kid if there is something wrong. They could figure out weather that kid is always bored in a certain class so maybe the teacher can make the class funner. They can use this technology to see if a kid is angry in a certain class and that the school can ask why the student gets so angry in that class like is he getting bullied or he just hates the class. Im all for this technology i think it's really cool.

But there are also the negatives to this technology. Lets say a student dosent want anyone to watch him when he's trying to do work or when he's at home doing stuff. Students don't want their privacy invaded. If students don't want people to know what feelings they are going thorugh then maybe they should'nt do this.

That is my opinion on this new technology. I don't know if it's wrong to do this or if it's the right thing to do. I think they should take a vote if students want this or not.",0
"Well i think we choose our own character traits,because its up to you what you want to do, we choose if we want to be happy,sad,or angry. I've learned that with my mom,she always tells me,""you choose to be happy,sad,angry""

Sometimes our character is formed by influences beyond our control,and that's okay everyone has diffrent reasons to be mad or to be sad,happy but we can change it if we want to. The British naturalism and politician John Lunnock was right about what he wrote,this helps a lot of people to understand that if someone do,did,say,or have said something to you ,it'll be our choice to get mad,sad,or just ignore what happened..

After that your character it'll be what you choose to make it.

For example,i've been trought a lot this past years ,my chilhood was not the best i did not had a father or my mom when i was a little girl,i grew up with my grandparents my uncle raped me when i was seven years old,my other unclu he used to hit me all the time in my head,my grandma used to hit me with the belt , i was fat when i was a little girl,and people used to make fun of me,

That really affect me ,because i'm unsecure about my body,or how i look,i've in Hospitals because i try to kill myself last year,because i was depressed,because all the things that i've been trought and now i choose to be happy,im going to therapits on Monday's,i started working ,i play soccer,or i go out with my sister.

I have choose to be happy .

Sometimes it's hard to be happy,even that you know you want to be happy you just don't see one reason to be,and it's sad because you know your family it's feeling the same pain you feel inside of you ,the only thing you think in those moments are, ""why would i do this"" or ""why am i trying so hard "" .

Those are the worst feelings,when you want to get up in the morning but you can't.

In conclusion,my opinion it's that everyone needs to know that ,our character will be what we choose to make ,we have to make good decisions to be good.",0
"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author says that Venus is important to study. However, the author mostly talks of how we could explore Venus rather than tell us why its important to, but never addresses why its important.

In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author mainly talks of how we would be able to explore Venus but, never really explains why it's more important than another planet that we can actually explore such as mars. On Venus the atmosphere is mainly made up of carbon dioxide a compund that is highly poisonious to humans. Without oxygen present the explorers would have to carry oxygen tanks around that only last for a short amount of time. This means we would have to use rovers to explore the surface until we find a way to be able have more oxygen to be able to explore longer. Another problem that rises to the occasion is the unbearable heat, storms, and natural disastors happening constantly on Venus. With all these problems a rover wouldn't be able to last more than a few hours. Meaning this ""important study"" is not only a waste of valuable time but money that can be used on projects that would be more completable such as putting a person or group on mars.

The author states that despite all the dangers present it's still a worthy presuit. Lets say in 20 years we found a way around all of that and landed a rover on Venus that was capable of lasting a month. The rover goes around takes samples of rocks but sees nothing that was really astonashing, now imagine those rock samples match some of those on earth. Thats great we found a link to the past, but thats nothing to go crazy over we still have other problems such as putting humans on there that are able to bear the uninhabitale conditons and bringing machines and technology over to do more studies that will show why it was important to get to Venus.

Overall, the author doesn't explain why it's important they just state it. All the problems brought up were unable to be addressed and it just sounds like a bigger waste of time and money as the author goes on, because we do not know whats out there. There could be noting and there could be something we just dont know. The author doesn't state any evidence as of why its important therefore the author doesn't support there idea.",0
"Car usage around the world is causing an increase in pollution, greenhouse gas, and obesity. Cities have had to shut down roads and ban driving just to clear the pollution in the air due to car usage.

This is why the world must put limitations on car usage. If we limit the usage of cars we will be rewarded with numerous benefits, such as: better health, clean cities, and new relationships, in turn.

""But cars take us everywhere we need to go and fast! Why should we not use them?!"" Many people exclaim when first hearing about this idea. While getting to your destination fast, you begin to speed up everything around you. Trying to get everything over with as fast as possible. For example, a teenager is driving home, he notices he has 5 extra minutes because he was speeding, and he feels hungry. So what will he do? He will go drive through a McDonalds and get his dinner. Now, not only has he added to greenhouse gas and the pollution of his city, he is also polluting his body. Another downfall of the use of cars is safety. Millions of car accidents happen every single year killing thousands of people. Cars give stupid people too much power and speed then they need. You would not experience a bike crash or public transit bus crash as often as you would a car crash. Cars don`t just affect personal safety, they endanger your city. Driving hundreds of cars around one area will definitely lead to the collection of fuel emissions ehich in turn produces smog. Paris, France had to put a restriction on car usage because of the fact that the city`s air was covered in smog. Who on earth wants to live in a city of smog. The restriction acted as a test, to see if they could omit fuel emissions and help reduce the smog. So, one day all the even licensed plates were banned from driving while, the next day all the odds were banned from driving. This plan worked so well it didn`t last more than a couple of days. Car usage is a big issue worldwide and it needs to be stopped.

""Wouldn`t the limitation of car usage be a waste of cars?"" No. the answer is plain and simple no. Countries worldwide are taking action to wean people off of using personal cars. In Bogota Colombia, they have the Day Without Cars, a holiday in which you can not, at any time , use your automobile. The city of 7 million all use bicycles, and other forms of non technological transportation to move around the city. People who do not participate will be subject to paying money.

This day has caused new bike paths to be built, parks, sport centers to grow more popular, and decreases the air pollution of Colombia. Another country taking part in the no car festivities is Germany. In Vauban you will experience a ""car free"" community. This town has stores built within walking distance, and offers public transport to travel around the town. ""I`m much happier this way"" said a german mother of 2. She walks the town and speaks of the noises she hears such as the ""swish of bicycles"" and ""chatter of children"". The limitation of the cars has brightened the communtiy as a whole and allowed for it`s residents to be more happy and healthy as they walk or bike most places. Also, studies show that happiness and good health are directly related so while fixing the negative effects of car use you are also stopping the vicious cycle of obesity .

Over all, the world would be a much better place without a high usage of cars. These new ideas and innovations are testing the ideals of a car free society and frankly, they are getting positive results.  Without cars, the world would be a much cleaner, healthier and happier place for all.",0
"Today, it is not often we see somone walking or taking the bus as transportation.  Cars are the more preferred option of getting from point A to point B in a quick an easy way.  It is hard to even think about a world where car usage is limited, but there are many advantages of it and several efforts being made to accomplish this.

To begin, there has been a slow decrease of miles driven, driving by young people, and people obtaining a driver's license in the United States. President Obama has made it a goal to curb the country's greenhouse gas emissions, but how is this to be accomplished?  As studies show, America might have already had its peak in driving.  People are finding alternatives to the car such as public transportation, walking, bicycling, or carpooling.  As for limiting the pollution, many sociologists believe if this decrease persists, it will benefit carbon emissions and the environment.  Mimi Sheller, a sociology progessor at Drrexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center, said: ""different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift.""  Car companies have even began to worry and proposing ideas if this is to be accomplished and personal vehicle ownership is unnecessary.  ""Pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety,"" said Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company.  He proposed partnering with telecommunications industry to create cities where this ideal would be a reality.

Moreover, there are several other reasons why limiting car usage is advantageous.

Recently in Paris, there has been near-record pollution and in response, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air.  Congestion was down 60 percent but delivery companies complained of lost revenue.  If Paris did happen to continue this ban, pollution would have decreased even more.  Also, in Bogota, Columbia, there is a day each year dedicated to fray from car use with only buses and taxis permitted to drive.  People hiked, biked, skated, or took public transportation which was the cause of the absense of traffic jams.  The goal of this day is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog.  ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza.  Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay said, ""these people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders.""  This will hopefully spread into other countries, occur on more occasions throughout the year, and lead the way to ridding the world of pollution.

Furthermore, a suburb in Germany has taken a more extreme approach to the car-free situation.  70 percent of the residents of Vauban, Germany have given up there cars.  This is a growing trend in Europe and the United States and has become a movement known as ""smart planning.""  larger cities full of families are to blame for the impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emmisions from tailpipes, says experts.  ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.""  This experiment is very advanced and proves that living without cars is possible and has many advantages.  ""When I had a car I was always tense.  I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, resident of Vauban.  Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America.

To conclude, I believe there are many advantages of limiting car usage.  Pollution would decrease and traffic jams would stop.  Although many efforts are being made such as the ban in Paris and Car-Free day in Bogota, Columbia, people seem to be leaning more towards other means of transportation other than the car.  Both of these as well as the growing cities that forbid cars I think will lead the way into a world where personal vehicles are impractical and unwanted and pollution from cars is a thing in the past.",0
"Their are so many advantages of limiting car usage, for example having no car might even make someone happy, Heidrun Walter says ""When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Also driving cars can cause a lot of pollution, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of the green house gas emissions in Europe. France had intense smog because of vehicles, it went 60 percent down after five days of no vehicle use.

Another benefit of no vehicle usage is instead of driving a car, you can go hiking, biking, skating , or take buses to your destination. ""It's a good way to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two seat bicycle with his wife. The day without cars has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, which is the most of any other Latin American city. Parks and sports centers bloomed throughout the city on the day without cars in Bogota.

Also, in the United States Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses. Instead of driving vehicles to work, one can carpool with a workmate. New York has a new bike sharing program anits skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect new priorities, swell as carsharing programs across the nation. Driving by young people decreased 23 percent as of 2001 to 2009.

Even though driving a car might get you to your destination quicker, it is better to go on a train, bike, skate, bus, taxi, carpool, or even walk because when you use a car too much you pollute the Earth. Biking, skating, and walking can also be fun sometimes, so stop driving a car and do something more alternative and less air pollution, save the Earth.",0
"I have just read ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" and many people are convinced that the Face, found near Cydonia, is just a natural landform. However, there are also many people who believe this Face to be of extra-terresrial activity. However, NASA has gave us more facts that prove the Face to be a mountain-like landform rather than an extra-terrestrial phenomenon.

First of all, many photos taken by NASA themselves show no evidence of aliens, but natural landmasses. On April 5, 1998, NASA sent the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) over Cydonia. MIchael Malin and his team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Once that happened, it was revealed to the public that the Face was just a landform. This proves that the mass was indeed a landmass. Also, these pictures were taken after the original one(the one that got everyone speculatng about the origin of the landmass), which means that the new pictures are much clearer and thus more believable han the original.

Secondly, many of the theories around the Face of Mars being a definite sign of aliens, are all conspiracy theories. The fifth paragraph states,"" Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" This quote from the article proves that there are many people who make up theories that have no credibility or legs to stand on. Also, many of these claims hold no cocrete evidence but are rather based on speculation.

Finally, NASA deployed the MGS yet again on April 8, 2001- a cloudless day in Cydonia. Paragraph ten explains,"" We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maxium resolution."" Also, paragraph twelve states,"" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa-landforms common around the American West."" These quotes prove that the picture was the best resolution it be, and the Face was still depicted as a landmass. Also, they compare these landforms to landforms commonly found in the American West. This concludes that the Face is not of any extra-terrestrial activity, but just a misunderstanding made by conspiracy theorist.

In conclusion, based on the evidence from the article, the Face is in fact a landform of Mars. This states that there is no extra-terrestial life in our universe( as of right now). This article teaches people that you should not listen to conspiracy theories, but facts that have evidence to support it.",0
"To the senator of the state of Florida you have asked us to write a letter explaining why we believe in keeping the Electoral College and the answer to that is no we should not how many votes have gone to waste because of this unfair system? and wasn't the United States a democratic country? we as citizens deserve to atleast pick who runs our country, By having this system you are not giving us the right to vote if you think about it, like Bob Dole once said ""Abolish the Electoral College!"".

I believe, that this way of running presidential elections should be thought about more. You do realize people stand HOURS not a couple minutes or 20 minutes hours waiting and thinking that they are going to actually pick the president they believe this country needs when in reality you are actually picking electors that may or may not help you elect the president that you picked. ""What is the Electoral College"" By the Office of the Federal Register explains in detail much more about the electoral college and like he said ""You help choose your state's electors when you vote for president because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."" We as citizen should have the right to pick our leader the one that will help us overcome our problems not some candidates.

For instance, Let's take the 2000 Gallup poll also called the ""Biggest election crisis in a century"" by  Bradford Plumer in his story ""The indenfensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defense of the system are wrong"" Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency all together and we found that out thanks to the quirks of the electoral college. Do you imagine how many presidents that must have happened to? it is like when you are first place in a race your close to the finish line, you can feel your legs givng up on you but you don't stop you keep going because you know your gonna win after all you are the first one, you're so close your about to step on the line when boom! the person that was behind you caught up and well.. you lost. Can you imagine how many votes have just gone to waste and how many hours in peoples days.

However, Some of our best presidents have gotten picked by the Electoral College there is no doubt in that. But it still does not change the fact that its an unfair system, the story by Richard A. Posner ""In defense of the electoral college:Five reasons to keep our despised the method of choosing the President"" explains that ""As we saw in 2012 elections.. Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign-- to really listen to the competing candidates--knowing that they are going to decide the election."" What he is saying is thta basically some states do not even have billboards! how are we suppose to feel like citizens when you don't give us atleast a poster to know who is running for president? The big states get the most candidates ofcourse so basically, one states could decide who wins. The system has UNFAIR written all over it and we are all just waiting for you to see it.

In the end, It is the congress decision, But we do hope you look at these letters and realize how this is taking our rights away, how many votes have not even counted, and how selfish the whole system is. I do hope you take in my letter into consideration and decide the best decision for us. But please do remember that Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, The U.S Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO said "" Abolish the Electoral College!"".",0
"My position about technology is this brings many effect positive for us huminity life. I take this opinion for the chaning on our life and the support positive in the knowledge.

First reason, for saying the the tecnology have good effects on the human's life is it helps to do many activity fast and easy. For example, many years ago we had to go the store and we watched the stuffed we need. now with the new technology, we do not need to move. we can bay only.

Second reason, tecnology gives support to the knowledge with the creation of new tools and more precision.

For example, before we used the telescopes for treated to understand the universo, now the technology us helps with the creation of new satellite .

Thrid reason, that support the tnechnology have good effects in our economy. For example on market every people want to down the price of production, the new technology helps on this.

In conclution, technology shows to good change on human's life,

in the economy, in the konwlege and many areas technology helps.",0

Dear Generic_Name

I write to teacher Generic_Name today with the benefit of work in group. The work in group is more better then work alone, in the beneficial is the student work in group is have more opportunity of learn more with other students in the class, they can work more better and understand more quickly the theme in the class and have more collaboration, learn to respect other students. They in the group can say new ideas for the team.

I think in the personal the work in group is more productivity in the student because have a good communication with the students and teacher, they have more positive attitude in the ideas and participation.

For example, students in the group work more and learn more quickly because in group have a higher quality of ideas, and students can change ideas together about the theme in the class and have a better determination in the job of the class.

Second, work in group have a big benefit in the class because students understand problems more quickly, and they have solution in theme complicated with ideas and dedication in class.

Third, students have collaboration with other students have a good relation and learn to respect others person for religion or ideas. They have more communication in the class and have more better grade in the school.

However, work alone not have good result because almost all the student have fear to say ideas for the critic of other students in the class, and they have slow work in the class for complication of the theme.

The preference is work with a group have more benefit in the student and teacher to learn and teach other students in the school have more communication, better work and good relation in the school.

sincerely

"There are a lot of poeple these days that having a bad attiude during a difficult time. Here are some ways to try to have a good attiude during these times.

Getting a bad grade on a test or quiz. Their are kids in middle and high school who study and at times get bad grades. These kids have trouble knowing that they failed their test or quiz. One way to provent this from happen is by having a good mindset. They can deepdown be mad, but if they put tell themselfs that ""i'll try harder next time"" they could do better on the retake or on the next quiz or test. Even when some kids that study a lot and fail some of they overreact during it.

Overreacting is another promble kids have. Some kids overreact by saying ""if i fail this i wont get a job"". Other times kids thing negativly about themselfs and they bring themselfs down. They could be telling theemselfs "" i'm going to fail"" or anything else instand of that they sould try telling them say ""i'm going to try to do my best. They dont know intill they try to do their best.

Having a good mindset can help. Havin a good mindset meaning to think positivly and to know that not having passed their test or anyting in life. That everyone had to start from one place and build on. Other times kids should learn from their mistakes. They might have or might have not fail and they shouldn't put it on themselfs because they could fail if not.

These are ways to provent kids from having a bad attitude to having a good attitude during their difficult time. They should try to be more calm and the should try to not overreact at much. They should also try to have a good mindset during it.",0
"Did you know that when people are giving you advise someone else told that person the same thing! This is why some people probably don't have advise for you when you ask for some. But when people ask for advise they will most likely ask their family members, people who inspire them, and their current or old teachers.

When a person is going to ask for advise the first people they will probably ask is their family members. The first people in the family that would most likely ask is their parents. The reason for this is because they have been living with them most or their life or even their whole life. The next people in their family that they would ask would probably be their grandparents. Everyone I feel like thinks their grandparents are old and wise and know every thing but they I got admit they do have some good advise. The last person in the family someone would ask would be their brothers or sisters. You have been living with them most if not part of your life, and you wanted to move you could ask them for places they have been to that they liked or the best moving company. People ask what if you don't have any family members to look up to well who is been your inspiration in life.

Other people that you can ask or look up to for good advise is the people who inspire you. Say you don't a person who inspires you. Well you always have your parents or other family members. Most of time people who inspire you, you can most likely never see once in your life in person, so what do you do. You can go on the internet and search famous quotes that they said, or you can watch some television shows or YouTube videos of them talking inspirational. A person who can even inspire you could even be your friends. You have been with your friends your whole life so you always ask for good advise because they care for you. Well what if you don't want to ask someone who inspires you, well almost everyone went to school growing up so you always have your teachers.

While growing up almost everyone went to school and while you their everyone had teachers to teach you life skills. Most teachers you have had posters all over the walls with good quotes or great advise. You can always look at these posters and use them in your everyday life. A teachers job is to teach you life skills that you can use as a adult. So when a teacher give you advise you always use that advise any day of your life. Even after school is over you can still go back and ask them. The reason being is that they care for you, even if you were a bad student they will still help you. In the long run if you need help from a teacher you can always just stay after school and ask, go back if you have already left the school, or even look at those inspirational posters.

In conclusion their are lot of different people that you could get advise from. You can get advise from your family, people who inspire you, and your old or current teachers. Next time if I'm looking for good advise I would defiantly see one of these people.",0
"Studying Venus is worthy this shows in many way. Venus is known was the 'Evening Star"" and that's why we get light in the night sky. Venus is the second planet from the sun. Itis very challenging place to examine the earth more closely. Even tho Venus is a very challenging planet for humans to study they are proximity to us.

Venus has a wonderful value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet by itself, but also because the human curiosity will lead us tho more equal intimidating endeavors. They have meet very edges of imagination and innovation. The NASA are workig on other new ways to study Venus and to find more information about Venus. They have found out more about through out the time Venus has the hottest surfce temperature of any planet in this solar system. Astronomers are amazed by Venus because it is may well known.

Venus can be our nearest option for a planetary visit. We should all be very thankful for the people who study the planets. There are many more facts about Venus that humans know because of the people who study planets and Venus is the most important one. The Challenge of Exploring Veunus is worth the study that humans do.",0
"Have you ever struggled and needed help? What did you do to fix your problem? Asking your friends is a good option but a lot of times it's not good enough to just ask one person. When seeking out for advice, it is beneficial to talk to more than one person because it eliminates or decreases bias, you get multiple opinions from different perspectives, and you can find the most effective option to fit your own needs.

Many people have their own ways to solve certain problems and therefore have their own opinions on how to solve the task at hand. When you ask more than one person for advice, you can see what has worked for certain people and apply the different strategies to your own problem. Everyone needs some advice including players in the National Hockey League or in any other professional sport. Athletes always get advice from many coaches and each coach has their own style. Athletes then use the advice to see what is most beneficial. Asking for more than one person for advice won't guarantee that your problem will be solved, but the probability of success if substantially higher because you have other people's experiences to get you closer to your solution.

On my hockey team I am currently assistant captain and sometime my teammates come to me for help. For example, one of my teammates asks me what he needs to do when he below the goal line. I always give him my opinion, but i always suggest that he also asks for another opinion. Because we are not the same, my strategies won't necessarily work for him. When we start playing our games, he can try out the different strategies and see what is most effective. Now he is able to adjust and use the most effective solution to get his way out of the problem

Lastly, Asking multiple people is great because you can find the most effective option. I applied to three private schools and you had to write an essay for all three schools. When I was down at Texas, I was proof-reading one of my essays and was getting ready to turn it in. My mom and I were already proofreading but we chose to get multiple opinions on my essay. We ended up getting my aunt and my older cousin to help produce the best final copy of my essay. We were all collaborating and talking to make sure we all agreed on the errors and the best way to fix each problem. Even though I had my own ways of fixing it, it was not the most clear and concise way. The final product ended up very good and I ended up getting in to all three of the schools. This showed that getting multiple opinions on a certain task can lead to the best product or solution.

Getting multiple opinions is helpful because it eliminates or decreases bias leading to a overall better product or solution. Even professionals such as book authors need people to constantly check over their work and to give them feed back on their stories. Everyone needs help here or there along their lives, but all you have to do is ask. Getting multiple opinions will help eliminate or decrease bias, you get multiple opinions from different perspectives, and you can find the best most effective option.",0
"If you have ever been in a tough situation you would know getting help is one of the hardest things to do. Many people are scared or afraid to ask for help because they feel that they might be judged or picked on by others. Sometimes people ask for multiple opinions on their problem. The reason why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is because it helps you get the best possible answer, it gives you different points of view on the matter, and lastly there are people with more knowledge on the situation than others.

By asking for multiple opinions on a matter it can benefit you because it helps you make the best possible choice you can. The way I believe it benefits you to ask for multiple opinions is for example, if you are asking someone the best way to become better at football, the first person you ask might say go to the weight room three times a week, then the second person you ask might say to eat more healthy food and be a consistent runner, and lastly the third person says to go out on the football field and practice your throwing and catching two times a week. So with all the information you just received you can use it and make the best possible solution by working out three times a week, working on your throwing and catching two times a week and eating healthy and being a consistent runner.

The second way that I believe asking for multiple opinions can help you make the better choice is because you get different points of view on the matter. For example if you ask your friend ""whats the best way to study for a test,"" your first friend may say to study before the test to get all the information in your head right before your about to take it, your second friend may say that he doesnt know the best way to study for a test, your third friend may say to pay attention in class and do every single homework. The way this benefits you is because now that you got three different opinions on your matter you can pick which one that you would like to do.

The third and final way that I believe asking for multiple opinions can help you best make the better choice is because people have more knowledge on different situations than others. For example if you ask your friend whats the best barbershop to go to in Virginia your first friend might have no clue but your second friend that you ask might give you a location to go to because he has more knowledge on the topic then your first friend. Different people have different knowledge on different topics so that way your friends might not always know the solution to your question but others may.

In conclusion if you ask for multiple opinions then you should have the best possible solution for your problem. There are many reasons to ask for multiple opinions when you need help. The reason why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is because it helps you get the best possible answer, it gives you different points of view on the matter, and lastly there are people with more knowledge on the situation than others.",0
"Studying Venus would be a worhty pursuit despite the dangers because it would provide great information and it is very unique. Venus is like no other planet; but if it is so dangerous, why do scientists want to find out more about it? Astronomers are interested in Venus because there is a possibility that Venus was the most Earth-like planet in the solar system years ago.

To start off, even though Venus is very dangerous, exploring it would provide a lot of intreging information. With an atmosphere of nearly 97 percent carbon dioxide and 800 degrees Fahrenheit, scientists are already trying to find out more, but they are not sure how, without having to be on the rocky yet toxic surface. ""Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape""(5). If NASA can put the blimp tactic in motion, scientists can start getting a much more magnified look at the mysterious planet. Even if the danger is extremely high, one scientist one of these days eventually is going to try to explore and find out more amazing facts and imformation about Venus. So why wait now?

In addition, exploring Venus would be worth it because of it's uniqueness. If any group of scientists were to go on a safe trip to observe the Evening Star it will probably be the most memorable day of their lives. Because there is nothing like Venus.

""Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us""(2). This shows that scientits have already attempted to learn more about the mystery planet, but haven't been very succesful. These scientists need to take flight. The only way that they will be able to get as close as possible and get the most accurate and approximate information is by being inside an aircraft hovering above the gasous planet. If the practices are completely correctly and safely and all of the precautions are met, there shouldn't be a problem with trained professionals to take on the unique ball of gas.

In conclusion, Venus is a mysterious planet that needs some research to figure out all of the different functions it has. And it's purpose for our world and solar system, because if it didn't have a purpose, it would't be in our galaxy. Studying Venus is definetly worth the risk because there is so much information that scientists could use to their advantage and to truly see how unique this planet really is.",0
"Everyone makes millions of choices in his or her lifetime. While making these choices, it is not uncommon for one to ask others for advice. Often, one will consult multiple people. It is always an excellent idea to receive multiple opinions when one is making an important choice or decision because this gives one an open mind to all methods and ideas, lets one know what the most reliable choices are based on how many have suggested them, and all while still allowing the decision-maker to choose the best option for himself.

Consulting multiple people for ideas and suggestions allows one to have an open mind when considering every different method. This can be evidenced by my own experience. One time, I had to decide what to get with money I had received for my birthday. I knew I wanted clothes, but I could not decide which kind. I believed it would always be practical to buy uniforms for school. However, my friends suggested I purchased clothing such as merchandise, sportswear, accessories, even things that were not clothes! All of these suggestions baffled me at first, but then i realized they were actually fantastic ideas! Ultimately, I decided to compare every suggestion I received and decide what to spend my money on based off of that. I realized that buying uniforms would be a bit of a waste and that I already had plenty, whereas there was a bit of a dearth when it came to clothes I actually enjoyed wearing. Without my friends, I never would have realized that! Ultimately, I ended up purchasing whatever clothes made me happy, such as those I found aesthetically pleasing and those that reminded me of things I enjoy. Despite thinking it was impractical at first, I am still very pleased with my choice and I never would have made it without the consultation I got from others.

Taking advice from others also shows which method of action holds the best results. For example, a few years ago, I needed to decide which middle school to attend. All of my friends were going to different schools, so i did not know what to do. I decided to look into the schools themselves rather than which ones my friends were attending. I looked for a school that met my personal standards and one that adults I know can tell me about. A lot of people told me that Generic_School was in my best interest and most closely fit the criteria I was looking for. They told me about the positives and negatives of it and compared it to other schools. It took me a while to make the decision, but I am glad I did. No school is perfect but I believe that this one was the best for me. This proves that recommendations are always good things to take into consideration when making an important decision.

Receiving multiple opinions is also wise because it gives insight on other people's perspectives while still allowing the decision-maker to make the choice that works best for him or her. An example of this is one that comes from my own experience. When deciding what to do this summer, I was given three options. I had to decide between traveling to West Virginia, traveling to Colorado, or staying here in Virginia and attending the Generic_School. My sister reminded me that going to West Virginia has not been pleasant for the two of us in the because never had anything to do. Then, my mom reminded me that going to Colorado means I will have to stay with my grandmother, who may try to convince me to call my father. Lastly, one of my friends suggested I attend Generic_School because I will have friends going there and I will be given the chance to improve my art. In the end, I decided I would like to travel to Colorado. Even with the possible downside, Colorado is my favorite place and I would be happy to return again, as I have not been there in years. The guidance from others helped me make my decision, but it was still up to me, and I am happy I was given the option to travel where I would like.

In conclusion, getting multiple opinions on decisions before making them is never a bad idea. The things I believe, such as that multiple opinions provide open-mindedness, multiple similar reccomendations can be reliable, and that listening to suggestions does not mean one needs to follow them, have made me believe that it is always practical to take other ideas into consideration and decide which option works best in whatever situation one is in.",0
"Today schools offer many tools or ways to complete your diary learning process. one of these tool is called ""school at home"" or ""distance learning"". Basicaly students can complete all their schoolworks and learning process at home through different methods like, in this case, the students attend classes form home by way of online or video cinferencing, but is it really good for the students?. Probably not.

It is know that students learn how to be sociable at school, and also they learn how to act at to many different social events or situations in the daily life. For example, we have a group of students, they are all the day working in a classroom with other students and friends that they knew at school; and we have a group of students that take ""school at home "", they do their school work in their houses and they just can socialice with they family at home. How can you learn how to be sociable without socialice with new people? different than your family ?. The answer is: you can't. Talk with new people improve you confidence and helps you to make new friends, and as students or young people, we do not used to try to talk with new people, because we are afraid, we don't have self-confidence, etc. and school force us to be social with our partners.

Moreover, some people claim that school is not a good way to improve your social abilities, but that people passed and important point and is that the school is the best way to improve your social abilities. For example, you (as a student) are working from monday to friday at least six hours per day with other students and teachers in different classrooms, the students aren't going to be the same in each classroom. All these factors made you get used to different personalities or behaviors of your teachers, friends, and classmates. School have to many different people with different behaviors that can help you to understand the way that people act and how to be their friend.

In addition, school teaches you how is going to be your life when you grow up and trains you for that. There are to many similarities between school and a job, for example: the schedule that makes you get use to the early woke ups, the homeworks that make you understand how long can be a job journey, and the teachers and students that represents your boss ans partners at work. All these examples of how school trains us for our future. Without all the training that the schools gave us, it would be a problem to get use to or daily life when we grow up.

All these reasons show us that school will benefit students more than ""school at home"" or ""distance learning"", because it teach us how to be sociable, it develops or social abilities, and it is a necessary part of our training for our adult life. In conclusion, school trains us as people, it teach us how to socialice and work.",0
"Did you know that over eighty percent of the population asks more than one person when they tend to ask questions? I believe that it is helpful to seek more then one person because one many people could have experienced it, two other people may have a different answer, and three I believe that it is a good idea to ask more than one person because they might just be wrong or right or they might have no clue what your talking about at all.

My reasons for my statements up above are one because that person may have experienced it and may just know what you are talking about. My reasons to support this are one if you simply ask more than one person you may get a better answer because they may or may not know what you are talking about, two if they experienced it they may not a lot about the topic and how they can help you, and my last statement about this is that if they experienced it rather than not at all you could always do research about it more and maybe asking more people could increase your social skills more. In conclusion to this paragraph I believe that you should always ask more than one person because they might just have a good feeling that they know what your talking about.

However, I also believe that as well as what I just said I think that you may get a better answer to support this is if you simply ask one person they might not even know at all, two you could always ask more and get a better answer and sum it up more to answer it, and finally, my last reason to support it is that one person you decided to ask might not even be right at all. In conclusion I believe that you should ask everyone because that one person might not be right plus you never know you may get a good answer.

My last reason to support this is that is you ask more than one person you could have a high chance of increasing you social skills by a lot, two if asking more people increases the chances of your answer actually being right, and finally it is always good t ask more than one person because they could have just honestly tell you a lot about it if it is something they know a lot about.

In conclusion,

I believe that it is never a bad idea to ask more than one person a question or and idea.

I believe the main idea or thesis of my topic is that it is a good idea to ask more than one person a opinion or an idea because they could just simply know more about it or they could just give a more honest opinion about it.

The lesson you can learn from this is that you should always ask more than one person about a question or just a simple opinion because they could honestly just know more depending on what your talking bout while if you just ask one person it can be just a twenty percent chance either they know it or not. You should listen to me about what I have to say because why would you risk the chance of just asking one person about a question they might not even know about at all? Or why even waste your time on something when you do not even know if they lied about it even being true or not or even knowing about it.

If you do not listen to me and just ask one person then good luck actually looking for the answer you want with only a twenty percent of someone even knowing what you are talking about or them not even giving you what you want or the correct answer. In conclusion, you should just really ask more than one person to get what you are really looking for and that might just improve some skills along with social skills.",0
"Dear State Senator, I have realized that there has been debate lately about if we should abolish the Electoral College or not. Reading about this, you could swing either way and have a valid point, but I think my way has more valid points and makes more sense as a whole picture. The key here is the bigger picture because if you look at a small flaw of something for long enough it eventually takes up the whole picture in your mind. You may have your opions about it and I have mine but I would like to share mine with you so you can see why the Electoral College is still important and should still be used.

When our founding fathers sat down and decided to right up our federal government system, they argued emensly on voting and how it should go about. when they finished bickering and developed this system, they made sure everything had a checks and balances type of layout. With the Electoral College, "" you vote for the electors and they vote for president and vice president, and then congress counts the electorsial votes"". This idea is more beneficial then just having a majority vote for obvious reasons. With the electorsal votes and populous votes it makes it harder to choose a president just by a single vote advantage.

Now I know your probably yelling at this letter saying the disaster factor is the main problem with the electorsial college but let me finish. there have only been two times that this has happened. ""It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes then bush yet fewer electorsal votes, but that was the first time since 1888"". If this has only happened twice then I think it is something that is fixable, but should not be the deciding factor that takes away the whole Electoral College system. The main reason we have this system is so there is a certainty of outcome and not just one score that is judged.

The way this is set up is so that ""no region has enough electorsal votes to elect a president"". This is a great thing because imagine if it was just majority vote the most populated states could just vote who they wanted to be president and it would be done. No other states would be able to compete and on top of that the candidates for president would only have to campaign in the populated states where they know they are already liked. The Electoral College is there so things aren't done in a jiffy. With this system the candidates actually have to work on trying to gain supporters in states where they may not be liked in. It also makes the American people think about all the options and decide on a bigger scale that requires more then just ""one vote"" to win an election.

Can you see why we need this Electoral College to stay and not just be abolished over like it is some plastic bottle on the highway that gets avoided and never gets picked up. We need people to stay actively involved in voting and I personally think the Electoral College does the best job with this. If the founding fathers spent months upon months just argueing about this single topic, I do not think they would just blow it off last second and come up with some giberish. If this system has worked this well this long then I think they must of done something right. Please consider my opinion state senator. ""Voters in presidental elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election"".",0
"I feel like the use of this technology being able to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not needed in anyway.

I feel this way because in the artical it stated that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" (Dr. Huang). That could be useful, the computer notices that the students are bored and some confused, and then it changes to now the students that were bored and confused, now are amused and understand it much better. But the normal teacher that we have already can do that to.

As an example a teacher notice when students are bored, and then swich it up a little so keep things somewhat fresh, and when students get confused, the teacher will do the exact same things, swich some of the lesson up and explain it more. Just like the computer.

As somewhat of a side note, it also feels more natural to be taught by a human. Because its someone who thinks the way you do, understandes you better because they have been through everthing school wise as you. If I had a choise to be taught by a computer or a teacher, I would pick the teacher because a computer might know everything there is to know, but it would make me feel in a way, safer, because I would be talking to a human, something everyone is used to doing.

Overall, I state that it is not valuable because the teacher can almost do the exact same thing as the computer. Yes, teachers maybe not be able to tell that you are 65% bored and 35% confused, but do we really need a computer to tell us this information, because I feel like it would be a waste of money and time, if its something humans can already do and have been doing much longer than any computer has, humans are not as exact as a computer, but we can help out a student, and recognize that the student is confused or bored, and much more. We can help the student, just like a computer.",0
"Some schools use cell phones in the classroom for educational purpose. People think it is a good idea for students to have phones for educational purpose. I believe students should not have phones in classrooms because students could easily get distracted, they will not have the chance to learn better, and having a phone should be a privilege.

First reason why I believe we should not have cell phones for educational purpose is ,students will get distracted. They will start using their phones for other purposes that are not educational or what their teacher has recommended. Students will start texting instead of doing their assigned work the teacher gave them. Students will start thinking it is okay for them to take out their phones when it is time for learning.

Second reason i believe it is wrong for students to have cell phones in classroom. Students will not have the chance to learn how it use to be. Students that actually take notes have a better chance to memorize what they learned and doing better in tests. When teachers do hands on work during class students can learn and teach their peers.

Last reason why i believe students should not have phones during class is ,phones are a privileged to have. Teachers should not allow phones during class time because students will not know when is the right time to have phones during class. Even if they put strict rules students will find a away to go around those rules.

In conclusion, this is why I believe some schools should not allow phones in classrooms. Students will get distracted, they will not get the chance to learn more, and having phones is a privilege. I believe schools should not allow students to use their phones during class.        ",0
"People ask for advice for any reason, especially when they can't decide. So why ask for multiple opinions? If I were to ask for advice I would go to multiple people and ask for their opinions. The reason why people ask for advice is to help come up with better inspiration or better ideas. Why they ask multiple people is to get better advice and different opinions on what they should do so they don't have to pick one certain idea.

Why should asking multiple people help with your decision? When you ask yourself for advice your brain may not be as open as other people. When I say that it means that all people think differently, for example many people have different beliefs and different ideas. Sometimes when asking different people you can come up with better advice or sometimes it can lead you to better advice. When you have multiple opinions it all could connect and you have your then you have really powerful and really good advice or it could just lead you to different places. But when you ask different people you realize the differences and different opinions that could help with your decision or take away from your decision. Certain people make good decisions and bad decisions but it's all up to that person to make one whether it is good or bad. If multiple people have enough evidence to support their advice, then that person would most likely choose their advice or add on to it.

What could help someone make a better choice? When someone makes a choice it could be good or bad depending on what they tell themselves or what other people tell them. When people ask for advice it would be really good to have evidence to support you advice. Asking multiple people would also make an impact because they all have different ideas and opinions on different things. But, when you ask certain people there could be a difference. For example, you could ask a really good friend for advice and then ask enemies that's what would make the difference because a friend would try to help you with good advice but when you ask enemies they wouldn't most likely do that. Another reason why asking certain people, is that you could be hanging around people who don't make good decisions and ask them for advice that wouldn't help you in a good way but, asking people that make good decisions would most likely give you good advice.

What is good advice? A lot of people ask for advice whether it's a friend, a relative, or a celebrity. When asking someone you know for advice doesn't mean it's good advice even though you have seen them on TV, you see them everyday,or you have seen them all your life. Good advice is when it benefits you in some way emotionally or physically. When someone gives you good advice it should be meaningful to you but, that doesn't always happen. When asking multiple people it sometimes builds up to make this really good piece of advice that could help you and other people in the world. People ask for advice for any reason and when they ask multiple people it helps them get different opinions of what to do and what not to do. When people do get good advice they seem to be a better person and understand how to give others really good advice.

Having good advice is really helpful from multiple people even though they aren't all the same. That's why people ask for advice is to help come up with better inspiration or better ideas. Also because they ask multiple people is to get better advice and different opinions on what they should do so they don't have to pick one certain idea that doesn't help them as much as getting other good advice ad using them all. So what's the purpose of asking multiple people? It's just to help support and give better advice.",0
"Dear Senator, We the people, of the United States of America..... These are the first words written upon the Declaration of Independence. This is our very earliest document showing our democratic tendencies, and how we act as one. It also shows how we make decisions among ourselves as a people, as opposed to having other make decisions for us. This leads me to what I wish to discuss with you. Others do not vote for us. We vote for ourselves. We decide who leads us, who will help us get to a better place, who will decide what to do about the national debt, who will pass laws concerning immigrants and the minimum wage. We do. Not you, not the House of representatives, and most certainly not the Electoral College. Which is why there should be no Electoral College.

The Electoral College is a group of people whom elect the president2. How many for each candidate there are is decided by us, the voters. But heres the thing most voters think they're voting for the president. They dont even know what they're voting for! And even if some do, its easy to get confused and accidentally vote for the wrong candidate10. While one vote may not skew the entire election, a couple thousand can.

Many who support the Electoral College will say that voting by popular vote is a bad idea because of the possibility of a tie18. But in reality, it is just as easy to tie in the Electoral College. Its happened recently too, in 1888 and again in 200018.

This isn't the only thing thats broken about the Electoral College. The possibility that a president could win by popular vote, but lose the campaign due to the electoral vote is filthy. It is unfair to the people, and far from democratic. The Electoral College is an anachronism15. It reminds me of the Roman Republic really, and we are not romans, and this is not a republic. Or, at least, its not supposed to be.

Something else that is unfair to the people. Due to the Electoral College candidates only focus on large states, or swing states13. Voters in small states, such as Wyoming, will never see the candidates and may see only one or two camaign ads. They can't get to know the candidates and make an informed decision. And even in the regional states, democrats should always be trying to convert republicans to their side and vice versa. But because of the large swing states, this rarely happens.

The possibilty of corruption among the Electoral College, is also a present danger. I'm sure you remember form history class how party bosses took advantage of naive immigrants. I can imagine republican electors being paid off or threatened so that they vote democrat. Can you really trust the electors?

According to a poll in 2000, 60% of people want to activate a popular vote system. Popular soverignty worked well for awhile when it came to the topic of slavery, why won't it work for us now? And why would anyone want such an outdated system like the Electoral College in place? Think upon my words Mr. Senator. The Electoral College needs to end.",0
"Theres so many roads in the world but traffic still exists. Ever think about the amount of cars in your neighborhood?, dont you think thats probaly the reason why? In the Sources 1,2,3 , and 4 all imphasizes on how having a limit of car usage can be an great advantage to society. I believe that the limiting of car usage is an great advantage. This is true because Limiting care usage lowers pollution, Decreases traffic.

With that being said , Limiting car use lowers air pollution. I agree with this because the less cars driven leads to less burning fuel. According to the passage by Robert Duffer paragraph 10 states that ""After days of near-record pollution, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.""Due to the high population in Paris and numerous amount of the owning a vehicle causes massive car pollution. Having massive car pollution can be dangerous, this inherits sickness, stress and diseases. Refering to the source ""Car-free Day is spinning into a big hit in Bogata,Columbia"" Mayor Of Bogota (Antanas Mockus) stated that ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" As he rode a two seater bike with his wife. The Mayor in this content speaks the absolute truth. As you walk to your destination in the nice warm air you relive stress and diseases that were causing you to be sick before. Those are the reasons why i think limiting car usage lowers the pollution.

Additionally, Limitiing car usage decreases traffic. This is true because if there is 5 people going to the same place you are and all of you guys drive in that one car or bus that reduces the traffic. Micheal Sivak In Source 4 ( The end of car Culture) elaborates on that by saying ""What most intrgues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before downturn, I Think that means something more fundamental is going on.""What Mr. Sivak means by this is that everyone should only have a certain amount of car per household and person Which will also lower the traffic. Traffic in paris is very long but due to the car-free act traffic was reduces. from reading source 2 by Robert Duffer ,it states ""Congestion was down 60 % in the capital of france (Paris), after five days of intensifying smong."" Just in five days of no driving the air is already unpolluted imageded if you drived five days all day. Those are the reasons why i think that Limiting car usage is an advantage.

To Conclude,I believe that the limiting of car usage is an great advantage. This is true because Limiting care usage lowers pollution, Decreases traffic.",0
"The long list of benefits that comes from limited car usage are mostly based on where you live and how much you do your part. Laws and restrictions have been arriving across the entire world to see the effects of having little or no automobiles in the community. Other countries that have an intense cloud of smog need to ban car use in the millions at a time to help settle down the atmosphere there.

Life without cars today can be very well described in Elisabeth Rosenthal's article In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars. In her article she describes how the community is shaped and condensed in order to make travelling to necessary places easy through walking or bike riding distance. This is the kind of turn around that the world needs as well. With the amount of pollution happening, this is a good experiment that will hopefully spread all over the planet.

The amount of pollution affecting certain cities across the world is getting rather out of hand. In Robert buffer's article Paris bans driving due to smog , he talks about the intense pollution over France's capital, resulting in the partial ban of almost of the amount of cars on the road at once. Those who violated the ban's rules were fined, and thousands of cars were impounded as well due the the reaction of citizens when they received the fine. In paragraph 14 of the article, Duffer states that "" Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France , after five days of intensifying smog."" The ban clearly worked, showing that it was indeed the heavy number of vehicles on the road all at once.

Programs all across the world have gotten people in the millions to find other methods of travel that did not cause any pollution. Columbia is a huge example as shown in Andrew Selsky's article Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota. In the article, Selsky specifies about how millions of Columbians have taken alternative modes of transport, whether it be hiking, biking, or skating as opposed to general driving. Even on account of rain, the citizens found ways to get about without using their cars. This is making Bogota a more human and social place as well, as Selsky states, "" Parks and sports centers have also bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks."" This event is happening for the good of the people and of the planet, and it seems like everyone is okay with that.

With the way our world is rapidly changing with a new generation and new technology, we are going to have to adapt from our old habits. Young adults are not seeing the full necessity of buying a vehicle when they can get to where they need to go by other means that are less expensive and less harmful to the environment. The need for everyone to have a car is slowly going down. It may never completely go away, but it is reducing greatly.",0
"dear state senator, im writting this letter to you so you consider changing to election by popular vote for the prsident of the united states instead of electoral college. i belive like branford plumer, that the electoral college is very wrong not only because under the electoral college system, voters dont vote for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. but also because it is very unfair to voters, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. the electoral college is outdated, unfair, and irrational and its time for a change.

nevertheless the electoral colleges dispute over its outcome is possible, it also nrequires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, its winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes does induce the candidates, the electoral college also restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-appotionment of the senate decreed on the constition, and it avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast.

the electoral college method of selecting the president is and will turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. according to the gallup poll in 2000, 60 precent of voters would prefer a direct election the electoral college is losing the little defenders it has and due to the spurious arguments the electoral college should be abolished.",0
"Phones and Driving

Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. According to research cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at a four time greater risk of a crush. Despite of a danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands. Moreover, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.

Opponents whose work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to tragedy. Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.

Opponents say that hands-free set is safety because people can drive using two hands. However, hands-free devices don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe. Researches show that using headset can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distracts drivers from focusing on the road. Scientists had proven that people talking over the phone image person who they talking to and that doesn't interfere with driving. The problem is when a car swerves unexpectedly or pedestrian step into traffic, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time. So the problem isn't in holding the wheel and cell phone at the same time what may cause an accident because of lack man oeuvre, it is because of conversation and lack of reaction at the particularly time.

Opponents say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency. However, it is illusion of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in car. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable, and the trusty solution for the difficult situation is OnStar. OnStar is a service that in case of accident or an emergency will contact you. If you are not able to answer, they will contact police department, hospital and fire service giving them your exact GPS location. Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations while On Star is always prepare to help you in an accident.

Concluding, if people don't give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase. It is people responsibility to not incur their own and others people lives.",0
"Dear,

Senator

I think we should change the election by popular votes for the President of the United States. It's a more accurate process and who knows what people running for office has up there arm. The electoral college voting has a repeated tendancy to vote for the state of electors and that way they end up voting for the President. People prefer to vote for exactly who and what they choose to vote for and Electoral college isn't the way to go for it. What would happen when we run out of electoral votes just stick and choose a President? In what world is that fair and accurate?

Popular votes will actually help the voters voting and it might even be a faster process, whose to say, it could even be better. People aren't voting for President anymore which is the most important person in the senate, besides you the right hand man. The Citizen's voting are starting to vote for the state electors do to where they originate or live in. Citizens have not yet grasped the rules of voting and tend to vote unfairly and not for the real reasons we urgently need these people in house,senate, or office. In some states electors refused to even vote for their particular party's candidate  and choose to vote for who ever they wish to vote for which is a good thing. these electors prefer to vote for whoever will do a better job in office and that's what were scoring for with popular votes. What happens to votes when there's a run off, because there isn't enough votes to be held accountable for? Thats a question to think about , because there could be a lot of problems to be the cause of it.

To have a certain number of people vote for who they choose to be President is surprisingly unrealistic. Why choose the majority rule when you could have thousands of People praying for a change vote for a change in their their future for a better life. The ""winner-take-all"" system has to be the most challeging systems of them all but seems to work out after all. ""Electoral College is the best way!"" what happened to the People actually living off of the rules that the Electoral college Voters choose for the people all together? It's time to make a change, why not start now and see how the congress feels. The biggest Decision that should be made should be made fairly by the people, the citizens. In paragraph 13 it even states ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters."" why not make a change make a difference.

To whom ever it may concern, Big States are the main key. If we could get the big states to take part in the Popularity vote the smaller states will join in. Hoping for the best the Popularity Votes will soon rise and all the discrepencies won't be needed. If you understand where I'm coming from you'll think about what I'm saying if you care about the citizens your trying to help out.",0
"Dear State Senator,

The Electoral College is a significant way of selecting a new president or choosing for the president to have four more years as president. The Electoral College consist of 538 electors. Electing a president by Electoral College is not alwats good because of the possibilities of ways to make that president win. Such as, bribing, or false statements of change. The president should be a hardworking and well-deserving man who wants to make a change in the world. With that being said, the popular vote is the way we would like to keep as electing our president of the United States.

Additonally, the Electoral College is not generally smart in a way to elect the president of United States. Worded in source two The Indefensible Electoral College, ""The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse"". Electing Presidents is an important selection for the American people. Democrates and Republicans choose who the think deservers to be president and the popular vote process is the wise way to do it and the way we want to keep it.

Furthurmore, popular vote is going to bring in new, and great desicion making presidents in the near future. Stated in Source 3: In Defense of the Elctoral College, ""A dispute over the outcome of an Elctoral College vote is possible-it happened in 2000- but it's less likey than  dispute over the popular vote"" proves the popular vote is less comotional with less chaos.

Justifiably, both ways of electing president is wise and great but, popular vote is the better way. Has less drama, chaos, and comotion. It also makes choosing a president 10 times easier. Popular vote is the way we would like to keep as electing out president of the United States.",0
"We should keep the Electoral College for the voting of the United States. One good reason is they know for sure who is going to the president of the United States because of the way the Electoral College is. This voting process helps avoid a lot of bad things too. There are so many good reasons why we should keep this form of voting.

Avoiding RunOff Elections is one good reason why we should keep the Electoral College according to ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President."" It states that, ""The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes."" This is good because they keep one of the presidents that got the majority of the votes to win automatically,instead they have to do some math to see who the winner is."" In the first writing ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register. This writing says that ""Most states have a ""winnertakeall"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate."" This is basically saying that everyone gets to go the presidential election.

Some more key points are some more notes in the first and last writing. In the writing ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President."" and it states, ""The electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states by population lose by virtue of the malapportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution..."" This is saying that go by a different rule of voting because of the population being than other states. Another good point is in the first paragraph again and it says ""The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November."" This is good that you have a schedule for for the next voting this gives us enough time to vote, it also gives the time to see if the president is good or not.

There is some downsides to this little thing you have going on here though. That is in the second paragraph and it really gets my attention, ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" With this in mind it is telling us the people that we are not voting for the president at all that is what most people believe that they are doing so you are kind of lying to some of them.

To wrap things up I am telling you that your Electoral College system is great in most ways. You should try and change some of those things that are bad about it though. Not just the one I talked about but more that others talk about and doing this can you and all that work with ten times better than you were before.",0
"cars all around the world are a big part of many peoples daily use. they are used so much that it is starting to become a big problem in major cities like paris, beijing, and new york. now these cities and governments are trying to stop the use of cars before it is too late.

in europe, cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emisions. in the u. s, they are resposible for up to 50 percent in some big cities. if there were less cars on the road, the amount of greenhouse gass emisions would drasticaly change.

in paris, due to the amounts of polution in the air, all cars with even number plates were banned from driving on monday. the next day the same rules aplied to odd numer plates for a 22 euro fine. air polution was down 60 percent after 5 days of intensifying smog.

diesel fuels are blamed in france for causing so much polution. a tax policy there makes diesels more populat than gas cars. diesels make up 67 percent of all vehicles in france, while in western europe, 53 percent are diesel. paris usualy has more polution than other big cities in europe. at one point, paris had 147 micograms of particulate matter per cubic meter. brussels had 114 and londan had 79.9.

recently, there has been a shift in how amercans are usin g there automobiles. as each year passes, americans are buying less cars and driving less. the miles driven in america peaked in 2005 and steadily declined ever since. in april of 2013, the amount of miles driven by a person on average was equal to where it was in january 1995.

in bogota columbia, there acr car free day frequently. in the capital city of 7 million people, only busses and taxis were allowed. authorities from other counties came to bogota to see what i was like without cars and were hapy about it.",0
"Automobiles, people relay on them. without  cars alot of people are lost. they are too lazy to walk or ride a bike anywhere. But, cars arent that great they are actually causeing alot of damage. the pollution that is given off by cars is ridculous. most people dont relize the damage they are doing let alone the affect cars have on your life.

Frist off, cars are responible for 12 percent of greenhouse house emissions in europe. In some car-intensive areas in the  United states the greenhouse emissions are about 50 percent from cars! thats alot people are causeing without really knowing if we were to get the word out maybe we could change it and make the world cleaner.

Secondly, the united states environmental agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities. they want to make cities and towns more compact and close together. Because in the suburbs cars play such a huge role. these places arent very compact, so people cant just walk everywhere that would take all day. but on the upside walking everywhere is good excerise so while your getting rid of pollution, your also lossing the obesity rate in the united states.

then, in Paris they have banned cars due to smog. Anyone who drove would be fined 22 euros (31 dollars). congestion in the captial france was down almost 60 percent. after a little bit of time enough smog had cleared so they could rescind the ban.

after, in Bogota, Colombia they started a car free  day were everyone took buses, biked, hiked, walked or any means of transportaion except cars to get to work. this reduces smog in that area. all of this walking and so forth also helps people relive stress.  which wil drop the crime rates.

Lastly, in the untied states gas emissions are quite high. but, are believed to go down beacuase in  a recent study , fewer people each year are buying cars or getting liscence. they say if this pattern contuines and they think it will cars will stop coming around.

In conculsion,people relay on them, without  cars alot of people are lost. but, in due time all these things will change so it will all be okay. the smag will go away . and the earth will be clean.",0
"Automobiles have been used as the average use of transportation ever since the Was there any other reason to use anything other than a car after that, no not really but now there are. After so many decades there arrives three valid reasons to limit the average joes use of their motor vehicle. One, you can reduce the smog build up in your cities, two as well as smog greenhouse gases heavy up on areas in the Earths atmosphere but can be helped, three people use public transportation more as well as riding their bikes and walking. if you can limit your selves on car use, you can create a better tomorow.

First off, reducing smog in your area. smog is generated out of the tail pipes of motor vehicles and is bad for the environment and atmosphere. with limiting your daily car commute you can remove a good part from your area. when Paris had ordered that only plates that only odd number plates could drive on the roads on monday their large smog cloud of 147 micrograms of PM per cubic meter smog was greatly reduce and lifted the following day. so just one day of cutting the daily car commute in half a city as big as Paris was able to lift a smog.

moving along, the green house gases. Green house gases a like smog is a by product of driving your every day car to and fro work. green house gases are dangerous chemical gases that eat away at earths Ozone layer letting in UV rays that can be very harmful to you and the rest of the ecosystem. bogota recently had a car free day in which no one was allowed to drive motor vehicles except for buses and taxis. their goal was to promote alternative uses of transportation as well as lowering the amount of green house gases let into Earths atmosphere. doing something like what bogota can help cut down on all the harsh chemicals being let off into the atmosphere.

lastly, finding other sources of transportation other than every day car. finding another way of getting around is great for the community, it keeps you healthy and the earth healthy. Vauban germany is actually a car free city, it does not have roads on which you can drive upon but only a main street. everything that is needed in the town is no longer a car ride away but a bike ride away or a walk down the road resulting in a very community both people and ecosystem. as well as that is also saves people money not haveing to buy or a car for that matter. now think on how it would be like if your city did this and how much it would benefir from it.

In conclusion, having a car free day or banning about half the cars from driving on one day is not a bad thing but instead a good thing. once again you can reduce the smog, you ca even help keep green house gases out of the atmosphere, and for the last time find other healthier ways of getting around. so to ask the simple question why would you not limit your everyday car use.",0
"Dear principal,

If you don't like to leaving in a place were there is lots of people that litter then I think you would be able to tell some friends to do some community service is a very good idea because it helps keep your town or city clean. I think that we should start to do community service because a lot of people litter and it is really bad for our oceans and if we clean litter up we will keep oceans clean and it will be save for the fish.

"We run our elections by a process called Electoral College. This process consists of tje selction of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. The Electoral College consists or 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoal votes is required to elect the President.

There also is another process which is the election by popular vote for the president of the United States. We could change to popular vote but why would we change how we run the election if this is how we have been doing it for years. Also there are many other reasons why we should keep the Electoral College. Such as certainty of outcome, everyone's president, swing states, Big states,and also avoid run-off elections.

A dispute over the outcome of an Electoal Collge vote is possible but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning canidates share of the Electoal College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes, 538, is an even number, but it is highley unlikly. Also the Eletoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a priesident.

The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the politial balance that large states ( by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the constitution. The winner take all method of awarding electoal votes induces the canidates. Voters in toss up states are more likely to pay more attentionto the campaign to really listen to the competing canidates, knowing tjat they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters.

It can be argued that the prsident may turn off potential voters for a canidate who has no hope of carrying their state. I believe that we should not change our electorial process to popular vote and i think we should stick with the process we have now ; Elecoral College. I listed my resonas why but the main reason is that everyone is so used to the Electoral College process because we have been doing it for years so to change it, it might confuse everyone and actual make the elections even more difficult and it might end up messing up our election and cause an unfair vote.",0

Programs all over the world have been started to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. New York's new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

"When I was just learning how to play soccer I couldn't kick the ball correctly. Every single time I tried to my foot would slide under the ball causing the ball to go straight up in the air. Due to that disheartening fact I tended to get made fun of.....ALOT. I mean who can't kick a soccer ball correctly. So the best way I saw fit to help fix the problem at hand, was to ask the coach, my dad, and my best friend for advice. That would hopefully help me kick the ball better. So one thing I think is very important to help anybody learn is to ask more than one person for advice that in the future can help guide you into making better choices.

The number one person I confide in, if I ever have any kind of issue is my dad. He honestly is my rock. So as the situation arose. He was the first person I was going to talk to. So later that afternoon we walked outside and grabbed a ball. He watched me kick the ball about ten to twelve times. And, as I was doing this he never once laughed or judged me instead he gave me a helping hand and tried to help me work though the problem. Eventually he told me to stop and helped explain to me that my planter foot was not in the right place when I kicked the ball. So naturally, I asked him what the planter foot was and he patiently and carefully explained to me that the planter foot helped guide the ball to were it is supposed to go. That it was, the foot next to the soccer ball. Sadly try as I might his solution helped but didn't fix the problem as a whole. So as I walked back inside I started to plan who was the next best person that could help me solve the issue.

So the next stop in my quest to improve my kick, was my coach. As much as my father's advice had helped my kick the ball it still did not fix it. So as time when on I knew I was letting down my team by not being able to really kick the soccer ball. So the next time we had practice I emailed the coach and asked him to come fifteen minutes early to see if he could help with the pressing issue. Again he listened to my issue with interest and politely asked me to kick the ball so he could watch the way I kicked it to help detect the problem. So after about five minutes of watching me kick the ball he asked me if I could just do my run up to the ball but not kick it. So I did, the next thing he said surprised me, he told me that I was not running up to the ball correctly. Instead of coming to the ball from an angle to the kick the ball, I was standing right behind it and then trying to kick it. So just like the last time I started to use his method to see if that would help. In the end it made my kick stronger but it still was going straight up. So just as before, I sucked it up and started to think of the next person I could ask.

By then I could feel myself losing hope there was only one more person I felt like I could turn to who would not laugh at me because I could not kick a soccer ball. So the next day at school I went up to a girl named Generic_Name. She was my best friend and lucky for me she was one of the best girls on the soccer team. So as quietly as I could, so no one would here me, I asked her for help. Luckily she said that she was free after school and that we could meet up at her place to help work on the problem. So later that day I stood in her backyard with little to no hope. Her approach however was different from both the coach and my dad. She went though each step of kicking a soccer ball correctly and which situation calls for how much power, where you kick the ball, and what part of the foot you kick it with. So after a long explanation she asked me to show her the way I kick the ball. Of course even after all that the ball still went up in the air, I groaned. Then she stood up quietly and pointed to my foot and said, ""There.""

The place were I was gong wrong was which part of the foot I was kicking the ball with. I was trying to toe ball it the entire time. When in reality I needed to kick the ball with my laces. So I scurried off and went to look for another soccer ball. The next time I kicked the ball I made sure to kick it with my laces. I couldn't believe my eyes the ball went straight instead of up. I was super happy I ran over to her and gave her a huge hug. The next this thing Generic_Name said was, ""Don't thank just me, thank the people who got you to this point,"" of course as always she was right.

In the end I learned a valuable lesson for the problem, Which were advantages to asking more then one person for advice. Without the help from my dad, the coach, and of course Generic_Name, I wold have never been able to get there in the first place. After that I started to really understand the advantages of asking more than one person for advice. Without there advice I very might well have ended up quitting the sport that I now love. So without a doubt I think that asking more then one person will benefit you a lot more then asking just one person for advice to a problem. So the next time you feel like there is no one to turn to, or that no one else has faced the problem you are facing. Understand the possibilities that you may be giving away by not asking for advice from more then one person.",0
"Dear State Senator, The one word used throughout this whole article catastrophic, which is whats best used to describe the electoral college. The United States of America, born and based off of popular sovereignty, should be just that decided by the people. The electoral college has only been a hindrance since its arrival, confusing American Citizens left and right, becoming an issue to votersinterested future voters, and disallowing a fair chance of a voters vote to be of importance in their state, and to their country. The electoral college should be disbanded and reiterated by popular vote because of TWO main reasons:it does allow for a simple method of voting, and it does allow for every vote, and voice to be heard in the United States presidency election, tarnishing this country's right of democracy, causing outrages all over the country.

To initialize this onesided argument, lets begin with an important factor that the electoral college cannot be trusted on achieving, the fact that every vote counts. With over 300 million people now in the United States, under a unified country that promotes and exemplifies democracy, we have not been democratic in the sense that peoples vote doesnt even go to their president, only to another mind that can cast you away as if you were not important. As stated in Par. 7 Source 1 an article by the Office of the Federal Register ""Most states have a winnertakeall system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate."" These are the minds that are sometimes chosen at random, or by other factors to represent you, a choice you werent allowed to make. The winner takes all method only takes away from states like Texas and California who know their vote doesnt matter because these people will always agree on democratic or republican, and what is currently used in our society. This damages thousands of voices, thousands of votes that could have matter, but seemingly don't. Just like how schools have implemented the 'No Child Left Behind' policy, we should transcribe this to leaving no american citizen without a voice, only dependant on what state their in.

Theories on how a single vote doesn't matter have been given, as stated in Par. 23 Source 3 by Richard A. posner ""Voters in the presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election."", who also comes to contradict themselves originally with ""Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43% Percent plurality"". In that instance, that one vote could've made a HUGE difference on our future. On top of that, so many voices in states that arent swing states States that could go democratic or republican, and aren't fixated on only 1 party that have been silenced could add up to be a tremendous amount of 'single votes', changing this nations history drastically.

Furthermore onto this argument one thing is known as a world wide factor that applies to almost everything that we do. Simpler, is better. If you take your precious time and read all Par. 18 in Source 1, what you will gather, is that an extremely overafflictionated method is used when determining our next president. Step by step instructions on selecting, choosing, voting, controling, and nevermind the problems it has already caused from the confusion of all these instructions. Something that can be fixed easily by one thing: overriding, fixing, and changing our way to popular vote. This would furthermore simplify our country way of voting, attracting more voters, and overall satisfying many people.

Some have also stated that this is necessary to providing a more organized form of voting. Key knowledge that must be analyzed is that: just because a service is organized, does NOT mean its correct. Referencing to Par. 11 Source 2 Bradford Plumer describes on how ""The American People should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election in a century the system allows for much worse."" and ""that those elctors could always defy the will of the people."" in Par. 9 ""according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after AlGoreThanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency."" Many problems that would not ocurr if our way of voting were to be simplified into popular vote.

To summarize, and simplify what should be done with our voting ways this letter to you, we should remove the electoral college overall and implement the popular voting, to which our country is based off of. This is the most profound way of fixing the problems that we face: the unsimplicity known as our current voting ways, and the restablishment of our original, and hopefully still true government of Democracy, and Popular Soveriegnty.",0
"The author supports the idea well that Venus is a worthy planet to study. The way that people can study venus is to stay above the surface in a blimp, they could build space crafts and rovers out of the strongest material on Earth, and they could also make a submarine like vehicle that is strong enough to with stand the heat and the preasure.

The fact that Venus is a planet that is close to us should make it easy to go to. It is not easy because of the preasure and the heat. A way to get around these issues is to make a blimp that will stay above the surface of the world so then it only gets part of the preasure and heat. Then they can try to get evidence and samples from the surface of the planet to bring back with them to study on earth.

They could get the strongest material on Earth and use it to make space crafts and rovers that will with stand the full heat and preasure. Then the rover could collect samples of gases and rocks. It could also get photographs and videos of what the surface looks like. It could then take everything back to Earth and then humans could study the diffrent samples it collected.

They could make a submarine like vehicle that can withstand the preasure. If they do that then they can collect the samples and figure out if Venus had life on it before. They could find out if Venus could become a new home for humans if it is needed. Then the submarine could send all of the evidence back and then we can study all the evidence we need to study to learn more about Venus.

In Counclusion, they need to make a vehicle out of the strongest material to send down to the suface of Venus and try to collect samples. Then the vechile will come back to Earth with the diffrent materials and then humans would get to work on studying the samples.",0
"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author does a good job of portraying how Venus is worth being studied despite its dangers. They talk about the different dangers in studying Venus, and they also talk about why it is so interesting and why it would be worth studying further.

The author shows this through the text because they clearly state why Venus is considered so dangerous and also why it is so interesting. For example, in paragprah 3, ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide...clouds of corrosive sulfuric acid...temperatures average over 800 degress fahrenheit...atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater that what we experience on our own planet."" These are some examples of the dangers that are presented when trying to study Venus. Despite the dangers, Venus would be worth looking into because it provides new information and a greater knowledge of what environments are like on other planets, for example, in paragraph 4, ""Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" These are some examples of why we should look more into Venus because it has similar features to Earth and it is interesting to figure out why or how they are similar. The author proves their point by explaining that these dangers could potentially be worked around. In paragraph 7, ""Some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditons."" This is showing that while Venus may be very dangerous to observe, there are advanced technologies out there that can lower the risk that comes with studying this planet. As the author stated in paragraph 8, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagaination and innovation."" What the author is trying to get across in this line, is that we should not limit ourselves or limit how much we can know or see solely based on something being too dangerous, when there are innovations out there to make it possible.

These are some of the examples of how the author demonstrates his ideas on why we should study Venus despite the dangers that it presents. The author did a good job presenting his ideas, as shown in the text and examples provided.",0
"Have you ever went to multiple people for advice? Because if so, you are a genius. Asking advice from multiple people, may seem like a bad idea, but I assure you, it's not. Asking for advice from multiple people is a great idea because of these reasons.

When you ask for multiple peoples advice, you will get rid of biases. If you only ask one person, they may have pre-received notions about your situation, and if you try to deal with it yourself, you will have one of the biggest biases, as you're the one who is in the situation. When you ask multiple people, it gets rid of that bias, so that the decision made is not clouded by any personal experiences.

Along with getting rid of biases, it can give a new perspective. Sometimes there are things that you wouldn't think about, and other people can provide that type of view. When you are inside of a situation, it is hard to think outside of the box, especially if it is stressful situation. Without that stress, people can make level headed decisions, and bring a new perspective, which may help.

In addition, asking multiple people may take the weight off your shoulders. If other people can make a good choice, then it will take the weight off your shoulder as you wouldn't have to come up with a solution yourself.

This would help a lot of people, as they would not have to worry about the stress of picking an option.

That is why I think that asking advice from multiple people is a good idea. It gets rid of biases, gives a new perspective, and takes some of the weight off your soldiers. So the next time you are in a dilemma, just ask people for advice.",0
"Dear Senator, ""The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens""Office of the Federal register. Thus, the Electoral College is a balance of votes that includes many different sources for which the President is elected. For this, the Electoral College should be retained due to its contribution to successful elections even though there are some instances which occur and to help the elections remain fair and equal. Additionally, this process should be continued, but there are certain aspects that would argue for changing the aged process.

In Richard poster's, ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,"" he incorporates in his defense, that the electoral votes are awarded in a winnertakeall basis, which means that the states play an important role in the deciding factor of who will become the next President. Posner explained theoretically, ""In 2012's election, for example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and rodney... even a slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoralvote victory in that state"" Posner 1. With this, this shows that the state votes are important and essential to the candidates who are trying to obtain electoral votes in the states. Thus, this method or process is successful in ways many people do not acknowledge. The citizen's votes do matter, when every aspect is put into a big picture and taken into account. Furthermore, the Electoral College allows for everyone to have the chance to be apart of the elections. The Office of the Federal Register explains, ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress"" The Office of the Federal Register 1. This adds support that at the end of the election, almost every part of an election including votes, is taken into consideration, thus making the election a successful one.

In The Office of the Federal Register's excerpt, ""What Is The Electoral College,"" there is certain reasons that further divulge how the Electoral College is fair and equal to the candidates and the citizens who are voting. This is reiterated when The Office of the Federal Register statees, "" Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional Delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators...Office of the Federal Register 1. In addition this means that each state will receive an opportunity to have a meaningful vote to the elections because every state has the same kinds of members being awareded to them. Each state will have a different number of members due to the size, but they will all be of equal value to the candidates. To add for support, Posner says, ""No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president""Posner 1. With this, all the states understand that their vote is crucial to the election and the candidates. Fortunately, the Electoral College is fair and equal to all the state's voting in the election, sometimes even more than some states know. For example, Posner states, "" Voters in toss up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaignto really listen tp the competing candidatesknowing that they are going to decide the election""Posner 1. Ultimately, the Electoral College is the most fair way to decide and vote for a future president who will be our leader of all the citizens.

Lastly, the Electoral College is the best way to determine a president, but there are some flaws. For example, Plumer explains, ""... Thanks to the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote but list the presidency over 60 percent of the voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"" Plumer 1. The elecotral college could alter the outcome of an election dramtically. Another issue that Plumer wants people to know is that, "" Under the electoral collge sysytem, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors..."" Plumerr 1. This is true but also could be a little dramatic. Ultimately, the citizens are the ones who are voting for the candidates not the electors. Without the vote from the citizens there would be no electors. The Electoral College process should still be kept even though there are some issues.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is very important to our modern day elections. The citizens and the states determine who the next Presidents will be. The process provides successful elecions which are fair and equal to not only the people, but the states. Posner states, ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a poltiacl preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election"" Posner 1. The Electoral College makes sure that every person and state vote is accounted for and will be contributed to who the next President will be. One day maybe there will be a process that will exceed the Electral College, but for now, we will trust our founding fathers and keep the process that has been with us since the start.",0
"Automobiles play a huge role in our everyday life. Its how we travel to work, home, and even just to cruize around the neiborhood. But does anyone think about what these traving pieces of machinerary do to our planet? Cars are producing a enviormentally harmful fumes such as greenhouse gas, and smog . These two chemicals are harmful for our ecosystems, as well as our health. It is unnessacary that people should be allowed to kill not only the nature that surrounds us, but also themselves so we need to become a car-free nation.

Giving up driving is like giving up a bad habit, you always have the urge to do it again. But is it all worth it. Think about it, you get up for wor, or school and you walk outside where the sun is shining and the birds are chirping and you think ""Wow it is beautiful out here"". And what do you do... you insert your self into a small metal barrier stoping you from being one with nature. so where am I going with this you might ask. ""When I had a car I was always tense. Im much happier this way."" says Heidrun Walter, a mother of two who gave up her car and decided to walk. When you are driving you can not say hello to your friends, or nighbors. In fact you cant have any social contact which is not healthy.

The U.S. is one of the largest producers, and consumer of motorized transportation devices. Companys such as Ford, Chevy, Jeep, and Lincon are producing cars that no one could refuse. But are they safe? Car companys advertise that they are ""safe"". Airbags, seatbelts, even blind-spot protection moniters are some of the advances in vehical safety technology, but technology does not alway work correctly. Most death tolls are not by murder, or suicide, but by car accidents. So why is it that all this technology that engineers are putting in our auotmobiles are not saving lives? This is why walking or running or cycling is an ideal chioce of transporation, and why automoblies should come to an end.

Im not saying that all cars should be throw into a scrap yard and be forgot about. I know that there are those classic cars that every car collector wants, or that family car that has been passed down for ages. Im just stating that cars use should be reduced for the safty of our planet and ourselves. We always want to keep our old memories. Its just like keeping you grandmothers handmade scrapebook...priceless. We are of nation of collectors that can not and will not get ride of our memories and a car is one of the biggest ones that we can hold on to.

President Obama has goal that he is trying to achives that will lower the greenhouse gas emission say ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal. It is leaders such as Obama that will save this planet, and all we would have to do is become a car-free world. With the help of all the citizens we can become a clean, healthy, and happy world.",0
"Many people seem to believe that ""The Face on Mars"" is alien activity. However, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same heigh as the Face of Mars."" In that quote Jim Garvin, cheif scientist for NASA's Mars Explaration Program, states that he mainly recongnizes it from the land forms on Earth, rather than seeing it as alien actvity.

When the first picture was taken in 1976, technology was not as great as it is now or even in 2001. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared oto 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. Meaning the qualtiy of picture taken in 1976, which convinced most people of alien, did not have great or even decent quality. On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonis for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOS) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the orginal Viking photo.

After taking the picture thousands of anxious we surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing.... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. When this statement was said not everyone was satisfied. The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April of '98-- a cloudy time of the year in the Red Planet. The camera in board had MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics alien markings are hidden in the haze. Which that is a resonable argument, but not being 100% postitive is too risky to throw into the public.

Garvin made an arguement that states, ""As a rule if thumb, you can descern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" he added. ""So, if there were objests in this picture like airplans on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shack, you could see what they were!""

Using all of the evidence and arguments, and just by seeing the picture, it was just a strange occurence that a natural landform found on Mars was shape as a human face. Also the fact that the picture was taken about fourty years ago changes a lot. The amount and the quality of technology has changed tremendosely.",0
"Have you ever thought of the affect of going out after 10 p. m. at night? Night time is the scariest period of the day; nothing is more dangerous and harmful than at night. People would rather stay at home than going out at night. A city council should adopt curfews for teenagers because it is safer, teenagers can stay out of trouble and they can have more time to spend with their family.

However, some people think that curfews would unfairly interfere in young people's lives because they might have an emergency and everyone has freedom to do what they want. In some cases, for instance, teenagers might have an emergency or something important at night that they need to be there as soon as possible, city council cannot let them stay at home. It will be unfair if other people can go out at night, but not teenagers. Everyone has freedom to do what they want, others cannot force teenagers to stay at home everyday after 10 p. m. at night. Although some people think that having curfews are not a good idea, I still insist that the adoption of curfews for teenagers would be a fantastic idea.

In the first place, a city council should adopt curfews for teenagers because it is safer. It is very scary if teenagers hang out at night because someone might follow or kidnap them without they notice. No one knows what is going to happen next. Staying at home not only keep teenagers safe, it also make them be caution to everything around them. Furthermore, teenagers need to protect themselves from others, so that they will not get hurt. In short, it is necessary to adopt curfews for teenagers because they will be safer.

Additionally, it is important for teenagers to have curfews because they can stay out of trouble. Teenagers nowadays have a very playful mind and they would do anything to enjoy themselves; however, they can get into trouble very quickly. Curfews can prevent and stop teenagers from breaking the law. They can stay at home and do something productive and meaningful to themselves. Moreover, curfews can prevent teenagers to meet harmful people outside of the society and make a bad decision. Therefore, a city council should adopt curfews for teenagers because they can stay out of trouble.

Lastly, it is a great idea for a city council to adopt a 10 p. m. weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers because they can have more time to spend with their family. Spending time with their family is the best moment that nobody wants to miss. Instead of going out with people below standard and breaking the rules, teenagers can have a wonderful time with their family at home. Because of curfews, the relationship between teenagers and their family will grow and be healthier. To sum up, it is nice to have curfews because it helps build up a better relationship.

In conclusion, it is the best idea to have a city council adopt curfews for teenagers because it can protect teenagers from danger and risk, they will less likely get into future conflicts, and they can have an enjoyable time to spend with their family. Curfew benefits both teenagers and the law. Curfews can raise the world to a higher level and make a clean society for all teenagers. Let's make the adoption of curfews come true! ",0
"The Electoral College has been used for years. I agree that we must keep it this way. Yes, It is possible that the outcome of the popular vote that the people have chosen is not in agreement but it has been the best way of selecting a President. It is highly unlikely that when the people vote for certain selection of the candidates group of electors will change their mind. It has happened before but It's rare. I suggest that the electoral college stay, and not change the election because It has not only been used for years, but also some of the citizens may make a mistake in who they vote for, and atleast with the Electoral College we can make sure we have the right President.

Each Candidate has their own electors and it take 270 of electoral votes to choose a President and since they are from the same group, they wouldn't choose someone else. It has happened in 2000, as it says in the excerpt. This system has been used for years, why change it now. The Electoral college has worked this way for years, the founding fathers came up with it as a good process. It is completely fair to all. The people get to select their candidate and the electors know what their responsibilities are. The citizens aren't completely able to control the electors ideas but they might have a bit more knowledge on the subject.

some citizens may get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate excerpt from passge. This refers to the fact that we may have chaos if we let the people decide directly who is our President. We need an insider to review our peoples choices and make sure that it is the correct one, and what better way than to have the Electoral College do it. It depends on the state and the candidate's political party, In which you chose. The People will get what they asked for, their has been times In which it that is not always the case, but the electors usually make the decision the people has asked for.

As said in the passage ""In defense of the Electoral Collage"", Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee, and the trust is rarely betrayed, This system is the best one yet. Our people are well informed but not always, If we take out the Electoral college, we are leaving our country in their hands and people make mistakes sometimes, with the electoral college we have various people making the right decision.

It's like when an author writes a book, they don't get it published right away, they have people to make sure their spelling is correct and they make many other different corrections. It's the same with the Electoral college and the way the president is selected. As my state senator, I suggest we keep this system.",0
"Dear Mr or Mrs senator I think we should keep our method of choosing our state president. it more easier then any other method. Also it less time consuming.

College voting method is the most easiest method to use. All we have to do is vote and who ever gets the most votes win. I think its just a fair method to use. I feel like the other method is just to complex so we should stick to the college voting method. almost half of the time to president we choose is the right president for the US.

Another reason we should keep the college method is because it wouldnt take that long. All we really just have to do is vote and in no time our president will be in office.

in conclusion I think we should keep the college method because its less time consuming and its an easier process.",0
"The author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computer to identify human emotions by letting know people detect exactly how other people are feeling without being tell about it.

The Monalisa has been used for this discovery,

Dr. Paul Eckman is the creator of FACS, also they uses a computer to created 3-D model of the face basics emotions.

First, the author describe how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computer to identify human emotions by a computer. This portrays that the technology has been update to let people have more knowledge about this new era. The Monalisa has been used for this discovery. The text says"" She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" This show us that by just looking at their face we can't notice all this emotions on this paint of Leonardo da Vinci's.

Second, the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computer to identify human emotions just by looking at their normal face. This shows how the technology have been update upon all this year, every year that pass, more discovery are treaten at the world. Dr. Paul Eckman is the creator of the FACS. The text says "" Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happines, suprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness."" This means that the new discovery of Dr. Paul Eckman can identify 6 basic emotions.

Third, the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions by showing people thier emotion in only one picture of them. This new technology shows how people can have their knowlegde in this topic withot being an expert. To do this discovery they uses computer to created a 3-D model of the face basics emotions. The text says "" The process begins when the computer construcs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" This means that all the 6 emotions are associated with each charactheristic movements of the facil muscles.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System is usesfull to know the characteristic movement of the facial muscles.",0
"Electoral Colleges is something many people disagree with but there is a few that are for the idea. Personally i think we should get rid of the Electoral colleges for many reasons. First, when using the electoral college you do not vote for the president but you vote for a slate of electors, I think when you are voting you should have a choice for which president you vote for not electors. Using this, the electors have to win which I dont think is right.

Using electoral votes effects the people in smaller states. Big states have more of a ""voice"" to who wins the election if enough people vote. People living in smaller states have less of a chance of there choosen president to win because they dont have a large number of electoral votes. Saying that people in the smaller states know that they dont have much of a say to votes and are going to stop voting in general and stop paying attention to the campaigns.

The winnertakeall method is something that voters dont like. Candidates know that some states dont have a lot of electoral votes so they dont bother to reach out to them and dont spend time on them because they think or know they dont have a chance of winning their election. Since candidates dont go to small states that means they spend all their time in the bigger states trying to win them over and get their votes. People dont think its fair that the candidates dont make any effort to pay attention to them.

When you vote for who you want as president you dont actually vote for the president you vote mostly for a slate of electors. from the excerpt from ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" stated it is the electors that vote for presidents not us. i think that we should have more of a choice for who we want as our president but we do not. We should get rid of the Electoral College because it doesnt help us as i can see many people do not like it.",0
"I think that we should change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. If we keep the Electoral College, then even if you do earn the most individual votes, you might not be elected president. If you have earned the most individual votes then you should be elected president because you have the majority vote. If we keep the electoral College then if you are elected president but do not receive the majority of the individual votes, the president elected by the Electoral College will not be a popular president to the people who voted against them.

Source 2 says, ""Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" So with the Electoral College, the electors that are chosen might not elect those who they said they would. But with election by popular vote, the person elected will always be who the majority of the country wants as president.

Source 1 states, ""Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators."" So some states have more votes than others. If someone who is running get more states to vote for them, it does not mean that they will be elected because they have to get more votes overall from the electors.

Source 3 says, ""The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people."" So with the Electoral College, even though the people vote, they are not the ones who are electing the president. Source 3 also says, When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors."" So whoever you are voting for, you dont know if the slate of electors will vote in that direction.",0
"First impressions is always something that i pay attention to when meeting a person for the first time. I will always agree with the fact that first impressions are almost impossible to change. Why? imagine meeting a person and the only thing you think about when they cross your mind is the way they first greet you or the way that they introduced themselves to you.

For instance, in my opinion, i feel that people will always put on a different character for their ""first impression"". For example, calling a job for a interview is something you'd want to change your normal character into a more formal and nice responsible person. You can never change your very first thought of someone, it may change later but not the first second of your conversation. Another example could be is getting someone introduced to you from a friend. On the other hand, there's always an ""i wonder"" question in my mind about everyone, because it's totally normal. When meeting someone new there is many of ways people act towards you. They may act shy and make you feel awkward, or they may act friendly and make you feel welcome. So, with that saying, you can never change the way you first think of someone, first impressions will always be a permanent statement that your brain can't erase.

Accordingly, if you do have the abilities, you can always tell what type of person they are. With just one impression someone can teach you about themselves a bit, theres no doubt in that. It's fun of how our brains permanently label people from our first impression until it is changed to something else. For example, imagine seeing some person that is always quiet, always seems like their mad or doesn't want to be at the function. What first impression would you get from that person? I would honestly not even bother to talk to them, they could say anything mean to me, But with first impressions changing overtime, you never know once that person starts talking they wont stop smiling or talking. You never know truly about something until you experiment it.

In conclusion, the first day of school where you have to introduce yourself, or being at public place and someone asks you for something in a nice way, what do you think about that person? From first impressions, after seeing that person for the second time you would always go back and think about how the first time went. While getting to know them that same thought changes about them because now you truly know who they are. The first times will always be different than the regular times. I will always agree that it is impossible for first impressions to change because of our natural human traits.             ",0
"Individuality

I am agree to be independent in a world is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment, because you can feel proud of yourself. Independent means that you have the control of the you doing, also signify not looking to others for one's opinions or for guidance in conduct. I think that when you decide make the things for yourself is because you are ready to confront the different situations that the life give you.

The individuality is one that pursues a markedly independent course in thought or action. That means that your actions have influence in you, all that you doing have a purpose.

For example, when you want something but is spend, you work hard for it, and can get it. This going to make you happy because just you know how you worked for buy it.

Be yourself in the world is not simple, need to have good thoughts, these are the key for the most big accomplishment. For example, when someone tell you do this, you need to think about it, and decide it is good or not , if is something bad that going to affect you. Some people no want that you win or protrude in the life, or not believe that you can do. But you need have the capacity to show them, that you can and not need help for obtain it.

Accomplishment is the quality or ability, the result of something. Make big accomplishment for yourself, teach you that you can do all that you want, but only if you believe and have trust in you. Sometimes we don't something that we want for fear, because think that the result not going to be favorable or how you thoughts. For example, sometimes many opportunities came for your life, and you never accept. But when you take the decisions of do, you see that is possible. Now know that you are able to do anything that you want.

In my conclusion be yourself in the world is good, because your learn about the life, also to do things that you not believe possible. I think that good thoughts can make you successful. Also I think that do all individuality is not easy, but not impossible. The biggest accomplishment only are caused when you do things for yourself. That is why I think that be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.",0
"How do you now there is an intellegent life form making these so-called supernatural phenomona? The fact's show that this is just a natural landform. I know the other side to this. You might be thinking to yourself""Why does it look like a face in the 1976 picture,Then suddenly goes back to a ""natural""landform.""The answer to your question would be that the image was unclear and really blurd in 1976,and as technology evolves the image gets sharper and cleaner. Thats when people start to think ""How did this face on a planet we know little to nothing about desapear of the span of 25 years.""Thats where conspiracy therios come in,and then we get protesters and signs say""NASA is lying""then we get no funding because of the conspiracy. the point here is that this is a perfectly scientific,logical phenomena that we can explain with a simple theroy. Erosion of time is one of the reasons there are so many land slides or avalanches. The mars ""face"" may have been a face at one point because it is a landform. Erosion is a simple little matter of eroding and object over time with the natural elimates and/or manmade objects. That is why The face on mars is not a face but Just mesa or a butte.",0
"INTRODUCTION

The Mona Lisa is one paint that is famous in the world, according to some new computer software can reconise emotions in people, this system is a innovation of Prof. Thomas Haung, of the Beckman and is working with Prof. Nicu Sebe, they will have help from Dr. Paul Eckman institute of Advanced Science at the University of Illinois man, creator crator of FACS.

BODY

This system has some questions that people thikn, howcan a computer recognize subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel? Dr. Haung said that the procces begins when the computer structs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Dr. Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness - and then assosiated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"" observes Dr. Haung.

A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Haung predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. Most human communication is nonverval, including emotional communication, notes Dr. Haung. According to the Facila Feedback Theory of Emotion, muving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also help to produce them. whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the scien of emotions.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion i tink that this program fantastic because can know how we feal, it identify human emotions just looking our face, it is a nice system because i can know if one person that a love is sad, happy, angry, etc. i thik that this system is goin to be important in the future.",0
"The author who wrote this line was very smart based in the life actuality the people when say, "" you will never grow"" I'm agree with the author I think in this world some people not are conform with the that have. However the problem is that some people are avaricious, think that are better that others people and want all at the same time.

The first reason is that some people are avaricious, is a bad influence for the people that want grown in the jobs, school and in the milieu family, for example my brother not finish the school, Because He like the money and He think the best solution will be leak of the school for work more and have more money. And now He say that is not good idea leave the school for money.

So they's think that are better that other people, for the society cause indifference to the other people, rejection would be also bulling. I am disagree with the thought of this type of people for example, if she/he can make something grand also the other people can the major greatness is the humility.

The third reason is want all at the same time, when the author talk about ""you will never grow."" Is because the knowledge of the life is not obtain things materials amount, because in this life all is vanity if you want grow start for conform with the little that you have for example, the education help for that you will be a good person with principles.

The conclusion is that the life have many opportunities bad you have the option take one opportunity. For that you can grow and can be a good person, and be intelligent because the vanity is bad adviser.",0
"Dear State Senator,

Ever since our founding fathers established in the constitution that the president and vice president votes were determined by electoral college, the founding fathers made a good decision. Electoral College is a process where electors gather for a meeting and count the electoral votes to determine the new president and vice president. The United States should keep Electoral College to determine the president and vice president rather than a popular vote because Electoral College avoids run-off elections, and Electoral College is more fair than a popular vote.

To start off, Electoral College should continue to determine the president and vice president voting rather than popular votes because electoral college avoids run-off elections. If somebody was running for either president or vice president and they recieved thirty percent in popular votes, nobody would know if the person with thirty percent popular vote would win the election. Electoral College prevents confusion by producing a clear winner. For example, in source 3, the text reads ""Richard Nixon in 1968 and Bill Clinton in 1992 had only forty-three percent of popular votes but both had three-hundred and plus electoral votes which made them win the election"". The president and vice president make sure our country is running well and that we as a country have no problems. If we were to determine our president and vice president by a popular vote, whoever could kiss up more to the voters would win the election even if the person running doesn't meet up to the qualifacations of the person they are running against. Avoiding a run-off election is very important because no canidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. Also, if a popular vote was how the president and vice president were decided, not as much people would pay attention to voting because voters have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign of the people running for president and vice president.

Furthermore, Electoral College should continue to determine the president and vice president voting rather than a popular vote because Electoral College is more fair than a popular vote. In 2008 when Barack Obama won his election to become the 44th president of the United States, he didn't win by being the popular canadite, Obama won by his passion to make this country better than it already is. For example, in source 1, the text reads ""The electoral college consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electorial votes is required to elect the president"". That way of electing the president is more fair than a popular vote because you need 270 electors to say yes to make you president rather than people making you president by if your popular or not. Electoral College is what keeps our elections fair. There is no other way to elect somebody president becuase no other method will be this successful than Electoral College. After all, Electoral College has been the way to elect the president since the constitution was created. Popular Voting is a bad method if were used to determine the president and vice president because somebody who is running for president can manipulate people to think he or she is a good canidate for president when they really aren't.

To conclude, Electoral College should continue to decide the president rather than popular votes becuase Electoral College avoids run-off elections, and Electoral College is more fair than popular votes. Why should we change the way we elect president if this method has been working for over 200 years? Electoral College should continue to decide the presidency for years to come because it works so well. That's why Electoral College will stay as the way to elect the president.

"Did you know in 1976 a picture was taken of a ""face"" on Mars?

Most people believe that it is a sign that there is life on Mars or a sign of aliens. But, people who agree with NASA know it is actually just a mesa. There is two sides to this picture of a ""face"" either you think it is a sing of life or it is a mesa. So, the figure similar to a face isn't a face because it is similar to landforms on Earth, the figure is to big to be a real face, and it is actually a mesa.

Matter of fact, the figure/landform on Mars similar to a ""face"" is a lot like landforms on planet Earth. For example,""'It reminds me most of Middle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,' says Garvin.""(12) This quote provides evidence that the figure/landform on Mars is similar to landforms on Earth. So, this is evidence that the figure on Mars is just a landform like what we have on Earth.

Next, the figure similar to a ""face"" is to big to be a real face. For example,""An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end.""(1) This quote shows that the head is to big to be a real face. Like, what face is two miles long from end to end?

Last but not least, the figure/landform similar to a ""face"" is actually a mesa! For example,""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa - landforms common around the American West.""(12) This quote proves that the figure/landform is just a mesa. There is no life on Mars or aliens making signs. It is simply just a common landform.

Finally, the figure/landform similar to a face isn't a face. It isn't a face because it is a common landform on Earth. It is way to big to be a real face. Also, the figure/landform is simply just a mesa. These are all reasons and proof that the landform on Mars isn't a sign of life or aliens it is just a common landform.",0
"Is the use of a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System valuable to read the emotional expressions of sudents in a classroom?. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'alto, the author describes how a new technolgy called the Facial Action Coding System enables computer to identify human emotions. It is a new software that has been developed that improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others, and, has promissing applications for a variety of industries. The use of this new technology is valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom because it recognizes whether a sudent is boring or confused, it detects 6 basic emotions and even mixed and it hepls the person not only to express the emotions but to produce them.

School brings a lot of emotions to the students, they might be good or bad feelings. But the most common feelings seen by the techers are boredom, and confusion from the students, sometimes the teachers are not able to identify those emotions, since students just might fake a smile and the teacher will be satisfied that the student is doing just fine or thewy might be confused but afraid to speak up so they just sit there like everything is just normal. So, how might the teacher be able to identify these emotions? The Facial Action Coding System has the answer. In the passage it states ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". It also states ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective e human instructor"". By this evidence , the author tries to persuade the reader to get more into this new technology and how it is just not a software but a valuable thing. With this technology it would be easier for the teacher to identify when one or more students are bored; this would allow them to think throught about changing a new method to teach so the studetns don't get bored in class. It also helps them to notify when a student is confused on a topic, so the teacher would be able to take the necessary time to explain and explain until the student is able to understand the new topic learned. The mayority of students nowdays don't care about school or just don't get the new topic learned, but teachers try their best to help them, but they think everything is just fine, so they don't bother on asking or trying harder. Communication is the key to success but they don't implement it, so what is best than a new tehnology to help out a little.

There are 6 basic emotions; happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness and there are even people that have not only one but two mixed emotions at the same time.. Wouldn't it be great to be able to recognize when a person is having these emotions?. This new technology is here to help. In the passage it states ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions... and then associated with characteristic movements of the facial muscles"". It also states ""The software can even identify mixed emotions (as in Da Vinci's masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face(showing no emotion)"". This evidence illustrates by the aouthor shows how great and advanced this technology is, being able to identify not only one emotion, but more than one at the same time, letting the world know, but most important the teachers in a classroom that they don't have to worry more about to be able to identify by guessing how a student is doing, because this technology has the answers. It is so hard to identify when a person is feeling all types of feelings and not be able to help out becuase no one knows what the mixed feelings are . Teachers have a rough time with students trying to figure it out. But with ths technology teahcers would be more notified of the problem, so they create a scenari to help them out.

Emotions are everywhere, everyone experience at least one of them. This new technology not only helps the person to express an emotion but to produce them. A teacher in a classroom is able to teach but sometimes they are not able to transmit the feeling of learing to the students, and the new technology Facial Action Coding System would be a lot of help. In the passage it states ""The Mona Lisa is really intented to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do"". It also states ""Most human communication is nonverbal, incluiding emotional communication"". By this evidence the author projects how this new technology is capable of doing just anything and how it helos to improve the best on a classroom, helping out not only the students but the teachers. With this new technology teachers would be able to get the students to be more interested in the class, leading them to get a good grade, and to the understanding of every new topic.

Now, Do you think this new technology called the Facial Action Coding System is valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom?. By being able to detect 6 basic emotions and even mixed emotions, to recognize whether a student is bored or confused and by helping the person not only to express the emotion but to produce it, it is shown that this new technology is valuable. Communication is one of the basic steps to create a better living world but sometimes communication is just not implemented in society. So the help of this new technology is needed. A teacher woulld be able to help a student is they knew if the students where confused or bored. They would try different types of ways to get back the attention of the students so they can do good in the calls. Another reason is being able not only to know one emotion but multiple emotions; Teachers wouldn't have to be guessing the emotions of the studetns, and the time lose trying to guess their emotions, they would be finding ways to help the student solve their problem, becuase they already know what is going on. In the classroooms it is very hard for the sdtudents to concentrate in a very boring topic, and the teachers just will continue beuase the sdtudents just don't communicate or show anything else than just a black emotion and this new technology is able to get the person to express the emotion. Is really interesting what this technology can do.",0
"Highways, roads, streets they are everywhere. No matter where you are or what part of town, these are always found nearby. Wherever roads are found, so are cars. People have been driving vehicles since the 1950's and over time, have had many positive effects on the world but they have also had many negative effects. Luckily, the government has been helping to reduce car usage to save the world. Limiting car usage helps the world become a better place by decreasing pollution and keeping individuals active.

According to Elisabeth Rosenthal, cars make up ""12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe"" and can be responsible for ""50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States,"" In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars. These percentages show how much humans rely on cars, which is negatively impacting countries. Greenhouse gases are extremely awful for the environment, and if they are not decreased significantly, then the Earth could become a bad place for existence. In many places, government officials have been trying to limit the percentage coming from cars, which has helped greatly. Rosenthal claimed in a different article, The End of Car Culture, that ""As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was...equal to where the country was in January 1995."" The drop of this percentage has decreased the amount of greenhouse gases in the world. Many events all over the world have contributed to the lower percentage. For example, the CarFree Day in Bogota, Columbia has been a huge hit since the mid 1990's and is continuing to grow each year Andrew Selsky, CarFree Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota. This activity along with others will continue to bring the percentage down until it is hopefully extremely small.

Fast food and the lack of exercise has increased the number of obese people greatly. With a lack of transportation, there is a bigger opportunity for individuals to eat healthier and exercise more. Andrew Selsky, a writer from the Seattle Times published an article about Bogota's CarFree Day. He confirmed that ""It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths,"" CarFree Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota. The building of new sidewalks has increased the number of people using them each day. With more people walking and exercising, the rate of obesity should decrease dramatically. Not only is exercising important, but eating healthy is as well. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal, cities in Germany are now stating, ""stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway,"" In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars. Since there can only be a limited number of shops in the city because they have to be close by, healthier options have been chosen more often, keeping people in shape. Not only do the individuals look healthier, but they feel better.

Saving the Earth and other people are two huge causes for limiting car usage. Keeping both alive and healthy can keep everyone happy and safe. Reducing car usage has great advantages and all humans should consider different methods of transportation walking, bking, or even carpooling are great alternatives to help the world. It may not seem like it now, but the decision of limiting car usage can be a life or death situation.",0
"""An opinion can act like a guiding hand in a dark tunnel,"" said Generic_Name. Sometimes we find ourselves in situations where we have no idea what to do. Whether to take a right or a left or take one job over another. The decisions we make effect how we live for the rest of our lives. So, it is important that we make our decisions with careful thought, and when we need help with our decisions that we reach out to the people we trust for guidance. I believe that seeking multiple opinions can help us make better decisions because some people are wiser than others, some people know you better, and because some people have really strong opinions for or against something without considering what is best for you.

First, wiser people who have had to make difficult decisions might give better advice rather than someone who has had a perfect life. Adults and elders are a great example of that because they have had to make serious and difficult decisions that have shaped them into who they are today. They have lived through so many of the struggles we go through and they understand the emotions and fear that contribute to our decision making. Those adults and elders have more than likely had to make the same exact decision that we are struggling to make, so they can use past experiences to lead us in the right direction.

Other people might know you better, and regardless of the situation they do what is best for you. Those are the people I listen to most, because they know you and know what you should do based off of who you are as a person. Right now I am facing a difficult decision of choosing between my friends, who have been fake recently, or a boy, who can never seem to make up his mind. I have asked so many different people for advice on what I should do, and the opinion that suck out the most was the one of my closest friends. She told me that I needed to follow my heart and do what I thought was best regardless of what other people thought I should do. No matter what I do in this situation I'm losing a big part of me and the people that have made me who I am, but it's relieving to know that the people who know what type of person I am support me in whatever decision I make.

Lastly, we sometimes listen to those who have a strong opinion for or against something without even considering what is best for you. Those people are very selfish, and if we aren't careful we will listen to them. In my boy vs. friends situation I have asked these type of people whose opinions are so strong, rather it's what is best for me or not. They're so for one side and their opinions are so strong it seems like they know they are talking about. They often times have very good arguments on why they think what they think and what they are saying might be true. However, it isn't always what I need to hear or what is best for me and my life.

That is why seeking all these different opinions can help us make the best decision. Some people have very good arguments while others just know us better. If we only listened to one person our whole life when it came to decision making our life would turn into theirs and we would practically be living the life they want to live. I especially don't want someone to be living through me and controlling my life through different mind games. It is important that we listen to what others have told us, but we form our own opinions and do what we think is best for us. The decision that we make for ourselves will most likely be the best decision.",0
"Bycicles. Walking. Public buses.  All three are alternatives to driving a car to arrive at places that you need to go.  Some believe that having an automobile is essential to everyday life.  Others may say that cars are unnecessary and a pollutant in our society.  There are many advantages of limited car usage.

Limiting the use of cars could help reduce the amount of pollutants in our environment.  In Source two, it states, ""Cold nights and warm air caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emission.""  This tells us that car emissions are being caught in the air due to the weather, causing a layer of smog to settle over congested cities.  By limiting the use of automobiles, the layer of smog was able to vanish, but if we were able to limit cars permanently, then we would not have to worry about it in the first place.  In Source four, it tells us that, ""If the pattern persists... it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions.""  This proves that car emissions are harmful to the environment and that future generations are at risk because of the pollution already in the air.  Also, the statement shows that Americans are very dependant on transportation, but are unwilling to try a different method such as walking and biking.  By reducing the number of cars on the road, our environment would be helped tremendously.

Having to worry about driving a car may produce more stress in a persons life.  In Source three, it says, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""  This tells us that riding in an automobile, while the roads are very crowded, causes people to worry about whether or not they are going to be in an accident.  Also, it has been proven that exercise helps to lower stress, and by riding a bike instead of driving a car, stress may be lowered by simply using your resources to get where you need to go.  In Source one, it tells us, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier now. (Heidrun Walter, mother of two).""  This proves that people are worried about their car and if it might break down, or something worse.  Something can always go wrong with a car, whether it be trouble with the engine or you accidently locked your keys inside, and it becomes very expensive when you have to fix a small blunder.  By limiting car ownership, less people have to worry about their automobile.

A great alternative to owning a car is public transportation.  In Source four it explains, ""They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.""  By uses others means of tranportation, it makes it very convenient for kids to meet up with their friends for a while, and still get to where they need to go.  Also, public transportation is much cheaper than buying a car and gas for it, and it helps reduce the number of cars on the road.  In Source two, it tells us that ""Public transit was free of charge for Friday to Monday.""  By taking the bus that the government provided people received free transportation, allowing them to not have to worry about parking, gas prices, or potential accidents.  They could travel wherever they needed to go on a very convinient mode of transportation for no cost to them.  Public transportation, or car-pooling, is an amazing way to lower the number of cars on the road, while still providing people with a way to be driven to the destination they need to get to.

Automobiles, the plugs to the sinks of the streets of the world, seem to clog up the efficient system of transportion.  Parents, workers, and athletic kids alike are affected by the large number of cars on the road.  By reducing the number of cars on the road, there would be a direct impact on our environment, emotions, and future generations.",0
"Limiting the usage of cars has a varirty of advantages. From having a less expensive life, to less air pollution, and overall a generally happier life. Thinking about all the excess and stress that comes with owning a car is tiring. Not to mention the hazardous effect it had on our lives. Would it not be nice to just take off some of that burden off of you, and be a happier person?.Let me help you out on how to achieve that.

Owning a car is pricey! In Freiburg along with paying for your house you also have to pay for a parking garage, which comes with a hefty price. Did i not mention the distance you have to walk to park? lets just say you might as well have taken the bus.""Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park---large garages at the edge of the development,where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.""(source one,section two). With you alone driving to work and back everyday will tally up to over a hundred dollars spent every week, now add children into it, and their after school ativities, also add emergencies. See where this is going? sure you might need a car now and then, having a car is not a bad thing. How about Carpooling? It will reduce that price you have on your gas recipts and create more time for bonding and interacting with people.

Health or driving? Well if you are not healthy you can not drive can you? With all of the automobiles we have today it is bound to affect the earth. The smog in the air leading to that first cough that can lead to something more terminal. Imagine what it would be like if you had less cars, or even no cars at all! well the capital of France tried it and the results were amazing.""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog..""(source two,section fourteen).  Now think about if that ban that Paris enforced,was tried out in other countries. Just that little change in the amount of cars on the road let to that difference of the pollution. Probably led to a difference in someones health too.

Everything stated above leads to happiness, from the less expences that will have to be paid, and the less damage that the pollution will have on your health. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter""source one, section three).Also when there are less cars on the road your community will be able to connect more and have better infranstructure, which would make them  happy just like it did for the people of Bogata, Columbia.""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks;rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic;and new resturants and upscale shopping districts have been cropped up.""(source three,section twenty-eight).

Overall the advantages of limiting car usage has many benefits to it. From having a less expensive life, by not having to pay for gas so often, car insurance, and evrything else that comes with it. Having better health also is a advantage of the limitation of car usage. Also one of the most important aspects of life, happiness comes with the limitation of using cars. So there is no reason to not try it out, there will be more benefits.",0
"I make mistakes. Lots of them if you ask my mom. Everytime I lie, say a word a should not have said, or say something mean. I find myself looking for advice that will help me fix what I have done. The people I ask for advice are my mom, my dad, my sisters, and my friends. I think it is important to seek multiple opinions to make the best choice because I need different points of view, I can see common answers, and not everyone is going to understand.

First of all, I need to see different points of view. My mom, my dad, my sisters, and my friends will all see a situation under a different light. For example if I lie, my mom, my dad, and my sisters will tell me to apologize, while my friends tell me to ignore the person I lied to. I may want to ignore the person I lied to, but I see my family's perspective and apologize. All of the advice I was given was for a good reason, but the different points of view help me see what the correct thing to do is. Getting different points of view will always help you make a better choice.

Secondly, common answers will show up. If a piece of advice shows up in everyone I talk to, then I see a common theme and know what to do. For example if I cuss, not that I have, everyone will advise me to think before I speak. In my opinion everyone giving the same advice makes that advice pretty common. Even if one person tells me to keep cussing, holding my tongue is the most repeated advice. Everytime I get multiple opinions, I always look for common answers to help me make the best choice.

Lastly, not everyone understands. We have all aggressively said the words, ""You don't understand!"" Believe it or not that is true. Not everyone understands or can understand what you are going through. Everyone has been mean to someone. That can not be argued against, but not everyone gets advice about how to stop being mean. When I get advice for how to stop, my family does not understand. They just do not get why I want to fix that problem. No matter how much I ask for their advice they will not give it to me. My friends, on the other hand, know what it is like. They understand why I do not want to be mean any longer. Finding people who understand will help you make the best choice.

In conclusion, when looking for advice you should look for three things. Different points of view, common answers, and people who understand. No one single person is perfect. We all make mistakes, some may make more than others, but in the end that does not matter. Everyone lies, cheats, steals, and cusses, so we all need advice. When I look for advice, I always seek multiple opinions to make the best choice.",0
"Cars are like beneficial disadvantages they allow you to arrive at your destination in a short amount of time, but they add to the world's pollution growing issue. Individuals in every single part of the world own cars and millions of cars are on our streets and highways daily. Whether it is to comute to work or visit a friend in the next town over, individuals are constantly on the road. While cars do simplify our lives today, in the near future cars will become a burden, due to the amount of pollution they produce and the stress they cause upon individuals. Limiting car usage in all parts of the world will bring more joy and persistent smiles.

Cars play a dramatic role in the amount of pollution that is in our air today. Which is also essential for our survival. Limiting car usage will decrease the amount of pollution we have today and the disgusting greenhouse gas emissions. ""Up to 50 percent"" of green house gas emissions alone are caused by carintense areas in the United States acknowledged by Elisabeth Rosenthal, in the article "" In German Suburb, Life goes on Without Cars "". Furthermore, in the capital of France due to ""intensifying smog 60 percent"" of the individuals were in a severe traffic jam explained by Robert Duffer, in "" "". The smog was caused by cold nights and warm days and the warmer layer of air imprisoning car emissions and pollution pollution being caused by over usage of cars, meaning car usage should be limited if not halted all at once.

Individuals participating in events like Carfree day and living in towns like Vauban tend to be a lot more joyful and enthusiastic. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" said by an individual named Heidrun Walter, who moved to Vauban for a more jubilating experience. Cars add stress due to having to be stuck in agonising traffic and having to pay for ridiculous gas prices. Also, by limiting car usage you'll witness and hear more individuals enjoying themselves walking the street, and ""the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drowning out the occasional distant motor."" described by Robert Duffer, in "" In German Suburb, Life goes on Without Cars "". Evenmore so, by abandoning your vehicle at home you won't have to deal with enebidable traffic and ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" brought up by Andrew Selsky, in source 3 "" Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota "". Carless stress less.

Before saying cars are benefitial think of all the disadvanteges that they hold. All the disadvanteges out weigh the advantages. Pollution no matter how big or small is a humungous issue that can be prevented little by little by limiting car usage. Also, limited smiles will become persistent smiles if you limit car usage across the nation. More smiles and less cars is the way to go.",0
"Are cars beginning to go out of fashion? Over the last few years, fewer and fewer people are getting their driver's license, and less people are buying cars. That's because walking or taking public transportation where you need to go can be more beneficial than driving. Using alternative transportation decreases stress, lowers air pollution, and eliminates the cost of owning a car. These reasons are causing people to eliminate personal vehicles out of their lives.

To begin, using alternative transportation can lower stress. Millions of people around the world face the same problem every morning and afternoon: traffic. Traffic jams cause people to be late for work, causing their stress levels to go up. Stress can lead people into depression or become tense. Eliminating a car from someone's life can allow them to be happy. Instead of driving, many people are starting to walk to work, or take a public bus to where they need to go. If more people begin to stop driving, the roads will be less jammed, which will lower road congestion, leading to less stress. Getting rid of your car can be a key element to eliminating stress.

Second, walking or taking a bus lowers air pollution. In France, air pollution was so bad, the government set a oneday ban on driving motorvehicles. Instead, residents could take public busses free of charge, or walk. Anyone who decided to drive their vehicle on the day they were banned, faced a 31 fine. Another city in Colombia also started a similar campaign. Government officials in Bogota, Colombia set a one day ban in the city called ""the Day Without Cars"". The turnout was large, people rode busses, rode bikes, or walked to wherever they needed to go. This eliminated traffic james, and lowered air pollution. Violaters of the ban had to pay a 25 fine. Other countries surely will soon do the same thing.

Lastly, the cost to own a car is far too expensive. Buying a car leads to many problems. the cost of paying off your car after you buy it can overwhelm many people. Having to pay hundreds of dollars every month to repair your car or pay for gas can lead you into debt. Many individuals have become homeless because they can't afford to pay for the things they need, such as a car. Without a car, you save thousands of dollars you can use to pay off other things you might owe.

To conclude, using alternative transportation instead of a car can be very beneficial. It lowers stress, eliminates air pollution, and eliminates the expenses of a car. More and more people are beginning to outlaw cars from their lives, and it is helping the world as well as themselves.",0
"So we come here to discuss a topic. A very intresting one if you say. This topic has history to it and some people don't like this topic. Some people don't like this topic because of the way it works. This thing i'm talking about is the Electoral College. And I personally don't like this thing. that is because it is so outdated and unfair. Look at the 2000 election. Al Gore, an amazing guy, ""had more individual votes then George w. Bush."" This guy would of been a great president but  ""Bush won the election, receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266."" I believed this was unfair because one person could of one but another man had got more ""popularity"" votes and won. Now tell me why that is fair?

To start this fire burning inside me, the Electoral College is so outdated and unfair. ""The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualifed citizens."" This means that the people of the state can vote buts it really not going to count. These people want a good president and it happened in 2012. Alot of Southern states like Mitt Romney and they voted for him. He got alot of votes and was beating Obama. But Obama got""61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percentpf the votes for Romney."" Romney had change in his eyes and the Electoral College didnt care and took that away from him.

To conclude this, the Electoral College is unfair. They take people's chances to change this country and do new things for us. If we had Mitt Romney, America might of had better imployment and a better system. We would of probulay had more money and had a better chance of going to college. But the Electoral College is unfair and had to take that away from Mitt and gave it to Obama. It's so outdated and unfair. For God's sake, its from 1700's! We need to get a better system of voting next time or people or just stop going to vote because they will know thay their votes mean nothing to the college and they will stop. If these people stop voting.... then we better have a backup plan to restore the country.",0
"People and students' have some amazing talents and skills. Talents are very impressing and challenging for an example,people that can juggle with oranges or bottles and people that can sing. Some talents can be very difficult at first and people can give up easily but when people practice and they try they do not give up. The skills and talents I enjoy the most is playing the violin,cooking,and makeup on my own time.

When people play the violin they say It is very difficult and it is very boring. Some adults that have played the violins and the chelos are very talented and their skills are by playing the violin Is just slowly moving the bow towards up and slowly moving it down. When I first played the violin It was not easy moving the bow fast towards the bridge of the violin and knowing the songs that some students' had to play by their self. When I had my first Pyrimid Concert In Elementary school I had a great time playing and learning how to play the violin.

Cooking is another talent that some people like to enjoy while they are home or they help their mom cook. Cooking can be fun and people can experience new kinds of food that they never tried. When I was little I always wanted to cook with my mom and she cooked all different kinds of food like Rice with Chicken,she made Pizza,and also baked Cookies and Inchiladas. They are resturants that have good flavor foods like when people go to the Buffet or to IHOP.When I cook with my mom or my sister I experience that cooking can be hard because people do not know what ingrediants they have to use or the taste is disgusting.

Makeup Is one of the funest. They are some teenage girls that love to do their own makeup or they just do it for fun. A lot of teenage girls start learning how to do makeup by watching on the internet step by step. Teenage girls have really good talents in fashion and using good color shade on thier eye lid. Talents In makeup are fun when people have their own time with their firends when they come over. Some girls feel more comfortable by using makeup and some girls do not. Makeup can be enjoyable and fun to experience.

They are some difficult talents and skills that people give up on. When people experience or find something they like they would like to try it. Cooking Is like a talent where people like to enjoy cooking like the cheifs they make really good food. Makeup is fun to do and it is really amazing when people are a makeup artist and really good at fashion. Playing the violin Is hard at first but when people practice and they want to be talented It gets easy.    ",0
"What would you do if you were confused? Sometimes, you are in a hard spot and you have no idea what to do. We have all been their. I think it would be best if you asked different people for their opinions. Seeking for multiple peoples' advice is a benefit because you'll hear different parts of the situation, you could hear form an expert, and you will be more of an extroverted person.

First, you will be able to hear many different sides of the story. This is amazing because you will hear from so many different peoples' opinions, if you have more opinions you will have a better understanding of the topic. Who does not want to hear from different peoples opinions? Also, it would be cool if we could hear different sides of the story. Those are my reasons why it's good to hear many different sides of the situation.

Next, you can hear form an expert. There are many type of experts, and I think that you could find an expert on your topic. Plus, when you hear from an expert you will be more informed and know a lot more than you did. With the expert you could list pros and cons. These people know a lot about the our situation and could help us a lot. Those are a few from many reason for it to be good when hear from an expert.

Lastly, you will more of an extroverted person. The main thing is that you are always socializing, so it will be a lot easier to talk to people. Which is so cool because if you are always asking people for their opinions you will not be afraid to ask people for help, that is something a lot of teens need to learn how to do. Who does not want to talk to other people? Something else is that you will become more of a nicer because you will be learning some social skills. This is the reason why you will become more of a extroverted person.

Asking multiple people for their advice is good because you will hear from different type of people, you can hear from an expert, and you will be a lot more sociable person. If you are ever lost, even just a little, I want you to ask someone for their opinion. It might be hard but it will be worth it. I promise. I would probably ask all my friends for their opinions.",0
"In our society today, limiting car usage would be the best way to go. There are plenty of advantages to limiting car usage, with a decrease in pollution just to name one of them. If we can capitalize on the downward shift of automobile users in the United States and around the world, then it would benefit all of us in more ways then one.

Having a car can be handy to get from point A to point B, but what if you just do not need to use that car at all? What if you are just to lazy to walk or bike to your destination? I am not saying you should walk 80 miles to your aunt's house, but what if it was just to the store that was a half of a mile away. Not to mention that you would be saving good on gas money. There is a mostly car free suburb, for example, in Germany that focuses on a majority of the population of the neighborhood to not use cars. This town is named Vauban, and 70 percent of families do not own a car here. It may sound bad to those who live and die by their car, but with everything in walking distance it makes it easy and accessible to walk from point A to point B most of the time. The residents of this suburb are positive about this change, and they should be, because it is a positive change.

One very large problem with the excessive use of cars in one area is air pollution. Lots of cars in the same area commuting can create a thick layer of smoke in the air called smog, and it is not pleasant to experience on the road. That being said, Paris had recently gotten so much smog in the air that it had to put down a partial ban, license plates with even numbers could not drive on Monday, while odd numbered plates could not drive on Tuesday. It sounds crazy, how could such a busy city like Paris realistically put down a travel ban on half of the commuters? Whether you thought it would or not, it worked. Sure there were a couple of motorists who could not take no for an answer and still commuted when they were not suppose to, but a large majority followed the rules of this ban. Apparently the French government underestimated the factor these cars had on the environment, as the ban was recinded early on Tuesday for the pollution almost completely cleared away.

In support of those two points, the amount of drivers every year has been going down since its peak point in 2005. The gap is nearly nine percent, almost a tenth of the United States has stopped driving in the last 10 years. With this pattern taking place, scientists believe that it will only have postive benefits for the environment and the communities in the forseeable future. The United States is one of the most polluted countries in the world, which in large part is because of our advanced and highly populated culture. That doesnt mean we cant make a difference and help our community grow into a better place environmentally. One good example of that happening is the car free day in Bogota. In this city millions of people got around without using cars and have been since 1995 in this program. It has led to the blooming of brand new parks and repaved, smoother sidewalks. If millions of Colombians can make their community a better place in a heavily populated area, so should we.

To summarize, plenty of places around the world are making good efforts to tone down on car usage. This helps bring down levels of air pollution, enhance the community that those people live in and help their financial situations by saving money on buying a car. If we in America can make these kind of efforts to decrease car usage, our whole country would be better for it in more ways than one.",0
"We should keep the electoral college because. It will allow votes to have a certainty of outcome, Requires a trans-regional appeal, and finaly to avoid run-off elections. This list will be baised on reasons and facts that i think will be sutible for my reason you may have your own facts and opinions but remember anyone can say what they think so this is what i think. Now let us begin.

First off i want to start with on how it will allow votes to have a certainty of outcome. In the source 3: in defense of the electoral college: five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president by:  Richard A. Ponser he talks about that a dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible-it happened in 2000-but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the electoral college invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. Also he talks about winner-take-all basis, and that even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in the state. From what i understand is that electoral college helps create a winner-take-all basis.

Second i would love to disscuse how it requires a trans-regional appeal. In source 3 he talks about how the electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (south, northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite such as Romney was in the south, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful",0
"while asking multiple people is sometimes be confusing and overwhelming however asking multiple people can often expand your understanding an a sertin topic or question and it may also help you make the right diseshin imagine your at game stop and you want to get the call of duty or minecraft for your xbox 360 but only have enough money for one of the game's. you can not decide which one to get so you ask three of the people around you and the first says minecraft the second says call of duty and the third says minecraft and since minecraft is the more popular game you got, however if you only ask the second one then you'd be playing call of duty alone in your basement.

asking more than one person can gives more than one perspective on whatever matters you seek, but be careful of who you ask some people will have different answers. however the people of which you ask may have or knew someone who went through the same problem and the can share there experiences of there problem and how they solved it. by asking more than one person will give you more than one way to solve your problem .

so in conclusion asking more than one person can better your own disshin making process it also may help effect lots of things about you but will still give you the answer you want and need .",0
"To whom this may concern,

The ""winner takes all"" system we've been using doesn't work. Less power is essentially being given to the people, and, some are even being ignored.

In cases such as Al Gore's, the people said yes, and the College said no. And, voters didn't like this. According to a Gallup poll in 2000, after Al Gore lost the race, ""over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"", meaning, Mr. Senator, it's time for change. In addition, this system easily allows for a tie. In this event, the results of the race would be decided by the House of Representatives, which we all know would swiftly put in a vote for the Republican canidate. And, since the Senate has also been recently dominated by Republicans, they too would choose one of their own, resulting in two branches of the government dominated by one political party.

Moreover, with this faulty system, many people are being ignored. As you may recall (or not), ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the canidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad.""(Source 2, Paragraph 13) [(Although not seeing the ads might not have been a bad thing. (I'm just kidding.)] Why is this important? Because the people need to see and meet their canidates, but due to the electoral collage, people are being ignored. If the majority of the votes are known to be going to one canidate or the other, they will most likely not be visited by either side, because whom that state's electoral votes are going to are essentially locked in. The only states that recieve any attention are the ""Swing states"" (Source 2, Paragraph 13) that are pretty equal on both sides and can be easily swayed to pick one canidate or the other.

The only evidence to refute my claim would be that ""Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of proportional representation"" (Source 1, Paragraph 7), which actually might work; however, this would require all the states to change their policies, which we all know won't happen very easily.

So, in summary, Mr. Senator, the way things work is going to need to change, we are being ignored and elections are being thrown. If you don't help us change this, the power of electing the president is going to remain with our, faulty, college.

I hope you consider this,

"The use of technology for facial expressions of students would be very useful beacsue the teacher can tell if a student does not like the lesson or is bored. The computers could tell how students feel towards the class to see if they are enjoying the class or not. If the computers can read facial expressions they could help make the lessons better for the students and maybe they will actually learn something useful. The use of technolgy to read emotions and expressions of students in a class room is a great idea becasue it could help give teachers a better way to teach the students.

In todays world technolgy is very useful and a face scanning system to tell emotions would be a great thing to have. With something like this you could tell how someone is feeling without even talking to them. The face scanning application could however get things wrong and make the wrong asuption of how someone is feeling. The face scanning application could work to help people undertand how someone if feeling but could be very wrong at the same time.",0
"For technology to be able to read the emotional expressions of students would be very beneficial . Some students could struggle with verbally expressing their emotion's making it hard for their teacher/learning coach to know the most successful way to teach them. Therefore if the student starts to get bored, anxious, or confused the computer could pick up on those emotions and make changes to the student's learning lesson to help get them back to focus and engage with their learning . ''A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, ""Dr. Huang predicts. ''Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. ''

Mental illness is on a rise amongst people in general, Students suffer from it too they're not indestructable or working machinces.

Technology being able to read emotional expressions of students is very valuable it could help students to feel less stressed when working on a lesson they struggle with , without the panicky feeling of having to talk to the teacher about it infront of the class which could cause anxiety . With a majority of communication being nonverbal it can be hard to understand even for humans , technology being able to pick up on it would be alot easier and not feel as intrusive as the student having to explain themselve to the teacher/learning coach. ''Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,'' notes Dr. Huang. ''So computers need to understand that, too''.",0
"Do you believe in aliens? Some people say to have evidence and proof that aliens are real. Today I will talk about a particular piece of evidence people are said to have, ''The Face on Mars.''

''The Face on Mars'' is a natural landform found on mars that resembles a human head, but people belive it's an alien landmark. ''The Face on Mars'' is a landform and not an alien because, in the images in the beginning it looks like a head but as technology developed over time and they were able to get clearer pictures it looks more like a landform.

''The Face on Mars is a landform. I say this because if you look at the beginning pictures it looks like a human face, but towards the end it starts to look more like a landform. In the middle of the article it starts to talk about how in the beginning it look liked a face, but the article states, ''April fifth nineteen ninety eight when Mars Globlal Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper then the orginal Viking photos. ''That is proof that back then their cameras weren't as developed and that in nineteen ninety eight there technolgy wasn't perfect, but able to get clearer pictures to prove it was a landform.

In conclusion, ''The Face on Mars'' is a landform and not an alien landmark because in the images you can see at the beginning it may have looked like a face but towards the end of the pictures it looks more like a landform than a face. When you look at the pictures, I believe that in the beginning I would have believe it was an alien landmark because it does look ike a face. As we see in the pictures it does start to look more like a landform because there technolgy develops so they can get a more clearer picture.",0
"Setting examples by your own behavior to influence other people is better for many reasons but still has its pros and cons.

My first reason why is because the majority people around world learn and comprehend better when they have an example in front them. In addition it is easier to influence others by your behavior becuase you experience it everyday and it would be very easy to set an example.

My second reason is setting examples makes you a leader and when other people start to notice it they will strive to act upon that action because they where influenced and want to become a leader like you,soon more and more people will start doing it.

There is only one con and that is depending on the individual and situation that person might not be good at making self behavior examples because they may have not experienced it before but there is a solution for this problem. You can ask a smart adult and act upon there actions and carry it on. Nobody is perfect and its okay to ask for help sometimes.

In conclusion setting examples by your own behavior to influence others is a smart thing to do and you'll be surprised by how many people youv'e influenced.             ",0
"The use of technology to determine the emotional expression of students in a classroom is not valuable. I personally do not think that a computer can analyze a human face and determine in percentages what their emotions are. A human can not be 2% angry and 75% happy. A computer can only determine what looks like on the outside, but not in the inside.

We humans can guess by looking at someone if they are upset, furious, meloncholoy, or estatic. Humans can determine that by their body character or their facial expressions. We cry when we are angry, sad, or happy. A computer could not know that. We ask how they're feeling and most of the time humans can lie about their emotions. They tend to hide them within a smile or a laugh. People may look angry, but that's their natural face expressions. In a room full of students, you are going to get many different emotions depending on what time it is during the day. If it's the morning, students will most likely be tired or sleepy. If it's around noon they may be hungry. During the afternoon students will most likely to be ready to leave school. The time of day can have a mega impact on a person's mood.

A computer may have an estimated guess on a person's mood, but it will never determine it. Us humans are special. We have many different ways we express emotion. We may feel many emotions at the same time, but a computer system could not determine that. We change how we feel all the time. We may not express it either. The FACS system may mistake our emotions through one picture. They could see a picture of you crying and decided that your sad, but in reality you're crying of laughter. In my opinion, you can not decide the expression of Mona Lisa just by looking at one painting. If they had a document saying she was happy most of the time her portrait was painted, then would believe it. Since they don't, I don't believe in anything FACS has documented.

The use of technology can not determine ones emotion(s). Only we can decide on what we feel or how others feel. I strongly believe that we are the only ones who can see emotion.",0
"Hey people of America do yall agree or disagree with me? I think changing to election by popular vote should chose the president of the united states. Because electoral collage are not always one hundred percent right,also the electoral college dont vote for a president but they vote for a slate of electors,and my last reason is that the electoral college might nominate a bad president for the United States of America.

To start my argument off is that my first reason is that the electoral collage is not always a humdred percent right and we might end up with someone we dont want. for example say if Jhon Snipes is running for president and he has a bad criminal record and he only got twenty percent of the votes and the other canidate had the majority of the vote and Jhon Snipes won. He would probley turn the United Sates into a war zone. See this is the main reason why want someone president and barley no one voted for him os her

Another reason is that the electoral collage dont vote for president they vote for slate of electors. This is bad because slate of electors dont speak for everyone. They might like someone that we dont like and give them the power to run for president and probabley win. so this was another reason why the preseident election shouldnt be picked on the electoral collage.

My last reason is that us the people of the United States of America do not want no scum bag of a president that does nothing what so ever to our country. We want a president that is smart and will take care of tha United State, we want a president that will make us feel safe with the decision that he makes, and finally we want a president that we can believe in and that we trust in.

"We all know how important safety is and I personality believe that people should not operate any type of vehicle while using your cell phone.

There has been plenty of accidents caused by texting and driving as well as being on your phone while operating a machine at work. It is always important to keep in mind the safety of others as well as your own. Driving while texting is a major cause of fatal accidents leading up to death.

Its always good to make sure that your very careful when driving and to look all directions while driving so you don't hit anyone and so you don't get hit as well. NOTHING is more important then your life or anyone's life. There for I believe that drivers should not operate any type of vehicle while being on their phones.

Texting while driving could not only take someone's life but it can also get you into trouble with the law. Lot of states have made it illegal to be on your phone while driving. For example in the state of Georgia cell phones are prohibited. The consequences of using your phone while driving would be a fine of 50 dollars as well a 1 point assessed against the drivers license.

Other reasons why being on the phone while driving is bad is because it is distracting and there is a high risk of car crashes.

There is also a high chance to be at fault for an accident if there was ever one to occur.

These are all reasons why I believe drivers shouldn't be allowed to use their cell phones while using or operating a vehicle.",0

"Dear, State Senator

I have recently read articles about the electoral vote system currently in place in the united states.

The electoral vote system elects other people, called electors, to vote for the people.  They basically vote for president, if you and many others vote for him/her.  I believe the electoral vote system is glitchy, outdated, and confusing to some.

The electoral vote system can be manipulated and unfair.  The electors can be choosen by state conventions, state central committees, and the candidates running for president.  If the president can choose his electors, could'nt he replace the orignal electors for new ones that will guarantee a vote for him.  The peoples vote would'nt matter.  This situation happened in the two-thousand election when George W. Bush won the election with more indivisual votes than electoral votes.  This violates our constitution which states, the government is controlled by the people and allows for change if enough people in the US want it.  If you've ever noticed that during the presidential election, candidates don't come to certain states.  In the electoral system, each state has a winner-take-all system.  When the state goes over their electoral votes, the winner with the most electoral votes takes all of them, while the electoral votes of the opponent gets no votes toward him.  This can cause mayhem, the non-counted votes can make a big diffrence in the election.  In nineteen-seventy six their would have been a tie if 9,246 voters in Hawaii and Ohio voted the opposing side.  The elections come close and without the popular vote which accounts for millions of people in America, we may have had better elections with less debates.  The electoral college contains 538 electors, out of those 538 their only 270 are mandatory to vote.  Each elector equals each member in your states House Of Represenatives and add two for the senate.  California has a population of 35 million and wyoming has a population of 500,000.  Wyoming having 5 electors and california having 55.  This doese'nt make sense because if a state may have a higher population than wyoming but yet still have less electors.  The system is very confusing in these ways causing some to vote for the wrong candidate and others thinking they are voting for the right candidate they believe is true .

The electoral votes are'nt the worst because we are still showing our democracy, showing off Americas greatnest in its government.  The electoral vote crisis in two-thousand rarely happens.  This situation has'nt happened since eightteen-eighty eight, its a rare occurance.  Electoral votes also make the playing field even.  If we had popular votes in place, then wouldnt the presidents have a landslide if they went to all the biggest populated states.  The electoral votes can allow ties and close elections to happen instead of land slides in many elections.

The electoral votes should be replaced.  Even so they even out the playing field and the occurence of rigged electoral votes happen, it still doese'nt make up for the both elections lost in eightteen-eighty eight and two thousand.  If we dont change the electoral votes soon, the occurance of electoral vote sabotage will occur more often causing an unfair government to be in place.",0
"The advantages of limited car usage is critical in source 1, Vauban, Germany a place where most of the streets are ""car-free"". In this place car ownership is allowed, but their are only about one or two places to park, which are garages at the end of each development. Limiting car usage has its advantages, the United States has up to 50 percent of greenhouse emissions in some car-intensive areas. Stores are usually placed in malls along some distant highway. The new approach made it so that stores are placed a walk away, you wont have to use more money for gas.

Paris on the other hand bans driving to clear the air of pollution. Car traffic in France was down 60 percent because of the continous smog the same smog that rivaled Beijing, China. According to source 3, ""the day without cars"" campaign has improved the place, parks and sport centers with smooth sidewalks, parks that bloom throughout the cities, and even traffic cutting down dramatically.

The United States rate of ownersip of cars per household in source 4 per person decreases, and so does the greenhouse gas emissions, the emissions take a major curb as the car usage gets limited. Actions in which private cars, bicycles, commercial and public transportation traffic become more limited and can seriously save time, lower emission, and even better, improve safety among the community.",0
"The Dissapearene of the Electroral College

The United States of America has come a long with in regards to its legal system. For example, the new laws that are currently being added to allow gay couples to marry. That shows true progress, however there are other laws that we have, which simply are not needed anymore and are quite outdated. An example of this would be the Electoral College. The system that it abides by is horrendous and unjust. In the eyes of many the Electoral College should be removed from the law and will make Democratic decisions within this country much better.

Now there are quite a few well known people who believe that the Electoral College should be abolished. These people include Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter,and Bob Dole just to name a few. One of the biggest controversial events that had to do with a failure of the Electoral College was the election of 2000. In this situation Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the precidency due to the methods of the Electoral College. It all seems to just be an irrational method as well as a waste of time. This is to be believed because you have citizen voters who add up to the popular vote, yet afterwards it is then turned over to the electors who may be unfair and corrupted. The votes would be much simpler and much more fair if it was a direct popular vote. Not to mention that over sixty perecent of voters whould prefer a direct election as oppossed to the method of voting we have now.

(Source 2, Brad Plumer)

The way that the Electoral College works is selection of electors, then a meeting of electors where they vote for the President and Vice President, and finally the elctoral votes are counted by Congress. All thats done is adding a middleman who makes a decision for the people who spent their time to vote for the candidates they elected. Also with this ""winner-take-all system

(Source 1, The Office of Federal Register)

it leaves those who ""chose wrong"" left with nothing, however let it be noted that in Maine and Nebraska there is a variation of ""proportional representation"". Finally, after the election the governer of your state prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" which lists all the candidates who had run for President in your stae as well as a list of the representing electors.

Along the lines of voting not only do voters practically have no say in who they are voting for due to basically voting for representing electors thus its up to the electors to vote for a President and Vice President, not the people of this nation. For example, if you lived in Texas and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you would end up voting for a slate of thirty four Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. With the very small chance that the electors won the statewide election kept in mind, they would then have to go to Congress and as a result Kerry would have thirty four more electoral votes. To be honest this whole system seems to be rediculously unnecessary and tedious. As said beofre a direct method of voting from the citizens would be more beneficial to the whole nation. In the end, that is one of the most important things to keep in mind because that is what will end up being affected the most which is the entireiety of the U.S.A.

Lets not forget that in this whle voting via the Electoral College, there is a very apparent disaster factor looming above their heads. When you put it into context that a candidate that a majority of the population of voters appealed to and voted for did not end up being elected because of the choices of the electors theres going to be a huge problem as a result. Not to mention the fact that many are afriad of the chance that there will eventually be a situtaion where there is a tie. Furthermore, this can also be taken into account in a vice versa manner because if there is a candidate that lost the popular vote but won the votes of the electors there will be ridiculous amounts of uproar to follow. In the close there are just too many comlexities and problems that follow the Electoral College and it would be for the benefit of all if it was abolished.",0

Well at a young age you might have a fantacy and a very huge immagination well at least i did, as a kid this could help because if you commit to a career at young age. When you're older you'll be an expert and know the job by memory. Having to commit to a career at a young age can save you time in the future, when you have graduated you would automatically have a option and know what job you are going to do. This can also be a terrible idea because at that a young age you don't really know what you want as a career, you just go with what ever your parents or the person you look up to does and as you get older you relize you were not really into that career. Your brain also isn't fully developed until you're older it is a proven fact.

Having a fantacy and a very great immagination is good because it can motivate you to choose a good carreer which you would obviosly enjoy in the future. May aslo be a bad idea because when you get older you learn to hate things you enjoyed as a kid and it would just leave you with a career you cant enjoy as much as you use too. For example when i was a kid i enjoyed to play Football i always thought i would do it until i died. As i got older i began to hate it, because it wasn't really what i wanted to do it was what my dad wanted me to do which i enjoyed because it made him happy. Now i know i want to travel the world and be a Photographer and learned to speak up for myself and it helped me to communicate with my dad and be straight forward with him there for kids are confused at a young age.

Reasons why commiting to a career at a young age is a good idea. The more you get older the more you know about the job so you'll be a wealthy man getting paid good by the time you are twenty five. There for you wouldn't be worried and freaking out about what career you are going to do after school you would already be prepared mentally and physically.

As a kid you enjoy whatever your parents are doing, so you would obviously choose a career to be with your parents and thats a good thing as a kid. It'll make the job easier, funnier and more comftorable.

""In some societies, students are expectected to identify a career by the time they enter high school."" Personally i think Choosing a career at a young age is a bad idea, because like i said it is a proven fact that your brain isn't fully developed at a young age. That can be a bad idea to choose a career at a young age because you can choose a career you know nothing about, which means once you learn the job you might not even like it as much as when you first chose it. For example let's say Your father could be working as a construction worker and because he does it you might chose your career to be a construction worker. When kids are young they like what others like its just how society makes you think, as you get older you become wiser and realize thats not what you actually want to do. There for you should not choose a career when you are in high school and just enjoy your school year's once you graduate you'll regret it and wish you had just relaxed but that does not mean you should'nt plan for upcoming careers you should have more than one option, prepared for after you graduate.

"Places around the world such as Germany, America, Paris, and Columbia are all contributing to reduce the use of cars to help make the Earth a better place. In German they dont allow cars exept to be parked in a large garage (along with a $40,000 fine) so people can transport without using a car. Paris bans the use of cars to prevent smog which was indeed a problem there. In Bogota, Columbia, they pitch in to help by hosting a car-free day every year, once a year leaving people the options to hike, bike, skate, or take a bus promoting the use of excersize. Advantages to limiting car usage is reducing people from having stress and tensadity and saving the Earth from pollution and smog. Saving people from stress can be helped by the vancansy on the roads, things that limited car usage can provide. Limited car usage can also help contribute to the absence of air pollution and smog and saving your money.

""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" retorted Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two. She, Heidrun Walter, along with others is thankful for the ban of cars because the ban reduces stress and tensity. Buisnessman Carlos Arturo Plaza can second this statement and does by stating ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress..."". With the absence of traffic jams stress can most definitely be altered to a place of no stress and car-free day can leave the streets devoided of traffic jams, according to Andrew Selsky. Stress can drive someone crazy and it's in everyone's best interest that we, as residants of the world, try and stop the things that can cause stress. Some may argue that not having a car is stressful, but having stress over the presence of traffic jams can over see any other kind of stress to be thought of. Heidren Walker and Andrew Selsky can both support that argument that having a car is a lead to stress that a reduction of cars can elimanate. Tensity and stress aren't the only upsides to a limitation on cars.

Are you tired of not being able to see bevause of smog and having bad particles in the air? Limitation can take away these issues! Paris can definitly be one to complain because in Robert Duffer's article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" they had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter (a little over Brussels counts and almost twice as the amount in Londons). Bogota is also struggling with the presence of smog and are in hopes to anialate the smog by having a car-free day. Car-free day also helps make the air pollution vanquish. Carlos Arturo Plaza gives his opinion by commenting ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Limitating how much you use your car can greatly help places around the world and help your own body.

Almost 4,000 drivers were fined because they chose to invalidate the regulation of not using their car according to Robert Duffer. Is it worth paying the prices? Using your cars overly or when you shouldn't is like throwing away food when you're hungry. It does no good and gets you in a messed up situation. In German suburbs people had to pay a price of $40,000 to pay for a spot to park their car. Is it worth it? People who drove on car-free day had to pay fines of $25. Is it worth it? So much money is down right wasted because of the use of cars so why go down the road of empty pockets? It's not worth it. Save money and live better by not throwing your money down the drain.

Places around our world is promoting limiting car use in places like Germany, America, Paris, and Columbia. Germany and Paris are both bannings cars and Columbia is having a car-free day. Making sure we dont over use our cars can help with saving ourselves from stress, saving ourselves from smog and air pollutants, and saving ourselves from an empty wallet. There are so many advantges to limiting our use on how much we drive cars so do yourself a favor, save money, save your sight, get rid of stress and watch those miles!",0
"The number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005. From there, it steadily dropped to, as of April 2013, nine percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. This decrease has had positive effects, though. Limiting car usage saves time, improves safety, conserves resources, and causes more social interactions with people.

Recent studies suggest the Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. Still, in places like paris, cars are still causing pollution. After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday, motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine. The same would apply to oddnumbered plates the following day. Because of this ban, congestion went dow 60 percent in the capital of France. By having fewer cars out on the streets, it lowers rates of traffic and the time it takes people to get to work. Also, in result of a decrease in traffic, there would be less accidents and less lives lost to motorvehicle collisions.

France's tax policy that favors diesel fuel over gasoline results in higher percent of people using diesel vehicles. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe. By cutting back on car usage, the world would save an astronomical amount of resources. If people stopped buying cars, there would be less production of them. Thus conserving the metal, as well as other materials, used to make the cars.

""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdent streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor. Sitting in a car to get to work, or any where in fact, restricts how much interaction you have with other people. By walking, or even taking public transportation, you get the chance to run into people you know or meet new people.

Time saving, improvement on safety, conservation of resources, and more social facetoface interactions can be accomplished by limting car usage. The decrease in the percentage of miles driven in the United States from 2005 to 2013 proves that people are starting to understand this. If the pattern persistsand many sociologists believe it willit will have benificial implications for carbon emissions and the enviornment as well.",0
"Venus is a planet in space, that is the second planet from the sun and the closest plant to Earth density and size wise. Venus has a ""thick atmosphere of almost 97 carbon dioxide"" which makes it a very toxic place and top of the ""clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere."" Other dangerous conditions are such as the temperatures that ""average 800 degrees Fahrenheit.""

The author suggets that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it presents. It is a worthy pursuit because researchers can explore new types of rocks, gas, and etc. Because Venus is such as harsh planet, it makes everything on the planet that much rare. Despite the conditions, when things on the planet are discovered it can make a huge impact on the history of space and scientists.

""NASA's possible soultion to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float ablove fray."" The author presents an idea that would allow humans to be able to observe the planet despite the dangers it presents.",0
"Cars have been a necessity to us for as long as I can remember. Billions of people around the world use cars everyday. Without cars in our lives many people would be lost and not know what to do. Thinking of a world without cars is unreasonable to the people of today, but if they thought of all the good not driving everyday does for the world then it would probably be a different story.

Many places are enforcing people to go without there cars transporting them everyday, which could be a good thing. Heidrun Walter a man in source 1 states, ""Seventy percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and fifty-seven percent sold a car to move here."" By saying this he is showing how many people like living their lives without all the troubles cars can cause. People of this community dont have to worry about being ran over by cars or being stuck in traffic everyday. David Goldberg, another man in source 1 also states, ""All of our development since World War two has been centered on the car, and that will have to change."" In saying this he portraying that we need to focus on more important things and stop worrying about cars, which hurt us more in the long run than they do helping us.

Vauban isn't the only place that has enforced the rule of not using cars. Many other places have done so also. Robert Duffer states, ""After days of near-record pollution, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" By saying this the author is explaining how the use of cars have dramatically polluted a city. Just think, if there were no cars, then there would be less pollution to worry about hurting all the city's. It is not hard to ride a bike to the places you need or want to go. Instead of using cars everyday and hurting our enviroment, people should think of how much good they would be doing and money they would be saving by taking another type of transportation than just cars.

Bogota, Colombia has also taken the no car use into affect. They have used many other types of transportion such as hiking, biking, and even skating to there destination. Businessman Carlos Arturo from source 3 says, ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" He and many other citizens of this place agree with saving our enviroment and not using cars. Not using cars is less stressful because your not consistently worring about gas, the car breaking, or getting into an accident with another driver.

Just imagine your life without using a car everday. Not using a car isn't that bad and doesnt hurt you or the people around you as much as it does having one. Using a car everyday puts your life at risk, takes your money, and hurts the enviroment. Life without cars would be simpler and less stressful in our world today.",0
"This all started 21 years ago. Here is how the face on Mars was discovered. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars, taking pictures for possible landing sites for it's sister Viking 2 and it spotted a shadown of a likely human face. It was a great big head shaped face 2 miles apart from end to end. That is how this all started.

How could aliens make such a thing? There is no way. Some scientist believe that the face was an alien artifact, the photographing from Cydonia became a priorty for NASA when MGS showed up at the Red Planet in Sepmber. The face was not created by some things we like to call aliens that we don't even know if they exist or not, kind of like mermiads or unicorns.

There is to much evidence of how this face could of formed on it's own. It was so bi it would take aliens so long to even make this thing we say that looks like a face. Some people belive that the face is ""bona fide"", which means that that face is evidence that there was life on Mars at one point. Nobody has that big of a face for it to be an actual human face. I believe it is just a natual landform that just happened to look a lot like a human face. The face is exactly located 41 degrees North martian latitude where it was winter in April '98, a very cloudy time on the Red Planet. This investigation the scientist haas said has been very hard work to figure out exaclty what it is. I still belive with all the evidence we have it has to just be God's creation and it just apeared to look like a face, no aliens or anything like that because if you want to tell me that aliens did it you better be showing me that aliens even exist first.",0
"In the article "" Unmasking the Face on Mars"", there has been an argument about whether or whether not it is a natural landform. Some people suggest that it was formed by alien life on Mars and some people believe that it is a natrual landform. I believe it is a natural landform because of what the scientists have found.

The text states, ...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Not only was the Face formed but it was also and illusion. The text also states, ""...snapped a picture ten time sharper than the original Viking photos...revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" The scientists had taken a better picture after they viewed it again proving it was a natural landform. Lastly, although not everyone was satisfied, the scientists had stated, "" It's not easy to target Cydonia...In fact, it's hard work."" This shows that just because the supposed ""alien markings"" were hidden by clouds or haze, doesn't mean they are alien markings. The text states, "" It's not easy to target Cydonia...In fact, It's hard work..."" So to prove that the "" alien markings"" was just a natural landform, scientists took a second look and captured the best photo they have and proved that is was just a butte or a mesa which were "" common landforms around the American West."" This evidence shows that is is a natural landform that is an equivalent to America's common landforms.

I believe that it is a natural landform because of what scientists have found. Scientists have taken pictures and second looks of those pictures to prove that the Face isn't ""alien markings"", but a natural landform. All this evidence proves that the Face is a natural landform and while my evidence shows something else, there could be evidence that shows it is alien markings. So what is your view on the Face?",0
"While the Face on Mars does look like a face, there is no way possible that it could be an alien artifact. Research, advance in technology, quotes from scientists, and actual evidence proves that this is just a natural landform on Mars. Mars has had plenty of speculation on this, yet all the answers have come back that it is impossible. No, there is not a lot of evidence, but there is enough to show that this is just a mesa.

When scientist first found the Face, it was already speculated to be a mesa. This was because of the place where it was located, Cydonia. Cydonia is known for having many mesas in its area. This one just happened to have shadows on it appearing like a face. Let us not forget that the Face was found in 1978. That is when space travel was still a new for the world. Technology was not that advanced as it is today. The last picture was taken in 2001, which was twenty years later after the first photograph was taken. Spacecraft and photos had improved twice as much.

Even though technology has improved we still cannot tell whether it is an alien or not. We must go off of facts. Scientist Jim Garvin stated that,""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, id there were objects in the picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could not see what they were!"" This shows that the Face could not even of been seen. So, it is impossible that it was an alien artifact.

Mesas and buttes are very common on Mars. Especially in Cydonia. Technology has improved and there is no way we could see a face from that size. ""That's a lave dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face of Mars,"" said Garvin. Research and results have proven that the Face is just a landform like any other on earth.",0
"It's been a large debate on if the Face in Mars is a natural landform. I believe the Face in Mars is a natural landform from natural disasters happening on Mars. One thing that leads me to believe that the Face on Mars is a natural landform is when it says in paragraph 7 ""Thosands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.""

So, proof was also given that the mysterious Face on Mars was a natural landform. In paragraph 11 it states that objects were found in the picture such as airplains, Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks. This leads me to believe that all the objects are also causes of this natural landform on Mars because objects like these may leave marks, or spots and ect. Lastly, what led me to believe that the Face on Mars is a natural landfrom is paragrapgh 12 saying ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West."" This says that the Face is way to large to be a human face or alien. in conclusion, the Face on Mars is a natural landform because there was proof that it is, objects were found on the picture making spots, marks and ect., and that the face is way to big to be a human's face or alien's.",0
"The Challenges of Exploring Venus is highley dangerous to land and to live on. Its sometimes called the ""Evening Star"". Its the brightest points of light in the night sky. in our solar system Venus is the second planet from our sun. Humans have sent numerous meaning lots of aircrafts to land on Venus. Since there not been a successful space air craft that survived the landing for than a few hours. issues explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Venus's reputation as a challenging plant for humans to study. The planet's surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit.

Venus is a hard planet to explore on giving the fact that its 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The Solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not exceed on Earth levels. Temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit. Most importantly researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Many of our researchers are working on making innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus. Other studies show that NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted up to at least three weeks in such conditions. By comparison systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure and heat and in all other forces.

""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" would take more than a few years for our researchers to figurer a way to collect the data from the planet. NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. Venus has value not because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself. But also because of human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doughts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.",0
"The studying of Venus is a worthy persuit despite its dangers. Theres is many good thing to come out of this.

The author states that Earth was once like our planet. In parragraph 4 lines 4-10 it states that perhappes Venus was like Earth. by being covered in oceans and could support various life forms. Still today it still has some of these fetures like valleys and craters.

The text also states that they have a unique way that is safe to humans for them to visit Venus. In parragraph 5 NASA has the idea of having a large blimp like structure aporxpmently 30 or so miles above Venus to test. all though it would be hot it would not be as hot as it would be if they were on the planet so it would be safer. NASA is still challengeing themselfs by figuring out how to collect samples.

In conclusion traveleing would be worth the while despite the dangers. Because we could figure out amazing things that we didnt know yet. and could further educate our world about our universe.",0
"People think that first impressions are almost impossible to change. I disagree with that because impressions is just what you think, always make you think different things, and you never know whats gonna happen.

Impressions is like when you thought somethings, its just what you think about someone or something. For example:My impression is that she is not telling me the truth. you think that she's not telling you the truth but you don't know the truth.

Impressions can make you think different or bad just because how you look at someone or something. For example: If you see someone that has a bad looking, your impression is that he might be poor but, you can change your impression if you see that he has the Iphone of the year, or he has a Lamborghini, so it can make you think different.

When women get pregnant they always get impress and trying to guess what the baby is gonna be. For example: When my mom got pregnant and she had me, her impression was that it was gonna be a girl, and she wanted a girl, but here i am, 18 years old, a big boy and she was impress and sad, but when she see that i was very handsome her impression change she's happy now.

Some people believe that just with their impression you are what they say.

Next time you think that the first impression is impossible to change, you have to think the first impression does not say everything about a person or something.

I hope you never impress by something or someone, that can be different that you thought, thats why we dont judge, God is the only one who can judge.",0
"My first opinion,

would be that to be a good person,

is you have to be your self no matter what is going to happen . For example a good behavior star at home because your parents have the responsibility to educate. Also some people said the students are very bad for other students, like they are bad influence .

My second, reason would be the your own problems can affect, your career. For example your grades at school if you are a good person with other people to be a good citizen just be you because people the just talk never do something good. But sometime teen don't deserve what they have for example school, job, people the they love them.

After that well, if you work that is a good idea because you can focus, and two things but if you are weak that will be a terrible decision . So a good behavior is excellent, because you always can find friends, and maybe a girlfriend but den pent of you.

In conclusion, if you are a good behavior you will be a good person, and the future, and a good guide for you children. Also if you are a good students,you will be have credit for college but you have to be a good behavior. So the mean, that you responsibility is work very hard to complete your goals. And help other people, who need help because the would make you a good behavior.",0
"Dear, State senator Voting is a public thing that happens every fourth year when a President is resining or cannidating for a second run. People all around the United States vote for a President they think can run the country the best. I think it's not fair that our votes are getting thrown away, and not even looked at. bradford Plumer said that ""the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational source 2 paragraph 14, and i think that is true. I think we should Bannish the Electoral College because it is a old process, unfair to Americans, and can lead to disasters.

The Electoral College is a very outdated process. Dont you think we should use a new one? The electoral College has been use since the 13 colonies, and has been ignoring the public ever since. I think its only fair if we have a part in the president election. Also, if we could change it to popular vote, more people would be intact with politics. Bradford Plumer says that ""the election is only a few swing voters away from a catastrophe. source 2 paragraph 12. I agree with him because the Electoral College is very old and can break at any time. I think its time that we change that and start fresh.

America's saying is ""home of the free, land of the brave"" well its not free if we cant vote for our president we want, and the government does it for us. Bradford Plumer says that the electoral college is unfair to voters, and candidates because of the winner takes all system source 2 paragraph 13. The winner takes all system is states choosing if the are going to pick a republican president or demicrate president. Lastly. it is unfair to us. We have no power against the government, and our votes mean nothing to them.

The Electoral College can also lead to disasters! rivets can flood the streets if they dont like the legislators choice, and that can lead to deaths. Secondly, shootings could start to occurring around the states, and can get out of hand. Inicent silvilians can get hurt for no reasons. Lastly, there can be financial crashes, and everyone around the states could go in dept.

to sum up my letter i think the electoral College should be bannished for good. You have heard that it is a old process and can lead to falure, it is unfair to americans, and it can lead to disasters all around the country.",0

Reason two staying in school an extra hour is less time to do our homework and they give out a lot of homework,we will probably be done with homework by bed time. Reason three with more school hours,less homework time,less free time. We wont have any time to do what we want because they give out a lot of homework witch means we have to put in more time on home work and we have to stay in school for an extra hour also means more homework time and way less free time. thats why we should not be in school for an extra hour because we are in school almost all day,less time to do our homework,even less time for free time.

"The electoral college is how presidents get elected. But when people vote for president they do not directly vote. The electoral collge does not work and is irrational. It does not help anyone and can cause a candidate to lose the presidential election. It just does not work anymore.

The electoral college does not work. ""The Indefensible Electoral college: Why even the bestlaid defense of the system are wrong"" By Bradford Plumer says "" The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor"". They are talking about how Al gore got the popular vote yet George bush won. This is a prime example how the electoral college doesn work. The voters were cheated into there win. This just shows how unfair it is. ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defense of the system are wrong"" By Bradford Plumer says ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always."" This basically says it is possible for u to have no input in what u vote for. If your vote does not count then why should u vote. The system doesn work and needs to be tossed. The whole point of americas government is that your voice matters but apparently the electoral collge is free from the rule.

The electoral college is out of date according to the article. ""In defense of the electoral collge : Five reasons to keep our despised method of chhosing the president"", says "" The electoral College is widley regarded as an anachronism, a nondemocratic method of selecting a president out to be Overruled by declaring the candidate who recives the most popular votes the winner"". This article speaks the truth. Being a democratic like america the people rule and if this method is not democractic then off with it. It does not benifit us and will do more harm then good. ""In defense of the electoral collge : Five reasons to keep our despised method of chhosing the president"", says"" The electoral collge avoids the problem of elections in which no candidte recieves a mojority of the votes cast."" But that should be the reason one is elected. If they are most popular than why do they not get the vote. If they did the best campainge they should get the victory.

The electoral college is old and illogical. It is tired and needs to be replaced. AMerica is a new country and americans like new things. Change may not all ways be fun but it may be right. WHy should americans go through this hell anymore. Elctions are you as an individual trying to get the one who you approve into office. This is wjhy the electoral college is old and needs to retire.

"Technology gets a lot of backlash, but in reality it is our friend. Technology empowers and teachus us. Without it, we wouldn't be as informed of the world as we are now. For this reason, advanced technology should continue to be used. Introducing the FACS technology in schools would be valuable because it would create a more beneficial enviornment for everyone: society and individuals alike.

Implementing the Facial Action Coding System into schools would be very valuable for society as a whole. The article states that the software provides the exact emotions of someone. For example, the machine might declare that someone is ""83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry."" (paragraph 1) Teens' actions related to their emotions are still fairly unknown, so having this information on adolescents in particular would help us be able to identify the root of the emotions later on. It's clear that FACS would seriously benefit science.

Perhaps the most important reason for going through with this technology is that people would be more honest with each other at school. Enabling teachers and students alike to see how others are feeling would create a distinct openness in the school. Students would no longer feel that they have to put on a ""happy face,"" (as the article mentions in paragraph 9) when they're sad. There would be no point for this deception, since FACS would see right through it. People who felt sad could be comforted by others. Students would be more happy than they are now, at the end of a long school day. Having the FACS technology in schools would create an enviornment of honesty and happiness.

It's true that having a machine see right through you would take some getting used to. But this unsettling feeling is overcome by the fact that this technology benefits science and our enviornments in a huge way. It makes us into a better people, so the question is, why would we not go through with it?",0
"Do you agree with Churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success? If the statement about the role that failure plays in the pursuit of success, it could help people to do better things. People can have a better future. Also people can feel more positive.

First, people can do better things. For example, my cousin Generic_Name had a soccer game at Generic_City, she and her team was talking about how they will need to play on the field, they needed to play better than the other games because the team that she was going to play against is one of the best teams that plays on that field and also her team needed to have more goals scores to keep being on the list so the can win the championship, so when they started to play they was playing like they planned it before the game and at the end of the game they won and everyone was happy because they never thought that they was going to have the chance to win that team, but they never give up.

Next, people can have a better future. For example, my parents after they got married they always wanted to have a better future for them and for all there kids they was going to have, so both of them was planning to cross the board from Mexico to the United States, so after a week they finally cross the board and they was living with my grandma, when my dad started working after a couple of months my dad bought a new house and they started to live there, then they were saving money to buy more stuffs because they was going to need to buy a lot of things like: beds, clothes, shoes, table, chairs, etc. After some years they finally got everything they needed and they had two kids and finally got to know that they will have a better future.

Last, people can feel more positive. For example, when my cousin talk to her coach about that I wanted to be in a team of soccer, the coach called me and told me that he wanted me to play soccer with his team the next weekend, but before that I told him that I was not that good at playing soccer and he told me that I will learn easier and faster if I go to practices, so when I went to my first game I was so nervous about that I was not going to play good as the other girls do, and I did not wanted them feel bad if we lose for my fault, but I kept playing and I never thought that at my first game I was going to make a goal, but overall I kept going from failure to failure and never loss my enthusiasm and that is one of the reasons that helped me feel more positive of myself.

In conclusion, I believe that going to failure to failure will not loss the enthusiasm, at the same time it could be one of the betters reasons by making people do things better, make people have a better future, and also people can feel positive by them self.",0
"I would first remind them that when the face on Mars was first shown in a picture, we did not have the greatest technology. This tells us that we cannot assume any thing in the picture to be definite because things may be blurred. This is not a major point to go on, but it is just the beginning.

Next, I would explain that messas are very common on Mars and that the shadows are the only factor that are actually giving an illusion of a face. This strays from from their belief that the face on Mars was created or planted there.

After that, I would simply point out that clearer pictures and better evidence have proven the face on Mars to be ""a huge rock formation....formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.""

Also, Hollywood has been known to dazzle the mind with some unlikely but fascinating thoughts. Such as the many movies aout the face on Mars pointing the attention to aliens to gain more supporters and the good ratings from the audience. It is basically science fiction. They only provide a perspective from which the human mind can comprehend imagination. Imagining is good, but not with false hope. Books, magazines, and talk shows will do the same thing for similar reasonS. And other propositions from ordinary people for this face on Mars have surely been made over the last twenty-five years.

These things point to the fact that the face is merely a coincidence in a messa formation.",0
"A problem can be good or bad. you can learn from the problem that you made. Sometimes you can't learn from the problem you did. I can agree and disagree with this statement. Not all people can think it can be true because you can do something wrong and get in trouble for it. You can keep doing the same problem and not care for it.

You can choose what your problem's are. You don't need to have a problem to do your best. You can be good at something and not have a problem with it. Some problems are good because you learn from what's good and bad. If you do something that's wrong it's ok. Because doing the right thing can be hard for people to do. Much of the time theirs something you can't do about it.

People choose to take the wrong path for their life and some don't. The ones who take the wrong path will go though a lot trouble. They would have a lot of problem's that they can't change but just cause you that path doesn't mean you change it. Even the ones who are living good doesn't mean their not going though some problems because everyone does.

So what I think it's trying to tell us is would you work out your problems to become the best. You can change one problem that's is stopping you from doing something. That you can change the wrong thing to a good thing. Even if you mest up doesn't mean you are bad. Learn from the problem you did and grow up as you learn form it. Want to be the best you will have to learn whats the best from your mistake's.",0
"Venus is one of three planets that orbit the sun at different times and speeds. Venus has a temperature of 800 degrees ferenheit and the atmospheric pressure is about 90 greater than what we get on Earth. These are the reasons why Venus is worthy despite of all the dangers. From the text "" The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" states that "" Solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not exceed Earth's leves. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans"" (Paragraph 5). So even with the high radiation levels humans can still survive on Venus. In the text it also states "" Some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in the chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and lasted for three weeks in such conditions"" (paragraph 7). To summarize why studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite of how dangerous it is scientist have found and made devices that could help pick up and look for sediments on Venus due to hot it is when standing on it.",0
"The authur supports the ides that studying venus is worthy pursuit because in the stroy the authur says""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms density. They also say in the differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to venus. Astronomers are facinated by venus because it may well once have been the most earth like planet in our solar system because long ago Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life , just like the earth we live in now. also venus planets gots rocky sediment and includes familiar feature like mountains,craters and futhurmore. The Natinal Aeronatautics and Space Administration had an ides of making wants humans to study venus they also want some thing like a jet so they can fly over Venus to fly over many storms and also to look around planet venus.

In the article it says the nasa are working on other approaches to studying venus because how alike this planet. these are the projects that they are working n is silicon carbon, also they have been mechanical computers these devices were first envisioned in the 1800's and played an important role in the 1940's during the world war 11.",0
"How can a facial action coding system can identify a persons initial facial exspretion? Well what it does and how it can be helpful, useful and then it can solv a lot of mystreys in some cases. If somebody can tell what feelings there exspressing can be helpful in a way by telling somebody like a doctors that studys people when there just angry, sad or happy. And that tecnology can help when others are in a certain state of depresion and that certain somebody doesent want to be noticed that machine can help with a person they may commit suicide. When no one knows it but the machiene can tell if there just trying to put on a good face over a really bad time. So then how can it be useful it will also sovle some unusal cases like some artisis make and no one will ever understand what they were trying to go for inside the person. Like the Mona Lisa some people will probably never understand what if just is smiling or grining for the picture. If this invention coms out permanatly that it can show a poll of how kids view homework and then show how some people view work places. If they are dicustuing or just p a place you dont want to goto. Then it also solves the basic stuff like make face detecting how people fell about some presidents andit can solve cases if a person was happy or he was mad to tell if a person was a killer or not. So in conclusion I think it is very useful in my opinon and I hope they make more of these inventions",0
"Is venus worth it? Venus is a plant that is close to Earth. They call it Earths twin its the same density and size. Venus is closer to the sun than Earth is withc can make it dangerous for it to be explored.

In the past they have tried to explore it they have sent numerous spacecraft to land Venus. Each of the missions have been unmanned. Since no spacecraft have even survied the land more that a few hours. This explains why exploring Venus could be a good reason or a bad reason. The passage states that they have been succesful in three decades. It is a very challenging plant for humans to study. The atmosphere makes it even worse to travel through it being 97 persent carbon dioxide. The preasure from it is 90 percent worse even on top of that it can reach up to 800 degrees fahrenheit.

Is the rish worth taking put humans in dnager just to explor the plant even if they are not sure of it. venus has the hotest surface temperaature than any other plant in our solar system. They say astrnomers are fascinated by Venus because its like Earth. NASA

is also working on studying Venus.

They say Venus has value because human curiosity will likely lead into intimidating endeavors. They also say that even though there are dangers here that means that we shouldn't stop what we are doing we keep pushing. They also say beacuse of doubts they shouldn't give up. If a spacecraft can't stay there for more than two hours then how do you explore it with out having risks. This could put people in dnager. They shouldn't go Because of the risks, Some peopel might want to go because of the golory of acheaving that goal for NASA but its just not safe to risk exploring a plant that has bad condictions.

In conclusion exploring a plant with 800 deagrees and 90 percet worse preasure than Earth. A spacecraft has not been able to land there more than two hous you need more than two hours to descover a plant. The risk is huge for exploring Venus. It is also the hotest plant in our atmosphere. They should not travel Venus at all to big of risk and a lot of doughts to even consider going.",0
"Dear Senator of the United States, I am a student in Miami Senior High School and I've been learning a lot about the Electoral College Vote. I know that the Electoral College is a process in the system and it consists of the selection of the electors and you don't want to get rid of it but I've got some reasons why you should remove it.

I've been reading about the Electoral College Vote and I found a passage that is full of details about how the Electoral College is affecting us, the citizens of the United States. The passage, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"", states that, ""thanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" This is trying to say that the citizens don't like the fact that we don't even vote for a president anymore, we just vote for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. The electoral college vote isn't giving us the opportunity to pick a president we want to win and we sometimes even get confused about the electors and the candidate we decide to choose. This makes it really hard for all of us to have the rights of voting.

Also, I found another quote that supports our thoughts, it says, ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" What we're trying to say is that we need a chance in choosing who we want to win in an election. In my opinion, the electoral college vote is unfair to all the voters. Most citizens do agree with what Bob Dole said one day: ""Abolish the electoral college!"" To sum it all up, there are some positive things about the electoral college. In the passage I found called ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" says that, ""Obama received 61. 7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and rodney.."". However, we just want the electoral college vote to be abolished because the citizens would appreciate to have a chance in voting for a president by our opinion. I think that the popular vote is a better way to let us do this because it depends on the voters and who they chose for. This way, it will be equal for all of us.

I would like to thank you for taking your time to read this letter and to think about the thoughts that some of the citizens in the United States have in mind. Your service is appreciated by all of us.",0
"Dear Florida senator,

I would say lets get rid of the electoral college vote the reason is because the voters vote for slate of electors. They really are not letting the people speak their mind about who should really be president. Like it said in the story and I quote""

sometimes the slate of electors might vote for the other side

"". Also it says in the passage that the electoral college vote ""is unfair, outdated, and irrational"". The eletoral college vote is just a waste of time to be honest.

Another reason why I think we should get rid of the electoral college vote is because it really doesn't make any sense to have it. The popularity vote should be the one that counts the reason is because it gives the voters the chance to vote for the president instead of having that eletoral college vote where they can't just easily just vote for the new president. The other thing is that in the electoral college votes it goes by slate of electors well some states have more electors than others like californa and texas all states should have an equal amount of voters instead of just giving the big states the all of the power.

The last reason why I think we should get rid of the electoral college vote is because of the disaster factor. In the year of 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis. In 1960 segregationists in louisiana the lesgislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democrtic electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. the other thing is what if their is a tie between the two. The whole election would be thrown to the house of representitves.

These are all the reasons why I think we should get rid of the electoral college votes because it is more easy doing the popularity vote because it gives the people to speak on who they want to be president.",0
"""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author suggetst that studing Venus is worthy but also dangerous. The author tells us how Venus is ""one of the brightest points of light in the night sky"" and also the second largest plantet with the ""nickname misleading since Venus is actually a planet"". There so many things to learn about when it comes to different planets. It would be worthy to go study more things about plantets so we can know about them and maybe one day lots of people coud go on one of these plants without just being a scientist. The bad thing about is we still don't have the best ways to get there and back saflty.

There is 97 percent of carbon dioxide in Venus and plus more of a challeng is the clouds of highy corrosive and eve 800 degrees Fahrenheit. It makes it a little hard to be able to go on Venus because of all that. ""NASA is working on other approaches to studiying Venus. For example, osme simplified eletronice made of silicaon carbid have been tested in a chamber simulation the chaos of Venus's surface.

stiving ot meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only becasse of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also becasue human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidation endeavors. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded ot meet the very badges of imaination and innovation.",0
"Do you get nagged on for not driving your car or even trying to ride a bike somwewhere because its not convenient for another party? Well these places are doing it to keep people safe and less toxicated and polluted.

Lots of places today are becoming polluted by smog. Which can be limited by not letting people with certain liscense plates drive on certain days or even not allow them to drive for a weeks time. Also making public transportation free for the time being will help them say okay i'll give my car up.

Another reason to give up your cars is because it will cause less accidents less problems and less deaths. Furthermore the counties/states which you live might also recognize you for your perserverance in this act.

Finally the last reason to give up your vehicle is that it will give you less stress from having to repair it from so much use and you wont have to replace it so often. Another reason is because it will save you money and you definetly want more money right who doesnt. you also might get more dates because they see you as a more conservative person so there is your best reason.

In conclusion, taking cars off the road for cetain days or even a week at a time may give you less smog more money and less stress. In the long run you might also score a girlfriend that you might soon marry and have a much happier life in general.",0
"Schools are places where kids end up spending the majority of their childhood in. Most kids end up disliking school for one reason or another, while others might love school. To have the ability to know how a child is feeling and map their patters can become useful in more ways than one. The use of reading a students emotions is valuable in many ways like helping with possible depression, enhancing the material, and creating a better enviroment.

School can be a stressful time for many students and also a time of growth. Especially in high school and even middle school, the childs body is going through puberty. This chemical change in the body can lead to mood swings and other issues especially when school stress is added on top. This technology is capable of indicating ""...the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one""(paragraph 7). With the aid of this technology the school can help students before they develope mental illnesses like depression that often go unseen due to hiding true emotion.

Also, in many schools students usually find the learning material to be sub par or boring in many cases. However with the aid of this technology ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" (paragraph 6). If a teacher was able to pin point when exactly a lesson becomes boring it would majorly help with being able to reconstruct it as well. For difficult classes being able to know when the students are lost would help significantly in increasing the understanding of the material as teachers will be able to know exactly what the students dont understand, and thus be able to help them achieve better grades.

Being able to understand students emotions in a learning enviroment can also help with improving the school overall. SInce the technology would be able to understand the basic emotions like ""...happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness"" (paragraph 3), this can give a school tons of feedback on how to improve. For example, with negative emotions, a school would be able to improve its cafeteria food quality from knowing what foods are highly unpopular, and as a result save food from wasting. Or during school events, even though the event might be a success knowing how each of the students felt about the event would help with improving it for next year. The addition of this technology would allow a school to be the best the possibly could.

The addition of this facial technology can be quite revolutionary in a school setting. As students often dont share their true feelings, issues can be confronted and the students mentality can be improved. Also a better, and positive learning enviroment can be created. The ability to remove student confusion and make learning interesting would go a long way in helping not only the students grow and move forward positivly, but also the school as a whole.",0
"Dear Senator, I believe that the United States deserves someone who will lead this country to do the right thing, to make independent choices, and to be the best version of ourselves we can be every day. Now, how do we know when choosing a leader to represent us if thats what we will achieve when voting? We don't for sure, but we can make judgements and calls that will give us a better understanding to whom we are choosing. One of the biggest fought over rights was the right to vote, in which everyone wanted. Now that we have that vote, we should be able to use that freedom and have a say in who we want to represent us. Therefore, I think we should change the election to popular vote for the President of the United States rather than relying on the Electoral College.

The Electoral college consists of 538 Electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes are required to elect the president. Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party and given their own says and responsibilities. That being said, I think that getting rid of the Electoral College will eliminate all biased decisions and will create more freedom and responsibilities for the people of the U.S. to use their own judgement and choose who they think will best represent the country. Being in the electoral college and being selected to have a heavy say in who will be chosen is a big responsibilty and in that responsibility are duties to not only look at each candidate with one mind set and one point of view but to make an unbiased judgement. To make an unbiased call would mean to put away all your own thoughts and judgements and really get a good understanding of who the people truly need. Back in 1960, it states that segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. How can we tell that something like this will not happen again? Well if we choose to keep the Electoral College it very well could and the people of the country would not be making decisions for themselves as well.

Most worrying comes from the fear of a tie, in which the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. Because each state casts only one single vote. That single vote from Wyoming representing 500,000 voters could have as much say as the 55 representatives from California who represent 35 million voters. So therefore the election is really only a few swing voters away from a disaster. Because of the winnertakeall system, candidates really dont spend time campaigning in states they think they have no chance of winning, really only focusing on the bigger states with more votes. This is also unfair because then the people with the right to vote do not get a say in who they want to represent their country. The Electoral college really takes away many rights and freedoms to the people of the U.S. and doesnt give us the chance to have a say. Studies even show that 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now!

As well as having such a biased voting system, this is such an unfair system due to the fact the the popular vote winner could loose because of the Electoral College voters. This would be a very bad decision to keep the Electoral College especially if these Electoral voters have had their decision swayed by something. Then we will have a president that is only the president because of some voters biased and unfair judgemented calls. If one Electoral College voter has a certain view on a candidate, they could very well share that and somehow persuade the other voters decisions due to one persons thoughts and points of view on the candidate. One person can easily influence many peoples own judgements, which would cause them to choose poorly and only go under the pressure of that persons thoughts. The Electoral College has so many cons which would make it such a bad decision to keep this system and go by a biased and unfair advantage. So I believe that the best thing for the U.S. voting system would be to abolish the Electoral College and to keep the popular vote system so that everyone has their own say on who will achieve great things for our country.",0
"The value of technology we as a human race and generation have envovled with what we can do with technoogy. One example of this envolution is cell phones, we all have heard the tales of how are parents didn't even have or better yet even knew what a cell phone was when they were kids. This might just seem like boring old tales to the generation who grew up with all different types of cell phones. Even so these tales show us just how much technology has improved, and how we are still improving. Just like our lastest improvement in Technology ,the FACS system.

The FACS system stands for Facial action coding system meaning this is a system that reads and codes the facial expression a person makes and tell us what emotion they are feeling. Cool right; but now the next step or should I say next question is if we should allow this FACS system in classrooms to read students emtional expressions. I believe we should use this system in classrooms because all kids learn differently and the teacher can't always adhere to a certain kids way of learning. Therefore if we were to have this FACS system it would allow the computer to calculate the childs facial expression and tell the teacher so that they can better adjust their lesson and all the kids can be engaged better. If they were to allow this system in classrooms the kids would retain information better which might lead to better test score, and maybe even a better learning environment.

This FACS system was creayed by Pyschologist Dr. Paul Eckamn with Professor Thomas Huang from Beckman Institute for Advanced science at the University of Illnois. With the help of professor Nicu Sebe from the University of Amsterdam. Eckman has classified basic human emtions and paired them with the muscles involved with that certain emotion. By doing this it allows the computer to calculate the emotion being expressed ""even though indivduals show varyng degrees of emotions"" meaning we can calculate even the littest emotion. Which would help out greatly if put in a classroom ""a classroom computer could recongize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" ""then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"".

In conclusion the FACS system should be put into classrooms and if it were it would be a great aspect to students learning.",0
"The author of this article did a decent job at explaining why studying Venus is worth it despite any dangers that it has. They don't really explain why we should risk ourselves to study Venus but rather how we could do it. The author talks about how NASA have an idea to hover people above Venus and sending machines down to the surface of Venus.

The first thing that the author talks about is NASA's idea to hover people over Venus to get a closer look at it. In paragraph five it says, ""scientists to float above the fray"". It also states, ""Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans"". This dosen't give us a reason that Venus is worth exploring even though it's risky. It only tells us about ow we are able to get a closer look at the planet with our own eyes an not just some pictures or videos. Informing the reader about how to do something won't make them believe that it is worth doing.

The second thing that the author talks about is getting machines on the surface of Venus. In paragraph seven it states, ""mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces"". It also says, ""looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers"". These quotes demonstrate that the author is more focused on informing us on how we can do this rather than why we should do this. If people don't know why they should do something, then they wont care how they should do it. The author should have put more evidence on how we could use what we learn on Venus in stead of how we could get there safely.

In conclusion, the author didn't do the best job on explaining why it's worth to go to Venus because they focused on how we were supposed to get there. If they didnt just talk about how we were planning to get people and achines there, then it would have been alot better for explaining why it's worth it to study Venus despite of the many dangers.",0
"You may think that the face on mars was created by aliens and we say it isn't it's a natural landform sorta like some natural landforms on Earth like the Grand Canyon it's a natural landform but we can't actually prve the the face is a landform but we have a spacecraft named Viking 1 and 2 that has taken pictures of it so we can see if it was formed by aliens or if it is just a natural landform.

Here is how we think that it is a natural landform, as it says in the article ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, se if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!""and it also says ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West it reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on Mars.

Even though we think it is natural landform you guys think that aliens have made it and your point is as it says in the article ""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze.""

So as it says in the article ""It's not easy to target Cydonia Mars Global Surveyor is a mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down and scans the planet like a fax machine in narrow 2.5 km-wide strips we just don't pass over the face ver often.""

In conclusion even though the alien thing has a good point the pictures that Viking 1 and 2 got show that there are no alien markings and it is probably just a natural landform like the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho or the Grand Canyon.",0
"Have you had to make a really hard choice, and you keep second guessing yourself? Well, everyone feels like this at some point in their life. It's just if you want other people's opinion in your decision. There are many positives in other opinions other than yours. You should listen to them.

One opinion is not good when you want to make a good choice. Multiple opinions can help you find out what you really want to do, to make it a good choice. Here is an example, you are picking your classes for next year and it's a big year too, 9th grade. You are struggling to pick your last elective, you ask your family what to do. They tell you to do what you like. The next day you go to school and you ask all of your friends. They tell you to do what you love, band. So you go home and think about it, and come to the conclusion that you do love band so you go ahead and pick that as your elective. For this example you can clearly see that when you ask multiple people about what you should do, They tell you their honest opinion and it helps you figure out what you want to do.

Why is asking more than one person good? There are many reasons why it is good to ask more than just one person if you are wanting them to help you make a hard choice. One of them is, it opens your thought process, so if you are thinking a little bias on something. They can make you think about the other side of the problem. Another positive of have more than one opinion is, in the end result you will be happy. Even if it is not what you had expected, you will still be happy.

Some people dont talk to others when they feel a certain way. So lets say that your friend had her heart broken by someone, and you are have trouble with your relationship too. You go to them for help, and when you ask they give you all of their personal experience. To them it feels really good to open up to everything that had happened to them, and at the same time they are helping you. Sometimes you are helping a lot more than you think, not just for yourself but that friend.

Have you been second guessing yourself on a really hard choice? Everyone has done this at least once in their life. Their are people in your life that could help you stop second guessing yourself and make the right choice. There are so many positives in other peoples opinion. You should listen to them.",0
"Dear Senator,

I believe that is is time to get rid of the electoral college. The electrorial college is outdated and irrational, the best arguments are only assertions that dont have much basis in reality.

There are too many faults and risks in the electoral college such as the coming of a tie in the voting and that even though one canidate may win the popular vote they can still lose the election. As Bradford Plumer says ""over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"" (paragraph 9). It would be better in elections for it to go by popular vote instead of representatives deciding for you. A solution for this could be to simply go by popular vote. There is also the fact that the electors could defy the will of the people.

The electors are not trust worthy. ""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy"" (Bradford paragraph 11). They did this so the popular vote would not actually go to Kennedy. In the past electors have refused to vote for their party's canidate and cast a vote on whomever they want. People are thinking we have ""faithless"" electors because of this. We need to select electors that we can trust will go by the states overall decision instead of their own personal preference.

It is hard to vote for the president not knowing if your vote is actually going to mean anything. Us as voters cannot control what the electors do and who they vote for, we just have to hope that our canidate wins. Us as voters also sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong canidate. The voters need to know that their vote is going to mean something for the canidates running and that their decision will be taken into consideration.

To conclude the electoral college is not a safe and trust worthy system. I believe that the arguments against electoral colleges are much stronger tyhan the ones saying to keep it around, give the people what they want. No more electoral college!

sincerely,

"What I Think

I dont think the alien made the face because, how could aliens make a face like that and where could they get the materials to make it pop out like that? I think the Face is a natural landform because, first of all, if the aliens crated the mask, how did space scientists find it? Second, how did they get the materials to make the mask? Last but not least, how did the aliens make the face like that? I dont think aliens made that face because how can you posibly believe that aliens are are real? Aliens arent even real because if they were real, their head would not even be like that. Take a really good look at the photo to see who you think made the face. If you take a good look at the face you could tell that the face is made from a real human and not a alien. Where could aliens get sement from to even make the face pop out like that? I dont believe that aliens made a face like that because it is impossible for a type of species to do somehing such like that, aliens arent even real because scientist have been looking for them for a long time and they have not found one yet. That scientifically proves that aliens are not real they might be somewhere hiding or scientists havent found them yet. I dont even think aliens are a species.

"In the article ""The Challenge of Eploring Venus"" it talks about the second planet from our sun (Venus) often referred to as Earth's ""twin"". Becuase Venus is sometimes very close to Earth, humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on the planet. The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it represents. Considering that no spaceship survived the landing for more than a few hours, it explains how dangerous it could be to explore it.

However, the author still seems to think that Venus is worth studying. Even though Venus is so inhospitable, the author claims that scientists still discuss further visits to its surface. Reason being is becuase Venus may have been once like Earth at one point. The Author states that Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various froms of life, just like Earth. Even until this day Venus still has some features that are similar to Earth.

Venus has familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. It even sometimes can be our nearest option for a planetary visit which is crucial considering the long time frames of space travel the author states. The NASA (The National Aeronautics and Space Administration) has a possible solution for sending humans to study Venus after three decades. It would allow scientists to float above the fray and avoid the unfreindly ground conditons. Instead of the temperature being 800, it would be lowered to 170 if they used a blimp-like vehicle that would hover 30 or more miles over Venus. This would make Venus's conditions a little more bearable.

Putting this idea to action wouldn't provide enough insight of Venus and its conditions. Scientists couldn't even take sampls of rock, gas, or anything else if they did it that way. Therefore, the author claims that scientists are working on a new idea to get up close and personal to Venus, despite the risks.

Furthermore, the Author supports in many different ways how pursuing venus is worth the dangers. He provides examples of how sicentists are working to make something that would allow astronomers to visit and explore Venus, how they are fascinated by the planet, and how Venus has value not only becuase of the insight to be gained but also becuase of human curiousity will most likely lead us into many intimidating endevors and that dangers and doubts should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. Therefore, the author supports the idea that studying Venus is worthy of pursuit depite the dangers very well,",0
"Most students enjoy summer vacation, but some educators feel that the summer break is too long and when they return in the fall, they become more lazy and they can't retain information as easily when they were in school.

Summer break is the only long break that the school gave to the students to do all the things that they couldn't do during the school year and they can rest for a long preiod. I don't agree for these reasons:

First, A lot of students wants to work during the school year or do other things that take more time to do, but they can't do it because they got too much homework or they need to study for a tests that they have that week and they just had time for that. So in Summer break they got 3 months so they can work and do more things that they couldn't do during the school year. Students can work and have more experiences that can help them when they want to apply for another work that is much better for them and learn more things.

Next, Students needs a break after the school year. Most of the students get stressed for all the works and tests the teachers gave to them, their brains needs to relax and rest for a preiod time because it's not good to be always working, they got tired too. So Summer break is the best period to relax and distract for a period time. Students can go to the beach and have fun, Enjoy more time with their famillys, hang out with their friends, go visit new places, too much things they can do in this break and the weather is perfect too.

Finally, In Summer break the students don't worry about works or tests they may have need to present when the break is end. When they have Fall, Winter or Spring break the school gave to them just one week and in that week most of the teachers gave to the students works and tests they need to make after the week breaks, so in conclusion they don't have breaks because they need to study or do works that the school gave to the students. In Summer they don't need to worry about that and enjoy the time they got.

Some persons may don't agree with me because they think that have more breaks during the school year is better for students, but they need to know that the students got works during that breaks and they need to study for tests that they need to make after the week break, so in summary, they don't got that time to relax and give a time period to their brains so they can rest.

In conclusion, Summer break is the only long period that the students got to relax and they can do so many things that they couldn't do during the school year because of all the works they got and test that they need to study for. So Summer break needs to stay like that and is the best season for students so they can enjoy and have fun in their long break.",0
"Everywhere you go, everyone or at least someone makes a plan for their future reference or goal. Many people don't have the time to accomplish their goal and others have. Everyone has a way to achieve or succeed in something they like. Others like to stay idle or not tend to move to achieve their goal. And other people like to do something to accomplish their goal. Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle....it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" I totally agree to Thomas Jefferson's statement that, we accomplish more if we are doing something.

To start with, doing something can help you plan, achieve, or complete your future goal quicker.

For example, When you are given a task to complete you can't sit there idle to wait for someone to help you or wait for a magic to happen to complete your goal. If you want to graduate from high school and get to college with a scholarship, you will have to study hard to get to college. If you want to get a great permanent job, you still have to study hard and have a good resume. This will make you be faster with every work you be given to complete.

Furthermore, doing something always makes you more active. For instance, when you fail an exam or possibly one or too many of them, you can't possibly say that you do not care about your score, you have to take action, study hard, and hope for the next exams you would make it to the top. Whenever I fail a text, even though I don't like to retake a text, I prepare for the next text we are going to have for the next unit and for all the rest unit we are going to learn. I like to learn ahead of the class because am not really smart to learn in class so instead I learn and prepare ahead in class. Planning and taking notes in class or anywhere else can make you tend to do something than to sit there idle to plan your future. Making plans for the future helps you achieve or accomplish your goal.

On the other hand, many people often argue that staying idle to achieve your goal will make you less stressful. They say that because people want to achieve their goal by doing something, they often take pills that will make them stay awake especially for the high schoolers'. They say this because most high schoolers' wants to achieve more, graduate and get a better college and a great permanent job so they put all their might into studying and drinking and taking pills to stay awake and some student often get sick but can't stop cause they have been addicted to it. Although this may be valid, but doing something always makes you great and achieve your future goals and helps you to be more responsible in the future because in the future it will be easy for you to get a job and mostly half of every job will ask whether you have an experience or you being qualified for the job. And you probably don't know what's going to happen in the future so you to be prepared and planned for the future.

In a nutshell, I like to plan my future goals and learn ahead of my class. Completing an action all the time will forever make you involve in important duties. It also helps you discover more. It can also help you improve in your studies and make you a successful person in the future. It will make you useful in your workplace. Many teachers and other colleagues will admire and respect you and you can even turn out to be their model. You can get the college you have been always dreaming of and accomplish all your personal goals. ",0
"Some schools are considering the idea to offer distance learning for students to attend classes from home. Many students can benefit by considering this new idea for students to take classes from home by the way of online or videos. Although, many other students would not be agree with this idea.

In my opinion, I am not agree with the idea for students to attend classes from home. First, if the students are in their houses they would have more distraction, for example; they can get distracted by the food, many time food is a big distraction for students to concentrate in classes. They can also get distract because of the television, they can see something interesting in the TV and they would quickly get distracted. Also one of the biggest distraction for everyone is the cellphone. If a student is taking classes at home; no one would be responsible to tell him/she not to use their cellphones. Second, they would not take it seriously. They would feel free because they are in their houses. Sometimes they might take the classes; and sometimes they would not take them because no one would be telling them to do it. They would feel allow to do whatever they want because they would not have the rules like in a classroom. If the student is in a classroom; he/she receive more information, more examples, more attention, and more help. Every teacher has rules in their classrooms; rules that help students to be successful. And third

They would not be able to learn as much as they would in a classroom. They would not be able to ask questions and get the answer they would need. They would not receive as much attention as they need.

However, many students support the idea for students to attend classes from home. It can be considered a good idea for many students; because they would not be traveling from one place to another; it would safe them time. Also many times when there is a bad weather outside; many schools cancel classes; because they can't travel. And by considering this idea for students for students to attend classes from home would help them; because even if is raining or snowing, they will not cancel their classes. Therefore, many students agree with this idea because is not only going to safe them time; it would also help many students. Many students do not have transport. Sometime they have to walk or even pay so that they can go to school and attend to class. using the online program would give them a big support.

In conclusion, considering the idea for students to attend classes from home by the way of online or video can be a good or a bad idea for many students. I do not support this idea. Students should not attend to classes online or video. Students can get distracted easily by anything or anyone in their house. Many time studying at home give students many issues; there can be many people at home and too much noise that the student would not be able to concentrated and will get distracted. It can also happen that watching a video and that there's no one there to explain it; can make the students tire and he/she can fall sleep. Also, students will not take it seriously because there's not a teacher telling them and explaining them what to do. They would not receive as much education, information, and attention as they need. My position on this issue is to maintain the students attending to school. The students will learn more if they receive classes in school. Attend classes in a classroom with a teacher will provide students more support and it would help them in many ways to be successful in the future.      ",0
"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" supports his idea by using various different pieces of evidence while implementing the reality of the potentially dangerous exploration. The new developments in technology put furth a new pathway of innovation in reserach. With the new advancements in technology, scienctist are able to discover many similarities between Venus and Earth. The similarities also bring to view the danger of the planet Venus itself. Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because of the new advancements in technology, the similarities between the two planets, and the possible challenges of researching the untamed planet.

The ever growing advancement in technology allows for the further reasearch of the neighboring planet Venus. For example when the author says, ""another project is looking back to an old technology"" to gain insite of what previously worked and what could be improved. Another piece of evidence is when the author states an improvement that can be made, ""Systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant"". The greater and never ending advancements in technology allows scientist to explore the vast similarities between our planet and Venus.

The similarities of Earth and Venus make the reserach worth wild and valuable. For example, Venus has become very fascinated by Astronomers because of how it is ""the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"" which suggests that the research we gain from Venus could affect how we think about the Earth. Another example is when the author suggests that, ""venus can sometimes be our nearest option for planertary visit"".

Even with the similarities, the dangers of the planet can make the research difficult.

The conditions of Venus would make research very difficult but not impossible. The planet has many components that would make studying it very hard such as having, "" the hottest surface temperature"". Venus also has rough terrain and weather such as, ""erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightening strikes"" which would make landing a ship nearly impossible.

In conlcusion, the research of Venus is valuable to achieve because of the new technology, the likeness of our earth and Venus, and the challenges that will be faced during the reserach.",0
"Phones & Driving

Should people be able to use a cellular device while operating a vehicle? Different generations would agree and disagree. Older generation would say ""No, drivers should not be able to use a phone while driving."" While newer generation would say ""Yes, drivers should be able to use a phone while driving."" I believe that drivers should not be able to use a cellular device while operating a vehicle.

Statistics state that 26% of all crashes in 2014 involved cell phone use. 10% of those crashes are teen drivers of the age 15 to 19. Teens are more likely to text and drive because their world is revolved around social media. Because teenagers are young and naïve we believe that we are more capable of multitasking but, history has shown otherwise.

Some people think they are invincible and can't be killed. So, they think can text and drive and not get hurt or face the consequences. People as they get older think they can get away with more stuff like texting and driving, but life hits them with a wake-up call.

In conclusion, do you think drivers should be able to use their cell phone while driving? People need to keep their eyes on the road and on nothing else. They need to stay focused to their surroundings. Texting and driving kills, so be careful on the roads.",0

"I'll be talking about why it is valuable in a classroom full of students, and how it could help so many students. There are so many was he try to figure out what a person is feeling just by look when we don't want to invade but still be there. Many students sit in a classroom and don't have a clue what another person is feeling or if they should be there for them it would help them be a better person. Schools will gain so much from this new technology , and this is what i'll be addressing im this essay.

The first thing I'd like to address is the helping students to students it would be a great way to make everyone feel welcome when they're nervous. A lot of schools tend to tell students who struggle with something to talk to someone at school likes friends, teachers, and parents sometimes you can't do that with this friends would talk to you about it. This technology would help prevent so many things wrong with schools.

My main reason thinking this technology would be great is all the ways it could help teachers in the classroom for the students. One of the many ways I see this working is working on a new subject , and after working on it a teacher would see or ask how the students feel as they scan everyone's face to see how okay everyone is on the subject. In the passage it states that we could reveal so much about the science of emotions, and what better way to do that then to at school where kids, teens, amd soon to be adults are full of emotions one day to the next. Putting on a happy face according to the passage makes you feel slightly happy , and students will one hundred percent put on a happy face when they're getting a face scan just because it seems so natural to smile at pictures making the student happier.

As kids in school get older they will be getting to the age where soon they'll be able to vote it would be helpful to see how students feel about voting. Seeing which politician gets more approval helps see what needs to change in governments, and in politicians. Like stated in paragraph 8 in then passage muscles can detemine if a politician is lying or just trying to win votes compared to people who are actaually trying to make a difference. This technology help future law in forcement tell if a person is guilty or innocent, and that would be incredible for students to learn how to use this technology. For the future of any government I think this would be a great idea so how our growing youth how to use.

In conclusion having this would be great for helping students learn more about why we act a certain way when we feel an emotion. This would be great for teachers who need to know if students need more time working on a topic. Last but not least it would help students understand a lot more about our politicians , and how they say certain things for the vote.",0
"Dear Reader,

Good Afternoon, You may know me as Dr. Ema R. I'm Head Scientist down at NASA. So today I'm going to tell you about the 'Face on Mars' some people think its just a funky looking rock. Well my friends they are wrong. Now your going to move on to my studying and research I have done to find out what it is and I'm pretty sure I found the right answer.

The 'Face on Mars' was found by us NASA, in 1976. It got very popular over the years then. By popular I mean appearing in a Hollywood film, books, magazines, radio, and even talk shows. Now, I know what your thinking. What was so popular about a landform on a planet other than ours? Well first, its not a landform, and second lets be completly honest here, if you were looking through a telescope and saw a face in the sky what would you do? You wouldn't shake it off and go to bed. At least I wouldn't, I would be showing it to everyone and try to turn it into NASA because you would be a hero for maybe finding life on another planet.

What I think about this 'Face' is very important to the people that work with me in the lab. When they find something they bring it to me and see my opion so they can go look to see if I'm right, I mean I always am. Anyways, I would like to share with everyone here aboout my opionon on this, when the lab workers first came and told me about it I thought that they were nuts, like really a face in the sky guys? Until, one night I was working late in the lab trying to find out what this whole thing is about so I went out to the sky room to look through the telescope. I was zooming until I found Mars, I was searching through the planet and saw the 'Face' and it indeed looked like a face. I searched for more, then thats when I put my research to work.

During that time of reasearch I found out a lot of things. In my lab I didn't do much work on Mars itself It was mainly, Saturn and Jupiter. The work I did on Mars made me think that we aren't the only planet with life. This 'Face' isn't a landform, its a lifeform. Thats when my research was finished and I talked to my boss about what I thought, he told me to anouce it to my lab crew and see what else we could find out. I made my lab crew stay after hours to see if we could possibly find more lifeforms. Let me tell you a few more things, the reason I thought it was a lifeform is thats what all the faces on Mars, if there is life, look like. When life on Mars dies they will bury them like we do.

Also, the way this 'Face' appeared there when it was buried. It got buried there forever ago and now the skull is popping up. So now the Space crew turned the Mars rover into an investagator if thats what you want to call it. The leaders would put it into motion and try to find more life forms or signs of life. Maybe these forms there, don't need to live with water and oxygen like we do they may just have to live off of sunlight or dirt maybe something crazy like that. NASA will one day find more evidence of lights on other planets.

I would like to thank you for reading my article, please if you think you have information about the 'Face' or other planets, contact us NASA on our website, www. NASA.com which also has an info hotline for you to learn more, and our Captains email. Thank You, once again.

Sincerely,

"Driving essay

I believe that people shouldn't be able to use cell phones in any kind of capacity while driving because not only is it bad but, it's also dangerous for you and whoever else is in the car with you.

Transporting other human beings in your vehicle is a tremendous responsibility, on that many young drivers take lightly. Sending or reading a text message while driving puts your passengers' lives at a significantly higher risk of being involved in an accident while riding in your vehicle. Could you live with the knowledge that your decision to pick up your phone while operating a vehicle caused someone to suffer a life-altering injury or be killed.

Many brands of new cars are equipped with technology that connects your cell phone to your vehicle's stereo system. If you drive an older model vehicle, invest in a cell phone with Bluetooth technology and voice recognition technology that will allow you to send and receive messages hands-free. The reason why I am saying this is because if you could speak to your phone to do things it would be easier for you to drive on the road.

Everyone already knows how bad it is to text and drive and that it can cause accidents, but I never told you how many there has been. In 2011, 1.3 million automobile accidents were caused by texting and driving. Texting and driving make you twenty-three percent more likely to be involved in an accident.

After all the bad things that can happen, I believe that nobody should be allowed to use cell phones while doing any operating in a vehicle. Also, in 2015, 3,477 people were killed, and 391,000 were injured in crashes involving distracted drivers using cell phones on U.S. roads. The bottom line is that texting and driving is seriously dangerous so put the down the phone. Keep your eyes on the road and stay safe.",0
"No not really that has nothing to do with the classroom and a lot of kids feel the same in a classroom. The kids in a classroom that i see or seat in are mostly bored or tired,but some kids are awake and have their eyes on the board or teacher to learn.

I think this would be a waste of time in the class unless you are useing youing it on little kids. Most of the older kids are way past a computer that can show a happy or sad face . I have a fine time talking to people in the real world not a computer,if a computer made a weird face at me i would probalby get up and walk away from it. This is kind of dumb i think you should be able to know or ask some one about their feelings in the real world not on the computer pull up a weird face to show how they feel. I strongley dislike this in a lerning zone because then how are kids to know how other people feel without the computer telling them,with a happy,sad,and mad face coming up on the screen. This is somthing a human should know how to tell human feelings.",0
"Dear State Senator,

The Electoral College is a process not a place. When the founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and also a popular vote of approved citizens. That should stay remain the same they should not be any change to the Electoral College system.

The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electorals. When the electors have a meeting thats when they are able to for the President, Vice President that is running for office. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors, majority of 270 electoral vote, is to elect the President. Each state is entitled allotment in its Congressional delegation which means one for each member in the House of Representives plus two for your Senators.

Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated three electors and are treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. Each candidate that is running in the election has their own group of electors, generally chosen by the candidate's political party. The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The voters help choose their state's electorals when they voted for the President, when they vote for the candidate they are actually votin for the candidate's electors. Voters are more likely to pay attention to the efforts the candidate put to win the election like the campagin.

The Electoral College system has a method called ""winner- take-all that awards all the electors to the winning presidental candidate. After the presidental election the state governor will prepare a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" that which list all the of the candidates that ran for office, along with the names for their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winner of the presidental candidate of your state. The Certificate of Ascertainment is sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the offical records of presidential election.",0
"The Facial Action Coding System is a new form of technology that enables computers to identify human emotions. Will the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable? No. "" FACS"" will not be valuable to read the emotional expressions of students. A theory and technology such as emotions and the emotional state of someone should be based off of science instead of being based off opinion. Take a minute and compare this new piece of technology to a quiz given on the internet to see what celebrity I would be. Moral of the story if the person can fake it, they can make it. Someone can make believable facial expressions all day does not mean they are happy, sad, or any other emotion based on what they look like. A student may come in looking grumpy does not mean they are grumpy, maybe just maybe have you ever thought. "" WOW, that just might be their natural facial expression."" To end with, unless this technology is enhanced and backed up with science instead of opinion I do not think it will be very dependable in determing the emotional expressions of students.",0
"Do you really thing a land form could make a face ? To me that seems something is very unlikely. A planet that we do not look alike can make a face as a organism on earth? Well i don't think so and here is why.

The photo isn't clearly shown as a face it just looks like a planets land form.

It may aslo be a feture that is only unique to this palnet like the moon has thousands of craders. I just feel as if Earth has all the water and green grass on it mayb Mars has these land forms instead. Also it might be like how people gaze at the stars or the clouds to see if they make an object or a human face. If you look closley you can see that the

""face"" has ridges or canyon. So maybe the ridegs/canyons made the land form that way.

NASA on the other hand and says there is likelyness of a human face. They also believe it is an alien artifac. According to the picture they say because of the shadows it portraies eyes, nose and mouth. They say that in the years that they took the picture it has developed more and more over the spands of years.

In conclusion the ""face'' to me is still just a land form. Just because it looks as if it is something could not just be made out of a human face. If they had more evidence then it would be believeable but until then my opnion is still that it is a land form.",0
"Dear Florida Senator,

The Electoral College has been in the United States for a very long time. It has worked for the most part and we have been happy with it for the most part, but ""for the most part,"" doesn't cut it. The system has to be one that works all the time without fail. Said system has to make sense. That is why electing by the popular vote should be our's.

Except for two states, the electoral votes are, ""Winner take all."" This means that if the  popular vote is obtained in a state by just a smidge, the the entire state's votes go to that candidtate. This makes absolutely no sense at all. The ""big states"" like California, Texas, and Florida have about thirty to fifty five electoral votes unlike most other states which have three to ten electoral votes. If the ""big states"" were to be won by a little by one  candidate, then he or she would have over one hundred votes toward his or her candidacy but only about sixty percent of the popularity for those states. This happened to Al Gore in 2000 against George W. Bush.

Another problem with the Electoral College is that the creators did not make it so that a tie is impossible. Richard A. Posner explains in his article from

Slate Magazine that although the total number of electoral college votes is even, it is still very unlikely. Now which is more likely, something to happen out of 580 things or something to happen out of many million?

When voting for the president, the voter feels like he or she has the power to choose our nation's leader. When the voter realizes they are not voting for the president, they are, in fact, electing chosen people to vote for them, it does not really have the same effect.  This is explained in Bradford Plumer's ""The Indefensible Electoral College."" Electing by the popular vote would make it seem more personal and voting would have more meaning.

Richard A. Posner also said that the Electoral College made candidates go to more than one region of the United States to gain support. In fact, they just go to swing states and states they know they will win. Electing by the poplular vote would make candidates go to every state to gain support.

The Electoral College may or may not have worked before, but it just doesn't now. It will take a while to implement the process of electing by popular vote, but when we do, it will definitely be worth it.

Sincerely, PROPER_NAME",0
"Changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United State is the best way to select the prisedent, because people has right to pick any prisedent for them selve.

popular vote for the prisident is fair way to vote, there's no cheeting.

I think that The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.

The electoral college is unfair to voters, because winner got to take all system in each state.

it's also dangurios for all the people in US.

If the winner got to take all system in each state, then he able to do anything he/she wants.

It's like a disaster factor, and the system allows for much worst. and consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors. that those clectors could always defy the will of the people.

on electorall college system voters vote not for the president, but for slate of elector.

people vote for president, not for slate of elector!!!!

electoral college may cauge trouble, it may mess up the system,",0
"Venus is the second closest planet to the sun. Many people would find a planet like this an intersting topic of research to pursue. In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is about the planet Venus and all of it's glory. This article is about people who want to explor the planet Venus. They believe exploring Venus is a mission that is worthy to be pursued. This essay will include, the study of Venus, the pursuit in exploring this planet, and the dangers that could occur traveling to Venus.

Venus is known as the Earth's twin because of the density and size of both planets. They both are very alike to one another. Because the two planets are very similar, astronmers are facinated by this thought of traveling to another planet that Earth. In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author says, ""These conditions are far more exterme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" (paragraph 3). The author has done research on this topic for some time and he realizes that Venus's atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater. than on Earth. The author finds this planet very different from the planet we live on now. And is far more dangerous and fascinating than other planets.

Many people have done research on this planet because most astronomers want to see this new planet and experience all of its differences. If the astronomers traveled to this new planet, they are predicting that they will be able to survive when going there. The tempeture in Venus will be very ""toasty"" because this planet is very close to the sun and that is one of the variables the researchers are trying to get around to. In this article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", it says, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfreindly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way."" (paragraph 5). In this quote, NASA is trying to find solutions on how to get to Venus in a very safe manner. They know that tempetures will be very hot almost to 200 degrees Fahrenheit, but they asume it will be survivable for humans.

Going on this trip will be very dangerous because of high tempetures and the situation at hand. There are many dangerous ahead in this traveling experience if they proceed in taking action. Travelers believe that it will be an experience that they will not regret and they are excited to learn more about this planet even if it is very dangerous they still want to proceed in this event. In this article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author says, ""Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks. Or maybe we should think of them as challenges. Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus."" (paragraph 6).In this quote, the author proceeds in saying that travelers are already too deep into this research that they have already found solutions and they have already thought of occuring problems that they are now trying to fix before they take action. A couple of their concerns are when they are close to Venus, the tempetures will be rising which is a very frightning thought for these explorers. But they are keeping their heads ups and continuing their research and expirementing solutions.

Exploring Venus is a very big task for these explorers. Having this challenge for them is encouraging and everytime they find something new about this planet, it makes them want to keep dipping and finding more new things about this planet. These explorers find joy in this research on Venus and all of the differences when comparing Venus to Earth. These explorers might be going into some trouble when planning on traveling to Venus, but that doesn't matter to them. They want to explor this planet even if it is dangerous or unrealistic. They will keep searching for a reasonable solution for this journey.",0
"In the classroom setting, most of the time teachers struggle to understand the ever changing moods and emotions of their students.

This presents a problem for the education system, as trainer and trainee usually need to see eye to eye for progress to be made.

Fortunately for us, technology has improved to the point that computers can describe all the emotions on someone's face.

The use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because a computer will not tire and therefore will be able to calculate emotions in a longer timeframe than humans, it can be more accurate than normal people, and it could actually modify different procedures based on the software's collected data.

First and foremost, the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because a computer will not tire and therefore will be able to calculate emotions in a longer timeframe than humans.

In the article Making Mona LIsa Smile there is a quote that says; ""The software is the latest innovation from Prof. Thomas Huang...(D'alto, 1)""

The quote clearly says that the emotion-recognition technology is computer software, and therefore can function for longer amounts of time than a normal human, which makes it valuable.

Secondly, the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it can be more accurate than normal people.

In the article called Making Mona Lisa Smile, there is a quote that states; ""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements...

By weighing the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions.(D'alto, 4)""

Most of the time, one can really only make an educated guess at what's on other people's minds.

But with the use of the emotion-recognition software, one can accurately describe the emotions on one's face, which makes it valuable.

Furthermore he use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it could actually modify different procedures based on the software's collected data.

In the article called Making Mona Lisa Smile, there is a quote that says; ""A classroom computer [using emotion-recognition software] coul recognize when a stidnet is becoming confused or bored... Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.(D'alto, 6)""

The quote explains that the emotion-recognition software has the capability to modify the way is does a task based on the data is collects.

This alone makes it a very effective instructor, and also very valuable.

In conclusion, the use of technology to read the emotional expresions of students in a classroom is valuable because it can keep functioning for a long time, it can represent its collected emotion data as numerical values, and it can change how it does things based on this.

The tech indeed very valuable.

It could change learning forever.",0
"What you are about to read is going to give you insight on the advantages and disadvantages there are when talking about limiting car usage. In the next few paragraphs and sentences I am going to state true facts about the advantages and disadvantages of limiting your forms of transportaion. I will also talk about not just the individual advantages and disadvantages, but I will also talk about how it could help or hurt, a community. Now strap down, let's click on those seat belts, and go for a ride, all puns intended.

I think it would probably be best if we started this paper off by talking about the disadvantages right off the bat. Now, the first one that I think everyone thought of right away would be that of, how could places like the United States of America, a country that is thousands of miles wide, convert to what is being proposed in these articles? Where I live now is on the ocean, so on the outskirts of our city, Ponce Inlet Florida, to be exact. If our county, Volusia, was to change to this ideal, then we would have to bike about 3 miles just to get to the bridge to get across the river back to main land. Another example would eb that where I used to live, Howard Suamico Wisconsin, there was a lot of land seperating my old house and the main drag of my town. In the summer, it wouldn't be that big of a deal to just take a bike and gon on a bike ride, but when it came around to it being winter I would probably want to take a car that had 4x4 wheel drive, if you catch my drift. I think that the disadvantages are painfully obvious when it comes to this system, but I could definetley see it working in large citites not unlike Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, and so on.

Now that we've finally gotten the disadvantages out of the way, we can talk about how this would help communitites all across the world become safer and cleaner. In the first article I read a quote that I thought was perfect for the advantages paragraph.

""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happer this way,""

(Paragraph 2, Lines 4-5) This really got my attention right from the get go because It made me think about our daily lives and how I feel when I'm behind the wheel. Im always stressed Im going to wreck my car! The other thing that caught my eye was when I read about the Columbian city of Bogota. In Bogota, they banned all motor vehicles except buses and taxis for a day. A businessman was quoted as saying

""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,""

It seems that when the idea of outlawing all motor vehicles and having only bikes and your feet for transportation, people are a lot happier.

In conclusion, I would love to see less cars on the roads, and see more people switch to greener alternatives such as bikes, skateboards, feet, etc. I think it would also take care of the issue of obesity and pollution. The only thing that I find hard to believe is that we would just disband the use of cars all together. I think that we have built so many roads all over the place that finding another use for them would be hard. All in all however, I think this is a great idea. To have communities closer together which would form stronger community bonds and it would allow us to drastically reduce the amount of pollution we create each year.",0
"Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become a key part of our lives. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc. Sometime we can even do two or more of these things at the same time. Unfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones like driving while being on it. As a society we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety and health as well as others because we can't put our cell phones down.

Most people are guilty of using cell phones while driving. Although have we ever thought about it's danger? Five states plus Washington D.C. have hand-held bans and many states have bans for specific drivers. 60 percent of teens admitted to risky driving. Nearly half of those drivers admitted to text messaging while driving.

In April, 2009 in Houston Texas five children lost their lives when the car they were in lost control and slid into a rain swollen ditch. The driver lost control of the vehicle when he went to answer his ringing cell phone. The car went into the ditch and swept 100 feet down the raging current. The rescue team were unable to reach the car with the trapped passenger. Two adults and one ten year old girl were able to escape, but five children under the age of seven all passed away. You start to think to yourself is a cell phone worth all the dangers?

Another reason and perhaps a more tangible reason to ban cell phones while driving, is to prevent car insurance from rising. In society, money is tight when it comes to doing different things with the way the economy is now. If you can try being careful because the money you put towards careless accidents that can be prevented can be put to the light bill etc. The more the number of tickets you attract against your name, the higher the insurance will be. In recent studies companies are paying close attention to the link between cell phone use and car accident and many auto insurance websites warn of the distracted driving driving.

Insurance companies are just waiting for you to mess up so they can increase your insurance. Don't fall for it, your cell phone can wait till your out of the vehicle or when your parked. Especially with the new hands-free law in Georgia with some real expensive tickets so my best advice is to stay off your phone in the vehicle. The consequences are not worth it so just put the phone died.",0
"When you are seeking for help, what do you do? You probably ask people. When I ask people for help I get lots of good answers. Asking for questions is better than staying quiet and not knowing. When you ask mulitiple people for help, you can get a wide variety of answers that will help answer your question. For example: When I had difficulty learning a unit in math, I asked multiple friends and got multiple answers that helped me learn it. Asking one person alone can get you answers but asking more people is better because maybe if you ask one, they could be wrong and all the others could be right. For example: I asked my friend the answer to a question, he was wrong but I asked my other friends and they were right. When you are seeking for help try to ask questions. When you ask questions you get right answers. In conclusion, asking questions leads to answers and less questions.",0
"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. The author provided reasons on why exploring Venus is so important.

The author beleives that Venus should be explored because it is ""Often referred to as Earth's ""twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of size, and occasionally the closest in distance too"". (Paragraph 2). Another reason why the author believes that Venus should be explored is because ""It may have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.""( Paragraph 4). These two reasons explain why it can be beneficial to explore Venus. To prove that Venus was and is so similar to Earth the author provided details such as, ""Venus was probably covered with oceans and could have supported various forms of life,"" and ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" (Paragraph 4). Providing these details helped support the idea that Venus is so similar to Earth. Proving that Venus is so similar to Earth can show people that it might be worthy to explore it. The author also talked about ways that could possibly make exploring Venus safer. In paragraph 5 the author says, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray"" giving this information can show that there are safe options that are in the works for exploring Venus.

The author's use of supporting details was well used in supporting his idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. The author also stated possible disadvantages and dangers that could happen which helped improve his claim. If the author only used the positive affects and left the dangers out I think it would have hurt his article. Overall, I think this article was written well with plenty of supporting details.",0
"To Whom It May Concern, The Electoral College that is used when electing the president is a flawed system and should be replaced by and election by the popular voted. The Electoral College does not always show what the people want and it is unfair to voters in certain states.

The Electoral College should be replaced with an election by popular vote because it is not always a fair representation of what the voters want. This means that if most of the popular votes can be for one candidate, but the other candidate wins the majority of the Electoral votes. This is shown in the article In Defense of the Electora College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner. In thsi source the author states,""But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed...however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral voter will not win the popular vote.... It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush, but fewer electoral votes""Posner, Line 16. This shows how what the majority of the people want to happen, will not always happen in this flawed system.

This system is also unfair to voters in certain states. Candidates usually campaign in what are called ""swing states"" that could vote for either candidate, but this means that many states that candidates are confident of winning in or states they are sure of losing in, will not be campaigned at all. This unfairness is shown in the article The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer. This article says,""Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they have no chance of winning... During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all,including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't see a single campaign ad""Plumer, Line 13. This unfairness causes voters in some states to be uninformed about the candidates which could cause them to vote for people they wouldn't if they had seen some campaigning.

The Electoral College is a flawed system that is unfair to voters and does not always reflect what the citizens want.",0
"The Electoral College, good or bad? Many may feel that the Electoral College has more downs than ups, but thats not always the case. I feel that despite these common views we should keep the electoral college due to the fact that popular vote may not always be the best way.

There have been multiple instances in which the electoral college has saved many elections due to the fact that the popular vote was too close. This ""college"" consists of multiple slates of electors. These electors are really who we vote for when we vote for president. Every 'state' including the District of Columbia are allocated a certain amount of electors. These electors then vote for whoever won the popular vote in that state despite the other sides views. This is called a ""winner-take-all"" system. Yet there are two states, Maine and Nebraska, that have a ""proportional representation"" system. When it is done the governor creates a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" which basically is the official way of declaring who in that state won the vote.

The Electoral College is more good then bad due to the fact that it has saved instances of a tight vote. The Electoral College does require the presidential candidates to abide by some rules. One of which is making the candidate focus on other areas rather than the region they know they will win the vote in. Another like i have been talking about is the outcome, it enables a balance that should be kept between the popular votes. It is also another way like the two houses of Congress; where it keeps the balance of political choice between big states and small states. It also avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast.

Now many may find it that the electoral college are beings from a bottomless pit because of the year 2000 election between Al Gore and George W. Bush; with Al Gore winning with over 60% of the popular vote. This is most likely due to the reason why he mmay have stretched out all of his visits between the states. He may have won more popular votes in total than Bush but he may have appealed to a minority of people in each state so the overall of the state wanted Bush. Some say the best argument against the Electoral College is the disaster factor. Just because some may choose not to vote for the person they are supposed to doesnt mean that the entire college is bad. These things are going to heppen with people who think differently. Just because someone may think McDonald's is nasty and they refuse to go; are you going to not go because they don't? This happens in everything we do we are only human, we are different, not everyone thinks in the same way. When we do it is a recipe for disaster.

So, in my opinion, we must keep the electoral college if we want to keep the balance in everything the US stands for, politically and demographically. These are facts that should not be ignored, just because some see differently doesn't mean we have to change the foundation of our society.",0
"To start off, the electoral college is a system thats been around for ever but is getting outdated. I think that some people might want a different system while others prefer the same or dont care. For all we know,Bob Dole could be right about abolishing the electoral college. Or maybe it needs a new way of carrying the votes. Me, I think we should get a new system as well, but heres why.

Time has nothing to do with this way of voting, nothing at all. But maybe we should see some changes in the way we elect a president. 60% of people would prefer that a direct election be held. Others are probably lazy or cant make it if one was held, and thats why they prefer the system were using now. But problems are starting to surface with this, already outdated system.

The very first problem already is the fact that they vote for the slate of electors and not to vote for just the president. Then the fact that you vote for 1 out of 34 democratic electors. If that one that you chose won the statewise election they would get the plethora of votes that were earned. All this locomotion instead of just voting for the people that you want to lead the whole country. If we were to vote for just the president and vice president of the state and whomever else we vote for, less problems would be seen.

More factors are that the state legislatures are basically responsible for choosing the electors. This is a very unfair factor because they choose people who oppose a candidate. If that happens, the popular votes dont transfer to that specific candidate. Also sometimes the electors refuse to vote. This system is unfair to voters because of the winner take all system that occurs.

The electoral college may have been around for a long time, but is getting old. The systems it uses are irrational. Its methods are outdated and bias. There is not much reason for it. We need a new system.",0
"Hi, I'm Kelvin and I go against this technology to read students emotional expressions. This is totaly BS, Dr. Huang and Pro. Nicu made this really cool software called the Facial Action Coding System. Calculating emotions is diferent from coding your face with a 3-D mode of your face that could barely even look like you. Plus there are more than the basic six emotion everbody has. It is still a very cool idea but not for us students.

Dr. Huang said that every facial emotion is universaly the same in paragraph 4, but some people can feel emotions without making that facial emotion on thier face. This software can be an evasion of privacy for students who would not like to be disterb by this software showing it to your teacher and then the teacher would call or give you a private lesson in school. Mixed emotions are even more complecated for the software to know. There are 44 major muscles in our faces are realy cool but, technology is not yet advanced for this to be true. And the Mona Lisa could just be happy.

How can this ""Facial Action Coding System"" even tell the Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy. The technology is not advance enough to say what emotions we have. How can this software even know the emotions we have on a picture. The Mona Lisa is a painting not a picture, so that cannot be corect. Da Vinci Code is something different from Dr. Huang's emotion algorithms. Communication doesn't have to do anything with the software, but maybe us the students.

And finaly this stuff can't be used in public, who is going to use this sofware than the school. Video games are mostly the freedom of choice for most people . And emotional communication will still need to wait for technology to advance. Who is even gona use this. People do not caare what think about us the students. Making privat lessons based on our faces isn't a good idea. Many bad culd use this software to invade privacy from others.

And this is my reasons why I think this software sucks and should never be used.",0
"Many people believe that the 'Face on Mars' was formed by aliens. What do you think? If you were told that the face on Mars was created by aliens, what would you do? What would you say? I know what I would do. I would call them crazy and explain to them that aliens do not exsist and that it was a fact of science.

The 'Face on Mars' is a natural landform. The light from the sun is shone across the landform to make it look like it has two eyes, a nose, and a mouth like a human person, but, if you were to create an exact copy of Mars, put on a different scale, hold it still, and shine light at the exact angle of the sun, you would see that the sun is what really causes the 'Face on Mars' to appear to look the way it does.

Aliens, if they exsisted, could not have created something so magnificent and perfect that at that angle it would look like a face. Scientists have studied the geography of Mars for years and have had nothing to say about aliens. They have prooven their facts and have given us reason to believe that this was simply the way Mars was stuctured and that the rays of the Sun are the cause of it looking like a face.

If aliens did create the 'Face on Mars', why would our scientist have not discovered them? Why havent we ever then seen one before? For those that believe that it was aliens that sculpted Mars, I am sorry, but you are wrong. Mars was naturally formed and can never and will never be changed by aliens because aliens simply do not exsist.

So, for all of those out there in our lovely world that think that aliens do infact exsist and that they somehow, over millions of years created a 'Face on Mars', I would like to say one last thing on my behalf, aliens do not exsist and could not have created something so mindblowing.",0
"Imagine if you only had one person/option to ask for help. That would be kind of difficult to learn new stuff and opinions. Asking multiple people for help is better than one person because you can learn more from different people. Three reasons that state my point are, people can get more ideas, they can hear different opinions, and they can learn more.

Asking multiple people for help can get you more ideas. These following are explained examples of why you can get more ideas from just asking more than one person. You can learn what other people say. When people learn what other people think they get more ideas. Another example is they can get more details on what their asking for. When people only get one answer it has to be correct, but when they get more than one they have options to choose from. Also, if people ask more people for answers they will have a more detailed response. To be fair, its hard to ask multiple people because its hard to find people that always give the right answer, but thats why we ask different people. All of these are explained reasons of why its better to ask multiple people rather than one.

People have different opinions. These are examples of why asking multiple people for help is better than asking one person for help. Not everyone has the same opinions. every one has different reasons or examples so people could get more details. Another example is that there could be better opinions than others. If there are multiple answers there is more to choose from. Also there are more resources. Using resources people can choose which answer they think is most likely correct. These examples are why having more options for help can help someone make a better choice.

Someone can learn more from asking more people. Asking more than one person to help can help things be more understandable. It helps people understand that there is can be more than one answer. Another example is that you can learn more about the question your asking. There could be a question someone is asking about, and that person changes their opinion a lot. Asking more people for help helps you learn more. If there are more choices to ask for help the more people learn. I want you to try this, try asking more than one person for help and see what information you find.",0
"Dear, Senator

I think the president should be elected by popular vote not electors. Heres some reasons why i think the president should be voted by popular vote and not electors.

One reason is when you vote for your president your acually voting for the presidents elector. So basically your not voting fot a president your votng for a elector that votes for you. After the election the government prepares a ""certificate of ascertainment"" a certificate of ascertainment is a listing of all the candidates who ran for president along with the names of there electors. The certificate of ascertainment also declares the winning president and which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the elector in december of election year.

Another reason is more people would rather abolish electoral college. Electoral college is dumb because there was a gallup poll in 2000 taken shortly afte Al Gore. In the poll Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency because of the electoral college. (In the 2000 U.S. presidential race, Al Gore received more indiviual votes than George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush won the election, Bush received 271 electoral votes and Gore received 266.) Under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president but for slate electors. Who can be electors? It can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state, sometimes state conventions, sometimes state partys central committee, and sometimes the presidential candidates.

Last but not least the disaster factor. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. In 1960 segregationnists in the louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. In the same vein, ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their partys candidate and cast a deciding vote for whoever they please. What happens if a state sends two slates of electors to congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the senate, validated only his opponents electors. The most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote in that case the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president and The Senate would choose the vice-president. Each state only casts one vote that means the single representatives from Wyoming representing 500,000 voters would have as much say as California who represents 35 million voters. An electoral tie seems unlikely think of this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976 a tie would have occured if 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted diffrently. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.

What im trying to say is the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. During 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all including Rhode island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a single campaigh ad. The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrartional. The best arguements in favor of it are mostly assertions. Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college.",0
"The Face on mars is just a natural landform. any scientist believe it was created by aliens, but i feel like its just a normal landform. To prove that it is a natural landform and not built by position of mars, erosion, and time change.

The position of the planet can also be the reason why the rock looks like a face. In paragraph 2, it says that the rock did have shadoes that could give anillusion of eyes, mouth, and a nose. In paragraph 8, It gives the season which caused clouds. Clouds are one of many reasons that causes shadows. These clouds could of ben in a cerrtain position that gave ""The Face"" illusions.

A possible explanation that the face is just a natural landform is erosion. In paragraph 8, it states that . Mars experienced a vey cloudy time. As known that clouds can form rain and/or wind which can be used to wither ddown rocks. Wind on Mars could be harsh and putting a lot of pressure aganst a giant rock causeing it to make indents. These indents can be seen as eyes, mouth, or even a nose.

As you see in the pictures that were taken by Viking 1, over the time period the face began to dissapear. In the pre-story,

""The Face"" was hand made by an alien then wouldn't you think that they would keep itin good condition . Instead ""The Face""

deformed over the time. Just like on earth, rocks break down over time.

There are many factors that can be said to prove that ""The Face"" is just a natural landform.

Even an website like the one in paragraph 7, can state that it was just a nateral landform. With enough evidence you can prove that it was indeed a natural landform.",0
"The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The meaning of Electoral College is stated in Source 1: What is Electoral College and in paragraph 2.  The Electoral College process consists of the selection of electors, the meeting of electors where they vote for president and vice president, and the countiing of the electoral votes by congress. It consist of 538 electors. a majority of 270 eletoral votes is required to elect the president. The electoral College is very important because it helps us decide who the new president of the United States is going to be, but alot of people thimk that it is unfair and should be abolished.

To begin with, Electoral College is unfair because voters do not vote for the president they vote for a slate of electors, who turn in elect the president. The electors can be anyone not holding public office. The elector are picked by the state. Sometimes the voters cannot pick who the electors vote for.  ""The electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" It is hard to say but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the Electoral College.

But, in defense of the Electoral College, there are a few reasons to keep our disliked method of choosing the president. One reasons is the Elecotoral College requires a prestidential canidate to have trans-regional appeal. Also to avoid the problem of elections in which no canidate receives a majority of the vote cast. Lastly the winner take all method of awarding electoral votes induces the canidates to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states.

Inconclusion, the Electoral College can be a good way to vote, but also it can be a bad way to vote.",0
"Phones & Driving

Many humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. Although, this may be a norm in our daily routines, some people risk their lives by using their cell phones while operating a motor vehicle. By doing this, people can cause a hazardous driving experiences for themselves and others. The dangers can include, distractions that cause car accidents, property loss or even death. With the potential that phone usage and driving can cause so much harm, it should be a legal band to cease all cell phone usage while driving.

In 2018, the state of Georgia adopted the ""hands-free"" law. This law doesn't allow the phone to touch any part of the body while driving a motor vehicle. This means that any touching, texting, calling, dialing, reading emails, surfing the internet, recording, etc. are all banned while driving. Doing any of these activities cause distracting conditions that are dangerous and unsafe and can result in the driver straying, losing control of the vehicle, or crash.

According to NHTSA, 3,166 people died as a result of distracted driving, in 2017.

With this understanding, nothing on your phone is worth that much of your attention.

Death is a real possibility if the law is not taken seriously. In Georgia, there are about 4 accident related deaths per day and nearly 1,500 fatalities per year. A quick glance at your phone or taking your eyes off the road for as long as 30 seconds, can escalate to a lifetime of regret, pain, and sorrow for yourself or someone else's family.

This reason alone, should serve as enough rational to band cell phone usage all together or maximize the cost of fines for offenders of the ""hands-free"" law.

In the event, that there is an accident that is caused by violating the ""hands-free"" law or distracted driving caused by phone usage, it has unforeseen financial damages, as well. Although, insurance is meant to protect us, it's still at a cost. Each year it cost about $230.6 billion to United States residents for accident claims. This can place a heavy burden on any family that is under prepared for life's unexpected turns.

In conclusion, there are so many things in life that we cannot control that can result in financial burdens or death, we should ask ourselves is answering a text worth my life? I'm guessing its not but so often, we risk our safety to do just that. Not using the phone while driving is a behavior that can be controlled, especially, if we consider how important life, focus, and finances are. If we take the time to put the phones down while driving we can ""arrive alive.""",0
"The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by saying ,""Venus is Earth's twin and closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size"". In the article it says that Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. Venus is the second planet closest to the sun and because of that the tempetures in Venus are way different than Earth's tempetures.

But some people or scientist actually belived theres life in venus just like earth but alot different because in the article it says,"" Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported varios forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on earth for example theres surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Even people think that Venus is probably our nearest option for a planetary visit just like in the article it says,"" The National Aeronautics (NASA) has one particular compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus"". NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray. Since Venus is the second closest planet to the sun the tempetures are really hot, compared to Earth's tempetures. Its so hot the tempetures in Venus are like 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that sea level on Earth.

But Earth and Venus are two planets that probably had same features along time ago and that we all know theres alot to discovered in our solar system and thats what i think the author was trying to support. And mybe it might happen in the near feuture and discovered more about Venus but for right now only time will tell.",0
"I think that failure plays a crucial role during the persuit of sucess.

Failure is inavoidable the path to success is not straight one.

everyone fails sometime in their life .

Walt disney was fired for a newspaper because he lacked creativity.

Learn from your mistakes, if you make a mistake at least you know not to do it again.

A failure might put an end to one thing (idea or opportunity) but lead you to other for example: I used to try to draw realistic people and animals with pensils, and then I found that i was better at zentangle (an art style that consists of repetitive designs and patterns. The success you end up having might not be the kind you originally had in mind. Failures could lead you into in something else entirely.

Failure often leads to problem, working to solve problems and getting through difficult times makes you smarter and stronger as a person. By dealing with your failures, you will be more prepared and experienced in the fututre. Strength, intelligente, problem solving skills, and experience are all thing that are gained from faiture and can lead to success.

Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that success consists of going from faiture to faiture without loss of enthusiasm. I think that faiture Plays a crucial role during the pursuit of success.

If there were not mistakes in life. Then no one would learn from then. Faiture is unavoidable, but it can be a useful tool that helps shape your future.

My conclusion is Faiture can change who you are and what path you're on in life, and I believe that it plays an important role in the persuit for success.

Mistake only makes us smarter and working to solve problems only makes us stronger.

Without faiture, no one would be sucessful.

"Phones have come a very long way since 1973, phones have gave us the power to communicate with someone miles far away. People fell more in love with them once the first touchscreen phone came out. Now people have to have one, all you see nowadays is people walking or driving with their phone glued to their eyes. Major companies come out with a new one every year and they come out with one that has better features, a bigger screen, and a new software.

Cars have been out for many years and car accidents have happened a lot in each year. Accidents due to phone usage leads to 1.6 million deaths and that should be lowered each year. More and more people still use their phones while driving but it's a bigger percent of adults who use them while operating a vehicle. The people driving think they can multitask but imagine just driving to the store down the street and you look at your phone for a quick second, but then when you look up all you see is your life flashing in front of you. I don't think driving and using a phone is eligible at any time because driving safely is better than taking a life.

Drivers should be more cautious when driving because you never know if the person next to you is using the phone while driving. Georgia came out with a law this year where if you get caught with a phone while driving you will get a ticket. Georgia is starting to take more responsibility on the hands free law which is good because we are getting tired of hearing someone's son or daughter being ran over due to a driver not looking at the road when they need to. Adults who have been through that are probably in jail and some say they can't live with it on their conscious, they feel the pain they put the child's family through. They encourage people to please put the phone down while driving because they say it's not worth looking at a text and taking a life.

The rate of jail inmates keeps raising and in order to drop this number we as people have to encourage people to stop texting and driving. People feel bad about losing someone due to this situation but then go on the road while using the phone in an operating vehicle. Once reality hits them in that moment I think people would than start to make a change. Cars should have a sensor where if it detects that you are on the phone the car will automatically not cut on and won't let you drive until your phone is put up. If the car detects that you're on the phone while driving it will automatically pull over and cut off and won't cut on until you put it away.

That is my thoughts on driving and texting it shouldn't be allowed. Death numbers keep rising every year due to this situation and it should come to an end.",0
"660,000 drivers are attempting to use their phones while behind the wheel of an automobile texting while driving has a lot of consequences that come with it that people don't realize it serious. It only takes 5 seconds from you to look away from the road from texting while driving to get into an accident. More than 1000 teens die each year from texting while driving, 82% of adults and teens get into car accidents from other drivers texting while driving. Huntington post reported that in 2017. Parents should avoid encouraging their kids to text while driving. Texting while driving influences others to do so as well which can increase the risk of car accidents deaths every year.

Texting while driving should not be allowed because it can increase risk of car accidents which lead to people dying. According to do something. org. There are many solutions to help with not texting and driving at the same time for example turning off your notification volume another example is keep your phone in the console so it won't be a distraction. Others might say that there is nothing wrong with texting while driving because there can be an emergency, they can multi task. It is wrong because according to dosomething. org

""40% of teens say that they have been in a car when the driver used a cell phone""

Texting while driving should not be prohibited because it can increase the risk of injuries and deaths of car accidents. Many teenagers have a issue of keeping their hands off the phone including adults. Some solutions can be just to put your phone where you know you can't reach it.",0
"In the Article, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" the most major advantage citizens can have on limiting car use is taking part in keeping our Ozone safe. By constantly driving humans are making pollutions on Earth. There are many different ways these pollutions can have an effect on citizens. One being direct rays from the sunlight beaming down on the Epidermis. Another, being clouds filling up with smoke and looking dis-colored.

By walking citizens have a bunch of advantages. Excercise is a must in certain cases . Cities are embracing the fact that we can stay healthy while limiting pollution. Germany has come up with a convienent solution: build everything that is needed by citizens within walking distance. People are moving to areas like this just to get away from driving. In other places like Paris, they are creating a ban on certain days. Once Paris' smog build-up began to rise they knew something had to be done. To slove this problem drivers were to stop driving until the smog was gone. Citizens were only allowed to drive if they carpooled. Public Transportation was free for the whole week.

In Bogota, they started on this project by creating 118 miles of bicycle paths. Other cities began to get so exited that they traveled to Bogata to see the wonders of this way. The bicycle lanes have made a huge improvement on rush-hour trafic. It is said that walking would relieve stress in many areas.

Walking has also effected the American communtiy. Less cars are being bought and so are less drivers licenses being obtained as the years go by. Researchers are asking if America has passed its urge for driving peak. People that dont drive will actually hurt companies. Multi-Million dollar companies like Ford and mercedes will start to loose funds due to this decision. America is all about mobility and if this starts to decrease then so will the profit of these places.",0
"Most people think that the electoral college is not reasonable. I don't think they're wrong. The electoral college is very unfair. It is unfair because the people's votes might be overuled, the electoral college is biased, and they may not pay any attention to the people's opinions.

First of all, in some cases the popular vote might not be of any value. Besides, the popular vote doesn't matter in the decision for president it elects members for the electoral college. So if I wanted to vote for a republican president but the electoral college ends up voting for the democrat I would have wasted my time going to vote. Clearly, the electoral college's vote overrules the popular vote.

In addition to overruling the popular vote, the people on the electoral college are biased. If the people who are on the electoral college are biased then, they might not take people's votes into account to their electoral vote. I know no one would want their vote to be ignored so this is another reason why the electoral college should be abolished. If a democracy means the people decide who their leaders are, then why are there other people who might not represent the people chosing our president. Quite obviously, the electoral college is biased and might not care about the popular vote.

Furthermore, even if the people's votes go to the electoral college, the college might not even pay attention to the reasons people give to vote for someone. Most people don't really care that their votes go to deciding who is on the electoral college, but they are missing the point. The electoral college are made up of human beings and they will say no to ideas they don't like. I don't think that the fate of our country should be resting on the idea that if one person doesn't like someone they will reject the idea. Obviously, the electoral college might reject some ideas just because they don't like them.

To conclude, the electoral college cannot be trusted to decide the future of our great nation. This group of electors might be biased, their votes overrule the popular vote, and they might not be open to opinions. Consider these reasons for the electoral college not deciding the future of the United States. These people cannot be trusted to vote for our new president.",0
"Dear, state senator

I believe we should keep the Electoral College for the president of the United States.

Because it's easier to read when voting, everything is label right, and the President has alot of trust in people.

First of all, I believe we should keep the Electoral College for the president of the

United States because it's easier to read when voting. In source one, by the Office of the Federal Register, it states that ""The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President"". This shows that when all the votes are tallyed up theirs no need to go through so much problem, when their's basically a rubric to go over the electors and the electoral votes. For example, if this wasn't invented, we would have our own people just sit their on long day and nights. Without any sleep and count all those votes. This could lead to alot of miscounts. This is why I believe we should keep the Electoral College for the presidnet of the United States.

Furthermore, I believe we should keep the Electoral College for the president of the

United States because everything is label right. In source one, by the Office of the Federal Register, it states that ""Under the 23rd Amendement of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors. . . ."". This shows that whatever the 23rd Amendment is under, that's what the District of Columbia is allocated. This is just like an case at court or when you getting arrested. For example, when you are pleged guilty for murder. The judge is going to read every amendment you broke and what's your charges. And everything that's she's reading is made up. It's all labeled in United State Constitution. This is why i strongly believe we should keep the Electroal College for the president of the United States.

Lastly, I believe we should keep the Electoral College for the president of the

United States because the president has alot of people to trust in. In source one, by the Office of the Federal Register it states that ""Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors."" This shows that whoever the president of the United State is choosing for his or her own group of electors has put alot of trust on each and one of that individual. And it's time for the President to see who or who he can't put his trust in. For example, A president has alot of things that we depend on him or her to do for our Country. And the Electoral College is the best way to see if he or she could do it. This is why I believe we should keep the Electoral College for the president of the United States.

In conclusion, I strongly believe we should keep the Electoral College for the president of the United States because; One, it's easier to read when voting. If the Electoral College didn't existed their would be alot of miscounting. Second, everything is label right. Their's no need to get things from the top of your head. Third, the presdient has aot of in trust in people. Us humans gets to finally see if we could depend on him. If he choose's the right group of electors. This is why I believe we should keep the Electoral College for the president of the United States.0",0
"When you have to make a choice in a situation you don't feel confident in the situation you will ask for advice; logically speaking, the more advice you get, the better your decision will be. This can apply in scenarios of where the decision maker is in a place of discomfort, bias, or lacking the confidence.

But nonetheless, this topic can't be resolved in just a paragraph, so we will continue onward.

This can apply in scenarios of where the decision maker is in a place of discomfort.

Being selected by yourself alone can be stressful enough, but when you must make a decision about a topic you may be uncomfortable with the end results can be deafening. The amount of pressure that would be placed on that person's shoulders alone could be extremely hurtful, and if they aren't even comfortable with the topic in the beginning than they just couldn't make a clear choice

But when they are gifted compassion and advice, they will be able to make a choice that was not created through a state of panic but a state of calm.

Another way might be when the decision maker has thoughts of bias.

A biased opinion would be one that was created out of personal thoughts alone without further research, and to have those sources in order to make a decision that will effect others who disagree with it.

When two different opinions are met, they will most likely either fight for their opinion, or accept that other people are allowed to have separate opinions about certain things. A biased person will not be able to do that without help. As long as there is bias, there will be a strong lining of stubbornness that will need to be broken down by facts and reasoning. The advice given by others will eventually do so, and then the decision maker will be able to present a fair, just, and unbiased choice.

The third and final would be lacking confidence in themselves to making the possibly life-effecting choice.

The kind of things that may be racing though a their heads would make it unbearable to decade what to do, you must have full confidence in order to make a choice that is set in stone.

When you ask advice, you ask from different point of view, one that has full confidence in themselves in order to give you an honest answer. The only to learn is through experience, therefore, the decision maker figure out on their own how to gain confidence by listening to someone who has confidence and is giving them advice.

In conclusion, the best way to make a fair decision is seeking multiple opinions from others in order to make the better choice.

Through advice, people who do not feel comfortable in the situation they are in will be able to give an answer that will be worth it; people of bias will be able to see past their personal views and give an equal answer; People who are not confident enough in themselves to make an exact answer will be able to learn and use those moments of submissiveness into teaching moments. Everyone deserves to make a choice, but there are always some people who need some help discovering it.",0
"No way can that actually be made by aliens. The pictures don't lie, it is a natural mesa. We haven't even found life yet so how can we assume this is made by aliens.

The face is really just an illusion. It is just a Martian mesa with unusual shadows that, ironically, make it look like a face. We only released it to the public to get an attraction to Mars. The program didn't mean for all these conspiracies. All we wanted was some publicity for mars.

We even took another, better picture to prove it. I know not all people believe us that it isn't an alien monument. If you look at the picture though, it is clearly a natural landform. The picture was ten times sharper than the original. Still you doubt are findings about the landform.

Again, I think whole-heartedly that it is natural. You can believe what you think it is. We don't even know of life on Mars, how can aliens make it if none are even there. You can be a fool and think that it is a alien monument, but the pictures show it. It is nothing but a perfectly natural monument on the possibly populated Mars.

You may never believe me unless you go there and see it yourself. Personally it easily shows to be a natural landform. Many believe to this day that aliens made that structure and that it is impossible to have a natural sturctue of that likeness. Then again many more believe that it is perfectly natural and just an illusion.",0
"Fellow citizens there are many advantages to limitng car use. One big advantage is a reduce in global warming. Auto-moblie causes a large percent of greenhouse gas emissions as stated in source 1, paragraph 5. Limiting car usage can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than half. Car pollution can also can aslo cause smog which aslo took a toll on Paris , who had to ban driving do to smog .Due to the smog delivery companies lost revenue and public transit was free of charge for a couple of days. Smog can also travel easily to other cities throughout the air. Also car usage has taken a toll on previous bills in the united states as stted in source 1 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only the other 20 percent to other transport.

Limitng car usage can greatly reduce the number of traffic jams throughout cities. As staed in souce 4. During Bogata car-free day parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. There has been 118 miles of bicycle paths , which means more exercise which is good for your health.",0
"Why cant people make the right choice? Not everyone has the same advice or opinion as other people, by seeking more opinions people can find a better outcome. People tend to always stand by one side because they dont always see the other side of things. One person can say something completely different from the other and its all about what you chose if you chose to go with there opinion or not. when getting multiple opinions you can, find the better opinion, get a more positive outcome, and get a more opinions to pick from.

People tend to go to more then one person for advice to see what the other person thinks, some people go with just there gut or feeling but that just might not be the right way to go about things. Finding the better opinion about things is always the best way to go for anyone it can help you by helping you find the right way to go.

Getting advice from more then one person can get you a positive outcome and you can help yourself in the long run by people knowing the right opinion on things, Positive outcome can help you in the later run with other advice.

If you always only ask yourself for advice your not always going to get a positive outcome and can lead in a negative outcome. having a negative outcome can get people in a even worst spot and the advice that your getting is wrong.

By getting more opinions to pick from people can help you get the perfect advice. Getting more opinions to pick from can make your choice easier and make a better choice. The more opinions people get the more of a better choice people can make. making sure you pick the best choice you can get more opinion from other people. by getting your choice it can be hard if you just ask one person so people should at least ask 2 or more people.

It can be hard if you dont know what choice to make. By finding the better opinion on the choice your making it can overall help you and make sure you are making the right choice. talking to more then one person can give you a positive outcome on your choice. when getting more opinion from other people is can help you find the best opinion for you. when getting multiple opinions you can, find the better opinion, get a more positive outcome, and get a more opinions to pick from.",0
"Have you ever needed advice, but you didnt know which idea was best? Sometimes people ask more than one person for advice. For some people, it could be because they didnt know who had the best idea. For other people, they might not have known which was a more popular idea. Overall, asking several people for advise is better, because you get more and possibly different perspectives of peoples advice.

When people ask for advice, it is best for them to ask more people, because then they get different ideas and compare them to try to find the best. In the end, they will most likely only have one topic or choice. But before then, they would want to try and find the best ideas for what they are doing. seeking multiple opinions can help them make a better choice. After all, asking several people for advice is better, because they could get more and different perspectives of peoples advice.",0
"In ""The Chllenges of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author uses many details from the article to back this claim up.

In paragraph 8 it says that the natural human curiosity will always lead us to discover new places even if we know theres risks. it states in the paragraph that ""but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally inyimidating endevors."" we will always be looking for challenges and solutions with explorations and many other things. Also in paragraph 8 it states ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself."" This proves theres valuable informations we can learn about Venus despite the risks.

Venus at one time was also the closest thing to earth. In paragraph 4 it says ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" this is a worthy persuit because we can discover many things like how did it lose its water, did it used to have life, what event made it unhospitable, etc. To further more go into it the author says, ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" Getting to know more about Venus could possibly let us know more about Earth itself.

Lastly in paragraph 5 it says even NASA has hopes of discoverying new things about mars and maybe being able to get man on another planet. tThis would be huge for mankind. It states ""The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has one particular compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus."" Also stating imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape""

These are only ideas right now to NASA but could be a possibility to us as humans if we take risks and pursuit studying Venus despite the dangers.

To recap the author suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Theres details in the article supporting this claim. Like in paragraph 8 saying the natural human curiosity wil always push us to discover new things no matter what. Or in paragraph 4 that Venus was the most like Earth at one point of time. In paragraph 5 its an idea that we have man on Venus but that idea can be a reality in due time if we keep studying Venus. These are the details supporting the authors claim that Venus is worth pursuing despite the dangers it presents.",0
"Limiting car usage has many advantages. The most important advantage is reducing pollution. Vehicles emit greenhouse gasses from their tailpipe. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse has emissions in Europe.... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States"", as said in source one, In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.

One of the main reasons the pollution is so bad in Europe is because of the diesel fuels. According to Reuters, ""Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to 53.3 percent average in the rest of Western Europe. Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter, Brussels had 114, and London had 79.7. The numbers show that there is a direct correlation between the percent of diesel used, and the amount of pollution in an area.

Limiting car usage also helps cities grow. In Bogota, 118 miles of bicycle paths were constructed. Along with parks and sports centers blooming up, side walks have been replaced. Even new restraints and shopping districts have been built. And on top of all this, traffic has been majorly reduced. As said in the exerpt, Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota , ""These people are generating a revolutionary change."" Not only does reducing the amount of cars help the environment, it's better for your health. Pollution doesn't only affect the environment, it also damages the body. As the air gets polluted by greenhouse gas emissions, you breath in that air. And that contaminated air is the same contaminated air that is being cycled throughout our body. On top of that, reducing the usage of vehicles would force you to find a new way to get to your destination. You might resort to walking, jogging, bike riding, skating, or anything else you could think of. Limiting car usage would force you to exercise, which is obviously very beneficial to one's health.

Another advantage of limiting vehicle usage is the money that would be saved. Limiting vehicle usage would result in not buying gas as often. And as expensive as gas can get, that would would be a lot of money saved. If you went as far as selling your vehicle, there's even more money that you would benefit from.

So there are many advantages that result from limiting vehicle usage. For one, it reduces pollution, which is bad for the environment, as well as our health. Secondly, it would force us to exercise more. And lastly it would save us a lot of money.",0
"In the artilce ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus""

the writer presents the idea that though exploration of venus is dangerous it will be worthwhile in the long run. In the intro of the article the writer opens up by saying Venus is sometimes called the ""evening star"". The writer explains that the nickname given to venus came about because Venus is very easily spotted from Earth even though venus is a planet and not a star. The writer then goes on to say "" While venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely"".

Paragraph two and three expains venus is similar to earth but also how Venus is dangerous. Paragraph two opens up how Venus is often referred to as Earth's ""twin"" because of Venus is closest to earth in terms of density and size. The writer then explains how Earth, Venus, and Mars are planetary neighbors and how all three planets orbit the sun at different speeds and how sometimes how Mars will sometimes be closer to Earth and how sometimes Venus is closer to Earth. The writer then goes on to talk about how humans have sent multiple unmanned spacecrafts to venus but none have reached the surface of the planet due to the various factors that make Venus a ""challenging planet for humans to study"". Paragraph 3 explains the dangerous aspects of Venus. The writer opens up with how a ""thick atmosphere of almost nintey seven percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus"". The writer then goes on to talk about how average tempatures on Venus are over eight hundred degrees Fahrenheit and how the atmosperic pressure is nintey times greater than Earth and that these conditions are far more extreme than Earth's conditions.

Opening up paragraph four the writer asks "" if our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists evn discussing further visits to its surface?"". The writer explains that astronomers are interested by Venus because it may have once been ""the most Earth like planet in our solar system"" saying that Venus may have been once covered largely with oceans and could have supported many different forms of life. The writer then says that even now Venus still has vast surfaces of rockey sediment and includes familiar features similar to earth. The writer then makes a statement saying that "" The value of returning to Venus seems indisutable"". Paragraph 5 opens up with how nasa been discussing sending humans to Venus. The writer then goes on to talk about how in order for this idea to work nasa would have to make a special spacecraft that would have to be thirty miles above the surface of Venus. The writer then goes into specifics of how maintaining life on the spacecraft would work.

Paragraph six continues with how the spacecraft would operate. The writer then talks about how scientists would not be able to collect samples from the surface of Venus and how scientists are working on ""innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus"". Paragraph seven mainly talks about nasa and their other approches to studying Venus. The writer eplains that nasa did a experiment where electrons made of silicon carbide were tested in a chamber simulating the ""chaos of Venus's surface"". The particles only lasted three weeks. It is then explained how nasa was looking to use old technology called 'mechanical computers"". The writer eplains that these computers used gears and levers and no electronics at all. The writer then goes on to talk about how this computer would do better resistance wise in Venus's environment.

Finally in paragraph eight the writer talks about how

""striving to meet the challenges presented by Venus has value"" meaning that though it will be difficult to explore Venus it will be worth it because humanity will have more research on our sister planet along with that ""our travels should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"". This means that we should not let dangerous situations limit human exporation and evolution.",0
"Dear State Senator, While I normally don't have any complaints, and being the person I am not many things ""bug me"", but I recently found that I disagree with a certain argument. And while it is near voting times, I believed it's best for me to send you my side on this continuous debate to change your mind on the matter. The electoral college has had its share of arguments and I would like to make my side seen knowing I have quite a bit of logical arguments. Please read with an open mind.

The electoral college is unfair in many ways, this one however can be seen as minor. The electoral college gives an easier way to get tie, and although a tie hasn't been a main focus, it can prove to be a problem. I read an article stating that if a tie were to happen the election would be thrown to the house of representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. This would anger a heap of people for many reasons, one stating it would almost rule out their vote.

Secondly, the electoral college simply takes away from voting in general. An example of this is lets say Obama won popular vote, he should win because thats what America wants right? No, because what if another president won electoral vote? that president would win and take away the point in voting. This is unfair because we the people would like to have a better say in who becomes our president.

In the article I read, it stated ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. unfair, outdated, irrational"" I agree completely. How is it irrational? Well simply because it is just an extra step added on. In all reality our country would be fine without it. Popular vote is exactly what we need, and that alone is enough. And while I do believe it's good to go an extra step, it shouldn't go when not needed. This to me is most important because I could argue all day long and in the end this would be my argument.

Thank you for your time and please take this into consideration, I realize that it has its upsides but it is just unfair, outdated, and irrational. And please notice the other downsides swell, while I did not have the time or room to include them.",0
"Passenger cars are a standard method of transportation. Although, it is not the most affordable; nor is it easy to maintain. This method carries numerous disadvantages. Consequently, if citizens limit their car usage, it would be very advantageous.

Using an automobile for transportion is unethical for middle-class families. This is evident because Source 1 confirms that near French and Swiss borders, ""...a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home."" Obviously many families cannot afford to do that because more than half of Vauban's families, (Vauban is a suburb in Germany),  do not own a car and more than half had no choice but to sell theirs to move to Vauban in the first place (Source 1). Even the number of drivers in America has decreased because, during the recession, ""cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars..."" (Source 4). Sociologists also believe within the next few years, the number of car-owners will decrease because ""...the Internet...allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends."" So as the result of less car ownership, people who stopped using cars because of the recession will find less reason to resume the habit (Source 4). Clearly, limiting automobile use has positive effects because not only the middle-class, but the American population, can't afford cars.

Life without a car, environment-wise, is extremely beneficial. It is proven that automobiles are ""...a huge impediment to current efforts to...reduce greenhouse gas emissions..."" (Source 1). 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe is the result of the use of passenger cars. That percentage is up to 50% in the United States (Source 1). Because those numbers are so high, several advancements are being made to cause the percent to decrease. One example of this is, the Environmental Protection Agency's attempt to ""promote ""car reduced"" communities..."", to protect the nation's and the world's environment (Source 1). There is an environmental dilemma in Paris especially. The city has ""near-record pollution..."" and because they recognize the cause as being cars, they have enforced ""...a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" (Source 2). This ban and other efforts to preserve the environment is advantageous because it is not just an individual's home but the entire population's. Limiting car usage is a small step to making choices that will benefit citizens in the long run.

Having a limit on car use is advantageous. This is made obvious for financial reasons and environment conservation purposes. It is expensive and taxing  to use a car and the environment is better off without automobiles. Cars are not a necessity.",0
"Did you know that there are car-free cities? In the German suburbs, life goes on without cars and vehicles to use as transportataion. In the outskirts of Freiburg, a lot of things that envolve car use are forbidden. Driving in Paris is also banned because of smog. In Bogoto, Columbia, they decided to spead the Day Without Cars to local countries.

Near the French and Swiss borders, on the outskirts of Freiburg, street parking, driveways, and home garages are forbidden in the new district. On Vauban's streets, it is almost a car-free area. The only vehicle on the streets is the tram that travels to downtown Freiburg and few streets on one edge on the community. It's not like the whole idea of cars are forbidden. People are allowed to own cars but, there are only two places to park. ""They are allowed to park in large garages at the end of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home"", paragraph 2 states.

Because of the air pollution, Paris set up a partial driving ban to clear the air. On Monday, drivers with a even-numbered license plate have to leave their cars at home or pay a 22-euro fine, which is ($31). Close to 4,000 drivers were fined and 27 people had their cars impounded, due to the reaction of the fine. The good thing about it is, after the change was put into action, congestion went down 60% in the capital of France after 5 days of intensifying the smog. The idea worked perfectly fine and ended up making a great change in France and helped the environment.

During a car-free day in Bogota, Columbia, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, and took buses to work. The purpose of this action was to control pollution and avoid traffic jams. The Day Without Cars was so effective that, it began spreading to other countires. The turnout was large, people didn't even care about the weather. There were just a bunch of people working together for a good cause. The outcome took away a lot of stress and also reduced air pollution in Columbia.

Although, cars are used very often and are a useful form of transportation, they are also very hamful. Taking a break from driving isn't a bad idea. Maybe the people in Florida should consider taking action and having our own care-free day. It wouldn't hurt! If anything, i'll help!",0
"What do you do when you need advice? Many people tend to ask others such as their friends, family, teachers, etc. The real question is, should you ask only one person for advice or multiple people? Asking multiple people for their opinions can help you make a better choice as people have different views and beliefs, personal experience in what you want advice for, and you have different people telling you their opinion so you can consider the best option.

Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice, because many people have different views and beliefs. Nobody is the same, and the world is a very diverse place. Many people are biased, and if you were to ask somebody who is biased for advice, they would give you their personal opinion which could be on the far right or far left of the spectrum. Everybody was raised different. Some grew up in poverty, some rich, and some in segregated communities. The way you were brought up is also a factor to your opinions and asking just one person may affect your decision based on their opinion.

The topic you need advice on may have also happened to other people. People have personal experience in some of the same topics, and that's why it's good to seek multiple opinions. Tragic events happen to people everyday, and that's a factor in what can affect people's opinions. For example, women who have had a baby may have a different opinion than a childless woman. People are also very educated. If you needed advice on a medical topic, it would be best to go see someone who has a degree and is experienced in the field. If you were to go to your friend who self-treated them self, he or she may tell you something completely different than an experienced person in the medical field may tell you.

Multiple people telling you their opinions gives you a wide range of options to consider as they all have gone through different things in life. If it's a personal topic, it's best to ask many different people from different races, religions, and others as you'll hear many different opinions and maybe even hear something you've never thought about that you may consider.

Overall, it's best to ask multiple different people their opinions on a topic you need advice on. By doing that, you'll hear many different opinions and it'll give you a long list of options to consider as you are hearing opinions from people with different views and beliefs, personal experience, and from people who may be completely different than you.",0
"The author suggest that venus is a worthy study to study because of the goods and bad things that happens on that planet. In the paragraph it gives us examples for the good side of Venus that its earth's twin, its the second closes planet from the sun and that Mars,Earth and Venus are neighbor when it come to outter space .Next it tell us interesting facts about venus to because in the passage its tell us thing like"" A thick atomosphere of almost 97% percent carbon dioxide blank Venus''.

"Dear Senator of Florida, Though longstanding and ""fair"" to both citizens and Congress, the Electoral College is completely unnecessary and faulty. Election by popular vote is much more practical and leaves room for less errors. First off, the Electoral College warps the perception of voting, for when citizens vote, it is not directly for the president. Also, the Electoral College leaves many loopholes, which cause many issues and disputes.

To start off, the Electoral College does not allow citizens to vote directly, like a true democracy. This is unfair, unjust, outdated, and irrational. The natural right of a citizen should be to directly vote for something of a passionate matter. Controversies are everywhere, and citizens should be able to have a direct say in what is done. In What Is the Electoral College?, the Office of the Federal Register declares, ""You help choose your state's electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors"" 1.6. This seems quite indirect and faulty. Can the electors be trusted? We do not know and we definitely do not want to find out. In The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong , Bradford Plumer says, ""...according to a gallop poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"" 2.9.

Moving on, the Electoral College also contains many loopholes in the system. It is very possible to have issues arise. Electors can become faithless, the number of electors for a certain state can be controversial, and legislatures can ""defy the will of the people."" In The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong , Bradford Plumer says, ""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John. F. Kennedy. So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy"" 2.11. This unfortunate fact really shows how faulty the electoral college system really is. Do we really want so many loopholes when it comes to choosing the person who will run our country?

One may say that the electoral college has less disputes than that of just the popular vote. In In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president , Richard A. Posner says, ""A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible it happened in 2000 but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote"" 3.18. However, this is untrue in my opinion. The Electoral College has already created so much controversy and dissension, along with faults and problems. For the wellbeing of our country, it would be best to simply get rid of the Electoral College alltogether.

Overall, the Electoral College should not exist choosing the president should rely on simply the popular vote. The Electoral College is not a direct way for citizens to vote, which shows signs of America not being a true democracy. Also, the Electoral College has many loopholes that are sources of dispute and issues in America. To sum it up, this method of choosing the president, is irrational, unfair, unjust, and outdated. The Electoral College should be abolished.",0
"As technology advances in a very constant and remarkable fasion, many new innovations begin to reveal themselves. While we still might be waiting for the next flying car or teleporter, several smaller, yet very significant, inventions have presented themselves. An example of this is a computer software that is able to identify and recognize emotions. Profesor Thomas Huang from the Beckman Institute for Advance Science at the Univeristy of Illinois created this software in hopes of changing the world for the better, but is it really that great? Among the several other practical uses, Huang says that the use of this technology in the classroom can be the most important. Overall the use of emotional recognition has the potential to be useful due to the ability to change the lesson based on mood, and alter mood based on the current your current status, but overall would not be 100% effective due to the spiratic qualities of humans.

Dr. Huang, the inventor of the emotional recognition, claims there could be huge advancements in the education system due to his new technology. In a time of computer screens, video games, and the newest iphone students have trouble beign lectured for six hours a day. Dr. Huang's main goal is to put a computer with the lesson plans and his software in front of a computer so that it can do the teaching, effectivly. If a student begins to get bored and their zygomatic major muscles begin to relax and visibly show the boredom setting in, Dr Huang's computer software would be able to recognize and alter the lesson to be more engaging to the student. This would easily work for many other situations, if a student is sad the lesson could use brighter colors and better diction to create an enviorment where the student is not distracted and wants to learn. Nick D'Alto describes a situation where a student becomes very confused and does not know what they are doing and how to do it, but with the use of Dr Huang's technology the lesson could be changed and break down to easier steps to correctly compensate for the confusion.

Overall, the use of Dr. Huang's software to change a lesson would be very useful in improving the learning enviorment for the students who will go on to create equally as innovative new mechanism in the future.

Secondly, the software can be used to help change the mood of a student in order to boost morale as well as create an enviorment where the student wants to learn. In this day and age there are so many things for a student to be passionate about, such as: sports, video games, friends, and so much more. This is very good in the sense of passion but ultimately takes away from the desire to learn and become successful in school. Often times a student comes into school with the worst mood possible, hating every second of it, but Dr. Huang could change things up. For example if a student comes into school angry Dr. Huang's facial coding system would be able to create an enviorment where the lesson becomes more like a game for the student to play and enjoy while at the same time learning the content.

If a student comes into school depressed, it could be the job of the system to recognize this, notify someone, and help them be happy.

Dr. Huang's invention creates a short cut in seeing how someone feels through science. At times people are too afraid to ask ,""Are you okay?"". The use of this software can go straight to the aiding of someone without even having to think twice. In the end, emotions create roadblocks for students to learn and the use of Dr. Huang's technolgy can identify and help break them down so that a kid can be a normanl kid again.

Although Dr. Huang's software is extremly useful, things can often be a little more complicate than what technology can actually be good for. While the identifying of emotions is very useful, the actual action of neutralizing them can be beyond the machine. For example, if a student is crying their eyes out with no sign of stopping, I am pretty sure a change in the lesson will not help calm that student. If a student is so mad that they just want to break the computer and storm off, no change in the lessons music, colors, or diction is going to be able to fix that. In general an actual human is what each student needs to be there for them. The warmth of a hug or simple hand on the shoulder can change the outlook on a students entire emotional status. The fact that an actual teacher cares is more than enough to allow the teacher to keep teaching. Overall Dr. Huangs software is incredibly useful to identify emotional change but really can not help deal with most situations like a teacher would.

In conclusion Dr. Huang's software holds its value in it's ability to read emotions and alter the lesson as well as alter the mood of a student in need, but is very limited in how it can help a student get through their troubles. The use of Dr. Huang's technolgy in the classroom will definately lead to advances in student comprehension but for the many individuals that need more than a computer for sypathy, the program most likely will not work.",0
"Imagine a world without any cars, people riding their bicycles and gaining more contact with the world, being able to excrises everyday, having less stress in life, and so on. There is so many advantages with limiting that amount of cars usage like being able to save money due to all the things that go along with having a car that you wouldn't have to pay anymore. There is also the fact that you will able to reduce your stress levels. The reduction of pollution from that cars will also be a advantage from limit ed usage of cars. There are so many ways to get yourself from point A to point B, why would you choose a negative one.

Money is tight in today's economy, so why won't you choose to save it and still be able to get to your destination. In Vauban, Gemany, Resident are expected to pay 40,000 dollars in order to park a car.

In Paris, you would have to pay a 22-euro, or 31 dollars fine depending what day it is inorder",0
"Asking for Advice

Sometimes when asking for advice, it is hard to know exactly who you can go to depending on the situation. Not everyone has been through the same thing that you're going through, so some people wouldn't know what advice to give you. That's why it is a better idea to talk to multiple people about your problems or situations.

Many different people have many different experiences. Some may know more than others, and some may be wiser than others. You can get more advice by talking to multiple people. They could give you different and better ways to handle the situation. Not everyone is going to have the same opinion of course, but that's up to you to figure out and decide which way you think is better to help your situation.

Talking to multiple people about your problems not only gives you more advice, but it makes you feel so much better! I know when i'm upset, talking to someone about it makes me feel a lot better. I know some people have trouble opening up to others. A lot of people have trust issues and don't know how to talk about there problems, but getting things off of your chest relieves so much stress. It's healthier for yourself to talk to people about how you feel and not keeping everything trapped inside of your head.

There are many different people that you can go to for advice. Talking to people who are older and wiser than you are is probably the better way to go. People you could talk to could be a close family member, a trusted teacher, your school councilor or any of your friends may be helpful too. At least one of them is going to know how you feel and how to help you. You're not alone and you have people to talk to. You might not know them very well, but that doesn't mean they can't still help you.",0
"Driving Distracted

Many drivers usually text and drive even if it's just to change a song. During this time one can easily become distracted from the road. This is how accidents occur and there are some who use their phone constantly and don't see a problem. Drivers should not be allowed to use their phones while driving.

When people are driving and receive a notification or a call on their phone the first thing they might do is check it. This can cause many problems as in that second that you are looking at your phone you can become easily distracted. This is how most accidents occur. Also when the driver begins to text and drive their focus is on what there texting instead of the road. In that time that you are looking at your phone you can hit a pothole or simply lose control of the vehicle endangering you and the other people on the road. There are also people who when they begin to text and drive they take their hands off the steering wheel. This is extremely dangerous because if the car begins to swerve you will have a delayed reaction and less time to react.

Laws have been implemented as to stop the use of phones while driving. In Georgia a law was implemented called the hands free which means while driving you may not use anything that may distract you. These laws have good intentions but many simply choose to ignore them. Even with these laws accidents still occur because of phones many just simply don't care. When people ignore these laws they need to be enforced better as many still text and drive. Even with laws in place many will text and drive and not care for others or themselves.

There are some uses for phones while driving but one should never text and drive. The main use for using a phone while driving is to use the gps. Using a gps does not require for you to be texting and driving if you set the destination beforehand. You can also simply put your phone in a do not the disturb so that you will not become distracted or turn your phone off. There are also apps to help you limit the use of texting and driving as you can make your phone not receive messages while you are driving.

Even with laws or apps many will still text and drive. This still causes many problems as you are not only endangering you but the people around you. Phones should only be used for directions while driving or not at all. Stricter laws should be imposed so people won't text and drive. Drivers should not be allowed to use their phones while driving.",0
"Dear state senator, There has been an ongoing conflict on the matter of the proper method to use when deciding on a president: use of the electorsal college, or popular vote. I believe that this should be looked upon in greater concern than it currently is. Not only do many people question this argument, but they feel uncomfortable by it too. I believe the electorsal college should be taken away from the process. This is a more secure way of voting because the people of this nation feel as if whom ever they vote for may not actually be voted for by the electorss. And this is, in no way, a good thing for the nation.

In the first place, the electorsal college has its flaws, as anything would. But it's these flaws that the popular vote dosen't have that makes it a less valid way to decide something as important as presidency. The electorsal college has a seemingly fair way of deciding such a thing. Each state is given a certain number of electorss to represent its population Ex. A small state such as Maryland would have less electorss than California. It seems alright, until you realize how unfair it really is... In one way, though rare, the electorss may switch outlook, and end up voting for the opposite candidate than whom they were voted, in turn, to vote for. Some even choose at random who they will vote for, regardless of who they were supposed to choose. Which then leads to the unfair decision for however many people he or she represented.

Not only does it have the unfair use of electorss, but it also is much more imprecise than popular voting methods. While the electorsal college, in total, has only a couple hundred votes, it is less rational than the millions upon millions of people across the nation wanting to vote for whoever they wish with the use of the popular vote method. In ' The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong', the author explains, in paragraphs 4 and 5, how in the case of a tie in the electorsal vote, that ""the Houses selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people."" Meaning that no matter what the people think, the president shall be chosen for them. And this is not the right way to elect the person designated to run the country.

In my final point, as not to bore you with countless others, the use of popular vote has already surpassed the electorsal college votes, as such in the case of Nixon is Kennedy, but has not proven enough to win the election. How is that fair, on any level? It shows how most people voted for one candidate, but then have that candidate lose because of the electorsal college. Is that not reason enough, to show that people wanted a certain person as president, but because of the electorsal college, didnt get as they wanted nor deserved? Not only is it shown in basic reasoning, but it is also shown in the numbers. The electorsal college is an unjust way to elect presidents.

I hope this is enough to change your view on the electorsal college. It is not the fair way to let the people of this nation have the leader they want and and rightfully deserve. The use of popular vote is. It not only is a direct line of voting from the people, but all in all has a much fairer way to total the votes. A vote itself cannot possibly change from the point it is written to the point when it is accounted for, but an electors can. Don't allow this to happen the next term. And i speak for most of the people in the U.S.",0
"People think about today's world as the era of technology constantly advancing and creating new ideas beneficial to us all. But are they really benefiting all of us? That's where the car comes in. Automobiles are one of the highest polluting machines out there. People are constantly worrying about greenhouse gas emissions while they use their cars consistently. Now, when us stubborn Americans try to imagine a life without cars, we immediately oppose the idea. But can you blame us? Society has been built upon the idea of cars since World War II. Cities are so widely spread out that the mear thought of walking or biking to the nearest shopping mall makes you appreciate your car even more. It could take a matter of time before any civilization modernizes into a carfree society.

But people must realize what the real matter here is less driving equals a healthier planet. Think all of how much less pollution would be around if people did not use their cars so religiously. Our earth is sacred. If we continue to destroy it with fossil fuels and car exhaust, there will not be anything left for generations to come.

Not only would the environment improve drastically, but people would also save money from not having to buy gas! If you pay 3.50 for a gallon of gas, that can add up extremely quick. Imagine all the alternatives you could use that money for instead of gas. Why pay for oil when you can simply ride a bike for free? Biking and walking rather than driving is much healthier for your physical state as well. Altogether, people will be much happier and at a better state of mind with cars banished from every day life.

As you see in cities such as Seattle, Washington for example hardly anyone owns a car. The people have revolutionized into using the trains. The subways create less smog, more efficient car pooling, and will still get you to your destination in a blink of an eye. Seattle is a booming city, teaming with life. If that is not proof of sufficient life without cars, then I do not know what is.

Humans' lives revolve around automobiles. Just think about your average day. I can guarantee you spend a good amount of time driving hastily around town trying to get to your many destinations. This can be stressful. As stated in one of the articles above, a media trainer and mother of two who resides in Vauban, Germany, a carfree city, said, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Nobody wants to spend their evenings in their car while they could be spending quality time with their family, but that seems to be the way everyone lives nowadays.

A carfree world is the ideal society us as people should strive for. There are extinential benefits to life without automobiles and many downfalls to life with automobiles.",0
"Every four years there is an election. The election is used to decide who our president will be for the next four years. The Electoral College is currently being used for our elections. The articles ""Does the Electoral College Work?"" and ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard Posner believes the Electoral College should continue to stay in use. On the other hand, the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer believes that the Electoral College should be removed from the system of electing the President. While the Electoral College has been in use for a majority of the time, it is time to start a different process called popular vote.

The Electoral College has been in place for many years and has produced good results. One good thing the Electoral College does is it prevents a candidate from becoming President if they only have regional appeal. This is crucial because ""a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president"" Posner. With the Electoral College in place it makes it impossible to for a candidate with only regional appeal to become president because no region has enough electoral votes to elect them. Another helpful thing the Electoral College does is it has a certainty of outcome, so it is less likely for disputes than popular votes. It is less likely for disputes because ""the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote"" Posner. Even if a state has a few more votes for the Electoral College it still creates a huge victory. Even though the Electoral College has produces some good results, presidents being elected through popular vote will be better, more efficient, and more equal.

Again, the popular vote will be more fair. It will be more fair because a president with more popular votes will win. In the Electoral College, a candidate with the most popular votes does not ensure victory because the other candidate may have more electoral votes. This happened in 2000 when Al Gore got more popular votes, but lost the presidency Plumer. The Electoral College is not fair to the citizens of this country and to the candidates. If more people prefer one candidate over the other, then the president should clearly clearly be them. The Electoral College is also not fair because if there is a tie, then the vote goes to the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives' ""selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people"" Plumer. The majority of the House of Representatives is Republicans, so the president elected will be reflected by that, and it will not give the Democrats equal representation. All in all, popular vote should be used to determine the President because it is a more fair and an equal way to do so.

Equally important, popular vote should be used to elect the President because then candidates and voters will pay attention to the campaign. With the Electoral College candidates only spend time trying to win the votes of the ""swing states."" They will not pay attention to the states that they already know have their vote. In fact, in the 2000 campaign, there were seventeen states that the candidates never visited. Two of those are Rhode Island and South Carolina Plumer. Every state should be able to see the candidates so the voters get to really know who they are voting for, so they will make a better decision. Also, with the Electoral College people in states that know their vote will not matter will not pay attention to the campaign. A person such as, a ""Republican in California... have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote"" Posner. Everyones opinion should matter and should be taken into account when electing the President. To summarize, popular vote is the only way to ensure that the voters get all the knowledge they need to elect the President, and so that everyone's vote matters.

In conclusion, electing the President is a painstaking task and should be done using popular vote, not the Electoral College. The President of the United States plays an important role in our country. The President has to make many difficult decisions, and those decisions should be a reflection of the entire country. It should not just reflect the certain states that contributed their electoral vote.",0
"Dear Senator Adams,

Voting for a president is not what it seems to be. The electoral college makes the people's votes so that the electors are actually voted. These electors vote for the president in favor of their party which is not always trustworthy or reliable. The popularity winner can also lose, due to lack in electoral votes. Many voters are still confused or don't know how the system works. In reality, electoral system is outdated and should be tweaked of how it would work today.

To begin with, Electors that are voted for by the people are not always trustworthy. They're hand picked by their politcal party but sometimes,""-state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsiblilties are...""(Does The Electoral). Voters can't control who their electors vote for president. The electoral college should be changed to popularity votes because, ""-(the) electors could always defy the will of people""(The Indefensible Electoral). This is unreliable and the way of voting by the people can be easily swayed by the electors.

Additionally, the popularity winner can lose by having less electoral votes. Voters can be discouraged to elect their president when really the electors do the job. This situation has happened when,""-Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes-""(In Defense Of). Any election, voters can expect another close election in which the popular winner could again lose the presidency. The electoral college is unstable and this major downside is a factor.

More over, many voters are still confused or don't know how the system works. In this article it states that, ""-voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate""(The Indefensible Electoral). The electoral college does not clarify to voters on what the people are actually voting for. In another article it explains that people actually voted for a slate of electors. This would mean that the author had to reassure the right understanding. Readers of that article who've voted are now in disbelief or shocked.

In conclusion, the electoral college should be addressed to a win by popularity. The electors in favor of their political party are not always trustworthy. The popularity winner can lose due to lack in electoral votes. Also, many voters are confused or don't know how the electoral college works in presidential elections. These facts add on to more cons than pros of the idea of electoral college.",0
"The Facial action coding system is a good move to a higher level of schools. The Facial action coding system is going to make students emotion more valuable. The Facial action coding system well make the teachers know how their students feel about the class which is the most important thing to know. Are they bored, happy, disgusted, or angry.

Why is it important to the teachers to know how their students feel about the class? It's important because mostly the way a student feel about a class is what going to make him/her pass or fail that class. If the teachers knew their students feelings they well have a chance to change their students feeling. That's what well make all the teachers ""the best teacher.""

In conclusion the Facial action coding system is a good move to a higher level of schools. The Facial action coding system is going to be very helpful for teachers too. Finaly I think that the Facial action coding system is going to be one of the most valuable things in schools.",0
"There is absolutely no way that the ""face"" on Mars was made by aliens. Some people and very few scientists think this landform was made by aliens on Mars. When you think about it,it is not logical. If there were aliens on Mars scientists and NASA would of known about them by now and would of informed us. They have up to date technology now and would of detected a living thing on Mars if there was anything there,which there isn't.

Some people say that NASA and scientists are trying to keep the aliens a secret and keep them from us but there is no reason to. I think if there were aliens on Mars they would of let us know because it would be a bigger benefit for them because people would want to see them and pictures of them. They could get a lot of money so it doesn't make sense for them to hide them from us. Also the ""face"" became a priority to them and they took many photos and did a lot of research about it. The most logical answer is that the ""face"" is just a natural landform or rock formation made by nature. The eyes,nose,and mouth are formed by clouds that give an illusion.""What the picture really shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa,lanforms common around the American West,"". It is a coincidence that is resembles a face but that doesn't mean it was made by aliens.

There is no reason for people not to believe scientists or NASA because there is no evdience that the ""face"" was made by aliens or that NASA and the scientists are lying to us. Everything about it is not logical and does not make sense,if there were any actual life on Mars we would of know by now. It is just a rock formation and shadows that is tricking the human eye.",0
"Have you ever been in a situation where you couldn't decide what to do? Maybe you asked a friend or family member for help. Asking for advice is one of the best things a person can do when faced with a difficult decision. When asking for advice, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because it helps them see all sides of the situation, it makes them aware of all the possible options, and it helps them not make a decision based on bias.

When making a choice, it is always good to think about things from all sides of the situation. Different people have different points of view, and will see the situation differently depending on their background or personal experiences. Asking multiple people for their opinion helps to give one a wide range of viewpoints to help them make a good decision. For example, suppose a student was deciding if they wanted to take all honors classes in high school. Instead of asking just one person for their opinion, they could gather more information about the honors program from all points of view and then make their choice. They could ask an older sibling who is in honors and loves it, and also their friend who is taking the same classes and struggling in order to see all of the pros and cons and decide if it is right for them. Seeking multiple opinions will show you all points of view and help you make a more educated decision.

Asking for multiple opinions makes one aware of the different possible options. When someone asks a person for their opinion, that person they ask will have in their head one option that to them is the right option. However, the right option for them may not be the right option for someone else. Asking for multiple opinions ensures that a person learns about all of the possible options and their outcomes and effects. There is one very common real world example of this. When people go to the doctor and are diagnosed with a condition, they often ask for a second or even third opinion. They want to be absolutely certain that the diagnosis is correct, and that they receive the medical care and medication that is right for them. Different doctors will have different treatment plans, and going to multiple doctors makes one aware of all the possible actions they can take, and helps them decide which is best for them.

When giving advice, people are often biased. Asking for multiple opinions can help prevent one's decision from being affected by bias. In the same way that getting your news from only one channel will give you only that channel's biased spin on events, asking only one person for advice gives you only one opinion, which may be affected by bias. Asking multiple people gives you multiple opinions to decide from, and you will avoid making a decision based on one person's biased point of view. For example, let's say your family was deciding what type of pet to get, By asking just your dog owning neighbor for advice, you'll get his biased opinion on why dogs make the best pets. By asking a variety of people who own a variety of animals, you will ensure that the choice you are making is not entirely based on the bias of one person. Or suppose someone is deciding who to vote for in an election. Asking a friend that supports one candidate will give them that one biased point of view, but by asking multiple friends with different viewpoints they can decide for themselves which candidate they prefer.

In conclusion, looking for more than one opinion can help a person make a better decision. One example of this in my experience was when my family was deciding on which orthodontic practice to take me and my siblings to to get braces. Instead of going to one orthodontist office and then stopping there, we went to multiple places to hear what their plan and prices were before making a final decision. Because we went to multiple practices and got multiple opinions, my family was able to make the decision that is right for us. When making a decision, seeking multiple opinions will always help someone make a better choice.",0
"I disagree, I feel that the Mona Lisa wasnt really expressing 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry, she looked like she was just posing for a picture or to be drawn, you cannot just look at somebody and tell what kind of emotions their expiriencing even if you do studies, it could just be thats how she is as a person all the time. The author uses facial feedback theory of emotion, saying not only does moving your facial muscles just express emotions , it may also even help produce them. They say that faces dont lie but anyone can fake emotions she was just taking a photo or was posing to be drawn they could have just made a conclusion stating she was 100 percent happy, I mean she was being drawn which means she must have been one of the best looking women around or something was good about her and only her, and her face drawing is now one of the most known pieces of art ever created. In the drawing it looks like shes outside so it could be the lighting or something around her that is causing her face to look like that. Its also hard to tell what kind of emotions shes having because she doesnt have eyebrows, the reason I say that is because most people raise or lower their eyebrows when they are trying to make their emotions noticable, so the main thing people can see about her emotions are her lips they look happy but its like a half smile, but the writer claims she is 83 percent happy, it seems much less than that. Her eyes look like she is staring at someone, not dissapointed.",0
"The Electoral College should stay because it lets other people choose the president on behalf of the people. The Electoral College helps so that there is not a big problem with people going and having to do all that work themselves. Some people dont like having to vote the way the Electoral College does so they just take the majority vote and puts that in for us so we dont have to do it. It lets us choose and go home so that were not goin out all day waiting for so many people to do the majority now its all online which makes it even easier to tally it all up and see who gets the vote.

The Electoral College is just making everything alought easier for us and we are able to spend less time in a voting area waiting for people to get done. The online voting helps out alought because we are able to get everything done a whole lot easier then others. There is also a smaller line with the online thing so that most people dont have to wait as long. Unless you get that one person who is taking forever and doesnt want to leave the booth then you are there all day and nobody wants that to happen because that would not leave you having a good day for nobody.

But the majority vote could be good to only having to split up the vote and the president is whoever got the most votes. But the only outcome of that is someone not liking the president or the president isnt doing very well in anything and he just sits there not doing anything. Then that president would have to be impeached and we will have to get a new president and nobody wants to go through that. Some people might want to go through that and get a new president only because they dont like him or hes not doing to well in anything or he is just a stoubern president and doesnt like makeing rash decisions. But that president is going to have to get over that.",0
"I am going to prove that the face you saw on the planet is not a alien and that it is a natrual landform. On May 24,2001,""NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet,snappin photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2,when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormos head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the camreas from region of the Red Planet called Cydonia.""This shows how it all started.""A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head..formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose,and mouth.""The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attenion to mars.""This shows that everyone is going to go back and forth about if its a alien or a landform.""And so on April 5,1998,when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time,Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC)team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the orignal Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site,reavaling...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. This shows that ther was no alien face in the planet in the first place and that it was a landform the whole time.",0
"By reading this article I would be in no doubt certain that using FACS (Facial Action Coding Systme) for the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. It could keep the attention of the students inside a classroom.

In paragraph 6 it mentions why FACS is a good and helpful tool to use inside a classroom. According to Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Adanced Science at the Unversity of Illinois, ¨A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,¨ Dr. Haung also goes on and predicts ¨Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.¨ By Dr. Haung telling us this information it shows us that by using FACS our students may pay better attention in class becuase they are not confused nor bored. Another reason why using FACS is important is because it has the potential in increase the students intelligence.

In conclusion, FACS is a good and helpful advancement in techology that could one day be in schools everywhere. It would make school less boring and could keep the attention of the students inside the classroom.",0
"The face on Mars is just a landform. There is no such thing as aliens. Alson there is no life of any type that can live on Mars. ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform.""

The picture shows us a part of Mars where the face is just form in that weird way. Makin people think there was aliens on Mars. Mars is not a liveable place. There is no air to breathe, and it is to hot. You wouldn't make it alive in Mars, because you would lose your breath and burn up.

All the picture is show us is that a natural landform has formed on Mars. It is a great picture off landform you might never see again, but it has nothing to do with aliens on Mars. If aliens were real, one of

NASA'S scientists would have found them in outer space by now. The face is just a great form of natural landform.",0
"The time of the founding fathers is long gone. Times have changed which means we have to change our way of thinking. Our way of voting. The Electoral college needs to be replaced by popular vote elections because the Electoral College discourages people from voting for their preferred president, influences future presidents to ignore some states, and does not clearly reflect the views of the American people.

Initially, by keeping the Electoral College individuals are less incentivized to vote if they know there is little chance it will do anything. ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election"" Source 3, 23. However, by implementing popular vote, many more people will want to vote knowing that even if their side does not get the majority vote in the state, it still counts for something. Also, from that same source it says ""The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense."" Source 2, 15. So one would have to ask if the source is even reliable if it contradicts itself. In addition, even if they usually vote ""candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states."" source 2, 13. This shows that states with more electoral votes will have more power over the people. Clearly, the Electoral College is a problem and popular vote is a much better way to vote.

Furthermore, because some states old more power than others wen it comes to elections, presidents often ignore the ""smaller"" states looking only for votes. For example, ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" Source 2, 13. Candidates are not interested in the states, in the people, who do not give them enough votes. This is why the Electoral needs to be abolished and replaced with popular vote elections.

Moreover, just because a president wins the campaign, does not mean that the candidate won the people's votes, it only means that he won the Electoral College's votes. For example, in the 2000 election and the 1888 election, one party won even though majority of the votes went to the other. In the 2000 election, even though Gore had more popular votes than Bush, he still lost because he had fewer electoral votes. This shows that there is something broken in the system. Something that can't be changed and needs to be replaced. As you can see, popular votes are the way to go in such an important election like the presidential one with so much on the line.

In conclusion, the Electoral college needs to be replaced by popular vote elections because the Electoral College discourages people from voting for their preferred president, influences future presidents to ignore some states, and does not clearly reflect the views of the American people. The Electoral College might have been good in the past however, now it just complicated the process and is unfair.",0
"Smog. Gas. Pollution. Many countries dont allow for people to have cars because they destroy the air that they are breathing. People and animals become sick from there being an abundance of pollution in the air that they are breathing. Another factor that can be taken into consideration is that it can reduce the amount of traffic jams as well. Do you think that the community that you live is effected by the pollution from cars.

To start off, many districts are forbidding people have cars. In places near French and Swiss boreders, citizens are forbidden from parking on streets, driveways, and home garages. Citizens say that they feel less tense and happier without having their car. Source 1 states that "" Vauban is seperating surburban life from auto use as a component of ""smart-planning."" In Elisabeth Rosenthal's passage it says that ""Passenger cars are responisble for 12%(percent) of greenhouse gass emissions in Europe..... and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States. In Europe forbidding car use it is drastically reducing greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. Over the past couple of decades, maybe even centries we have been centered around the automobile that has effected out health and daily lives because of the increase of pollution.

Also, the streets in Europe are not as crowded as the streets in the United States. Paris, more smog than any other European capital, has began to enforce a partial banning of cars to help clear the cities air. Cars that run off of diesel gas tend to create more pollution than cars that run off of regular gas. Sixty-five percent(%) of France's vehicles are fueled with diesel gas. By limiting the usage of these cars they will be contributing to the decrease of gas in the air. The increase of pollution has created a solution to help and decrease polluted air by making plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars that are able to transport more than one person at a time. Records and studies show that Beijing,China is one of the many polluted cities in the world.

Another fact that is an advantage of limited car usage is little to no traffic jams. In Colombian millions have began the day without cars where they use alternative forms of transpotation such as walking, biking, skating, and riding buses. ""Day with out Cars"" has promoted the use of alternative forms of transportation and smog reduction. Since adults children and teens have reduced the limit of car usage the Mayor of Mockus has began the construction process of an 118 miles of bicycle paths, new parks, sidewalk, restaurants, and upscale shopping districts have been created for them to go to on their free time.

Many people have began to not be as interested in driving because gas prices, as well as pollution. Their are many advantages to not limiting the usage of the automobile. It has reduced the amount of money that we spend, pollution and much more is also has helped us notice that there are alternatives to driving a car such as walking, riding the bus, and bike riding. You are also able to interact more with friends because the topic of car pooling has became very important and noticable.  Those are just a hand full of ideas and ways that limiting the usage of cars is effective.",0
"For decades, society has put a major emphasis on transportation in order to center themselves around cars and ways to upgrade them. However, it is this frame of that mind that has created issues for modern society. If there were limitations put on the usage of cars, then those rules would help maintain the environment, save car owners money, and create a feeling of bliss and serenity that has disappeared since the mass production of cars. So unless change is brought upon society, then people will be passing up on benefits that would better the whole world.

Scientist have long realized that cars are a major cause to the pollution brought into society. From the waste produced while turning precious oil into gasoline, to the engines in millions of cars simultaneously burning gas. It is for this reason that limiting the use of cars would assist in saving and maintaining the environment. According to Robert Duffer, the author of the article ""Paris Bans Driving Due to Somg"", ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog."" What is also noteworthy is that this experiment by France officials was only in place for a matter of days. So after having smog that repotedly rivaled Beijing, China, the smog capital of the world, the smog that inhabited France was more than cut in half. If this can work in such a large scale like France, then it isn't unreasonable to believe that this same process can be done in other major regions. Saving the environment has become a priority around the world in recent years, and the idea of limiting the usage of cars could help to achieve that goal.

Aside from the fact that the limitation of cars can save the environment, it can also save car owners money. When a person stops at a gas station to fill up their car, they can expect to spend between twenty and fifty dollars. However, if cars were to become less relevant, then this money can be used to fund other important aspects of a persons life. While this might seem farfetched, according to Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, ""the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter."" This analysis helps to justify the fact that cars can eventually become less relevant and thus save people money. Also, money would be saved on not having to repair and maintain a car, or having to buy a car in general. This alone can save a carowning household thousands of dollars each year.

Saving the environment and money are always an obvious choice when explaining the benefits of limiting car usage, but another benefit would be obtaining bliss and serenity around the globe. Since the mass producion of cars, cities are always filled with the irritating sounds of a lively road. This has left many people to enjoy their walks, not to the sounds of children laughing and people conversing, but to the beeping and screeching of cars. However, in a city in Germany called Vauban, officials have successfully created a peaceful city that relies on walking and public transportation instead of cars. According to Heiden Walter, a media trainer and citizen in Vauban, ""When I had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" This quote goes to show that the citizens don't feeled resticted, but released from their reliance on cars. So although it may seem difficult, putting limitations on cars can create a happier populants.

Putting a limitation on the use of cars would not be a punishment like some would see it, but a way to better society. This limitation would help save and maintain the environment, save car owners money, and create bliss and serenity amongst people. As modern society continues to push forward and develop the next wave of advancements, putting limitations on the use of cars should be seen as a serious inquiry to leaders around the world.",0
"Drivers should be able to use phones while driving. Even though texting while driving is against the law people have invented apps and devices that allows you to use the phone without actually holding the phone in your hand they have phone holders and aux cables.

Even if your not allowed to hold your phone while driving to change the music or change the call you can now use an aux or voice activated command like siri or alexa. Which would make it safer to use your phone while driving and not having to your phone

Most people nowadays still drive while texting on the phone I know my older brother and my God dad do it all the time. I sometimes wonder if im supposed to say something about them driving while on the phone.

Using phones while in the car can be a good thing in the since that in case of emergency and you aren't able to reach your phone with your hand you can use voice activation to call the police or fire department. See most people don't take advantage of phone holders while driving because its an hasil to hook to the air vent but if it's going to keep me out of jail I would use one. So in the end cell phones should be allowed to be used in any capacity while operating any vehicle.",0

"Many citizens in the United States rely on cars as a way of transportation. What they don't realize is that there are multiple options to consider instead of a car. ""Why consider a new method of transportation?,"" you may ask. If we limited the car usage we would have great amounts of advantages as a result.

One important result that would come if we limited car usage is having nearby store locations near by. "" In this new approach stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in a malls along some distant highway.""Source one: In german Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars paragraph six Limiting car usage will result in new buildings, stores, houses to become at a fair enough distance to walk.

If we had stores nearby enough to walk, there's no need of a car. If car usage reduces, the amount of walking, or riding a bike would increase. This will lead to a better life style. Recent studies has showed that walking daily can improve a persons mind. ""When I had car i was always tense, I'm much happier this way."" Source one: In German Suburb, Life goes on Without Cars paragraph three.

Another major positive affect that will result in reducing car usage is improving our atmosphere. One disadvantage cars cause, is air pollution. One example would be smog. The smog that we breath in is not good for our health.""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""Source threeparagraph twentyfour. Not only if we reduce car usage we would gain positives outcomes but we would reduce pollution.

""Passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emmisons in Europe...and up to fifty percent in some carintensive areas in the United States."" Source one paragraph five. We would be doing positive thing for ourself but a positive thing for the environment.

Our generation does not need to rely on a piece of mechanic to take them to their destination. We have the ability to get to our route, and have other options that are helpful for us and for our environment. We have multiple advantages if we would consider to reduce car usage. So the question would be, why dont we stop using cars, and start helping ourself and our environment knowing the advantages we could be recieving in return.",0
"When people in a group share ideas it will make them find an idea easier. I think that the best way to find ideas is by doing a group project and taking time to talk about your ideas as a group. Also when talking to other people you could think of stuff that no one has thought of before something completely new.

First off, when you work in a group but you don't talk over ideas you are in a lot of trouble. So if you are doing a group project for science where you have to think of a design and you personly does not have any ideas you and your group partners can talk about an idea and all togeither can settle on one. Also talking about ideas will also make it easier to complete the project too. Also even if you are doing a project by yourself you can still go to the other groups and ask what they are doing and without sealing their idea you can get ideas of your own.

Secondly, when you talk about ideas with more than one person you will be able to talk to people better. If you are a shy and quiet person and you work in a group you will gain better people skills because you are telling other people your ideas and hear other ideas from a couple of differant people. Also if you are a quiet person and you work in a group and you tell people your ideas you will see that your ideas are good and aren't bad. Also when you are telling people ideas if you don't have many friends you can make friends by telling your ideas and hearing theirs you can see if you and them think the same.

Thirdly, if you are in a group and you are having trouble desiding on a final desion you can always combined the ideas to make one big group idea. Also if your group is having trouble coming up with an idea you can have a group descution with your teacher so you and your group can come up with an idea faster ecspecily if you are falling behind compaired to the other groups. If you and your group are having trouble coming up with ideas you could also watch Youtube to get insperation or you could after school go on a walk and see if you get ideas from nature.

In conclusion, if you are working in a group doing a project and you need ideas talking about ideas is the best way to go.",0
"I think that the new software, the Facial Action Coding System, is actually amazing and wierd at the same time. It can be interesting towards some people and not to other because it can make people feel uncomfortable.

Read peoples emotions without the persons consent might make them feel quite vulnerable or uncomfortable. Dr, Eckman has only classified six basic emotions. Happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness were the six emotions. I think that are more than just six basic emotions that need to be taken into consideration. I do agree when Dr. Haung said, ""Even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression."" Caculating the extent of someones real emotion or expression is very difficult for trained professionals to actually get how a person might be feeling, so how can a computer know? I think just by measuring the persons muscles on their face it can just be a fake smile just looking like a real smile. Using this technology in different locations and settings could be very helpful. If the prodect accuratly can measure exactly how a person might be feeling. They could use it in law inforcment to caculate sadness, happiness, being suprised, or being nervous. When the article says, ""While looking in the mirror,"" it made me imagian myself looking in the mirror and trying the steps. Reading through paragraph nine and seeing, (""Putting on a happy face"" actually work!) I completely agree with that statment because acting like you are hapy can actually help you be happy. I know that from personal experience. When I look at other people and see they are sad, I get sad or if I look at people that are excited i get excited.

This new technology can be very effective if it can actually tell the emotions of a person, not just the expression. This invention can help a lot of people understand one another. Understanding one another and ones emotions can lead to more peace in the world.",0
"What's the first thing you think about when you see a car? How much gas mileage its has? What year is it? How fast can it go? Well, have you ever thought about how much pollution it puts into our air that we breathe? Or the car bill you have to pay every month?I'm going to assume you don't. There are ways we can change this problem and im going to prove how!

To begin this argument im going to point out that over 77% of American people are in debt in their car bill, ALONE. That's over 34 of our population in the U.S. You cannot tell me people are not stressed from this over whelming statement! ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."", said by a former car owner Heidrun Walter. She now rides bicycles with her two children and now acar bill is one less thing she has to worry about in her hectic life.

Another advantage of limiting car usage would be do reduce smog pollution. Now this is not only a problem in America, it's all over theworld. Paris is particularly bad in this division. Paris typically has more smog that other European capitals. It got so horrible they has to enforce a ""driving ban"" to ensure all the air was clear in the global city. It even rivaled Beijing, China which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. After about five days the congestion on the streets plumitted down to 60%.

Having said that, not only is car usage bad for our earth, we could benefit our health from it! In Bogota, Columbia they set up a program named ""Car free day."" Millions of their citizens hiked, climbed, skated or took bus transportation to work. This day left the streets empty with no traffic, and the people that did drive had a 25 fine. Rain or shine nothing could stop these people from participating in this event. The city benefited from this so much that parks and sport centers have boomed from high demand because people want to have a healthier lifestyle in general. One day they hope every city has something similar to this day so that our owlrd will be heathier and even happier!

Therefor it is clearly obvious of the advantages we would have if we limited on car usage. People would be alot healthier not only from the excersise, but the air would be alot more cleaner to breathe in. Also it would be safer and cut down tremendously on deaths.We might just be over the peak of driving.",0
"A lot of people don't know that this techonolgy nowadays could determine the way you feel, it could determine the emotions that peope feel. It also shows the emotions or feelings of others. People probably think that this some type of joke or laugher kind of way when its not there really is techonology nowadays that could detect it. There's probably many ways people can detect to read the emotional expressions of students. Some ways that you probably didn't even know of.

A lot of people wonder how this works they don't really know that one easy way to show emotion or to show how you feel is by looking at them and looking at their actions. Once you have already seen them and that they are feeling some kind of way that's when you realize that there is something going on or that their sad or happy or that they are just going through stuff. People know that by the facial expressions on their face. They say that us as humans perform the same impressive ""calculation"". Some people struggle or have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried,sad,etc. This would be one easy way students can detect emotions.

Parents probably disagree about using technology when showing their emotions. Not just parents but maybe some students wouldn't like it either but if they think about it instead of waisting your time just guessing what their emotions are you would know if they use the proper techonology. They had made a process that began when the computer constructed a 3-D computer model of the face and it showed that all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles.

Another interesting thing that they discovered was that Dr. Paul Eckman was the creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). He had classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. It also associated each with characterestic movements of the facial muscles. They invented somethIng else called video imagery, the new emotion software is that they track facial movement. As you can see its so easy to see their emotions or how they feel. They even show different weighting of units.

The author says that the Mona Lisa demonstrates is really to bring a smile to peoples face while it shows how much the computer can do. It would be really strange if a computer can tell you if your happy or sad.

In my opinion parents and students should get the idea of using techonology its way easier to detect peoples emotions instead of just guessing or thinking you know how they feel. They shouldn't have a problem trying to make the place better.",0
"The Facial Action Coding System is a great program with many applacations. We have facial expressions even when were not feeling any thing but we dont realize it. Takeing the The ""FACS"" would be great in schools. Not it also can pick out the ones who cant consentrate, when they are overwhelmed .It would allow teachers to get real time feedback on what they just introduced to the students.

The more majority of kid dont like to admit that the dont under stand somthing when all their classmates do. So ""FACS"" could help find kids that are confused before they fall behind,"" A classroom computer could recognize when a students is becoming confused or bored"" - 6 Nick D' Alto. This could help improve students test scores becuase the teacher would know who needs a bit more time for and explanation and who under stands it. This could help students from digging themselves a hole , but it's not a total safey net they still have to do the work.

Facial action coding system have one of the best uses in the classroom. They can see somthing that teachers cant or dont notice. With this tech we could also spot learning disaplitys earlier too, so they dont get maked as a ""dumb"" kid and get swept under the rug. We sould implment ""FACS"" in classrooms becuase it can help kids who are confused and it can help keep them from falling too far behind",0
"The author tells us how hard and difficult it is to land or even study venus because its so hard to land on or get close to because of all the dangerous things that can happen.

venus is a very worthy planet to study because nobody has ever been on it to know if there is any kind of life ont hat planet , or if plants can grow or anything. because its the closest planet to earth but the hardest to land on.

because venus really used to be covered with oceans and etc just like earth and nobody can really tell what it looks like now theres just alot of curocity. a bunch of people wondering what it looks like.

but venus is covered with a thick atmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankets. But its even more challenging with the clouds and highly corrosive sulfuric acid.

But on the surface of venus temperatures average around 800 degrees fahrenheit , and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.

venus is a hard planet to study but it is very worth it. Becayse there are alot of things you can descover about venus and alot of people that would love to know whats really on venus.",0
"The Face on Mars is just a natural landform. It, when originally pictured, may have looked like some sort of face or alien artifact, but with new high-resolution imaging and 3D altimetry, we can see that this ""Face"" is just a mesa. This type of mesa is commonly found in the region of Mars where the Face is located, called Cydonia. These mesas are also commonly found here on Earth, in the American Southwest. The fact that these types of landforms are commonplace means that the Face is nothing special.

One piece of evidence that supports my claim is the new photos. Back in 1976, when the Face was first pictured, the pixel size on photos of Mars was 43 meters per pixel! That makes for a very blurry picture with not many details. When the Face was photographed in 1998, and again in 2001, the pixel size was much smaller, at 1.56 meters per pixel. This means that objects on the Martian surface bigger than 5 meters would be picked up in detail by the photo. This proves that the new picture shows it all: a common, everyday mesa.

A second piece of evidence that supports my claim is that NASA would not try to hide alien artifacts in their pictures from the public. This is because if NASA found life on Mars through one of their studies, they would become very popular for the fact and would draw a lot of attention. They may have even won a Nobel Prize, so NASA would definitely not hide it. Conspiracy theorists who claim the Face is alien would be completely wrong because of this fact. NASA isn't hiding anything. The Face on Mars is just a mesa.

A third piece of evidence that supports my claim is that NASA was excited about displaying this photo and wanted to learn more just like the public. They wouldn't have given all this trouble to the Face just to lie about it to the general citizens. NASA was probably disappointed when they found out that the Face was a mesa, but they had to tell the truth. Mesas are common around Cydonia, and also common on Earth, so there is no reason for NASA to lie.

In conclusion, the Face on Mars is a completely false object. This ""Face"" is just a common mesa, found all the time where the Face is and on Earth. NASA did not lie about the Face because they had no reason to. The new, high-resolution imaging says it all. The Face on Mars is a mesa. No doubt about it. Case closed.",0
"Generic_Name was at the store and was looking at the nice clothes. He was really desperate for a nice blue shirt, however, he couldn't because he needed the money for his rent. Generic_Name picks up his phone and decides to text one of his friends. He knows that his friend, Generic_Name, would help him. He texted, ""Hey, I was wondering if I should buy something about 40 dollars. I need to pay rent but I might need to budget my money. What should I do?"" Generic_Name replies that he should buy it and budget his money. Generic_Name decides to purchase the shirt, but he feels like he shouldn't. He decides to ask his mom. His mom said that he should pay the rent instead of a shirt because if he would get an unexpected increase on his bill, he wouldn't be able to pay it. Generic_Name doesn't know which side to take on.

People make choices every day. Choices can be as big as choosing who to marry, or having kids to as small as whether you should buy dessert from the ice cream truck. Most of the time, people ask others for advice and they ask more than one person. But sometimes, opinions can cause bias if you only ask one person. When Generic_Name asks if he should buy the shirt. He asked his friend who said to budget his money afterwards. What Generic_Name did was ask one person and Generic_Name's opinion was bias against what his bills may be. When Generic_Name asked his mother, she said that he shouldn't and be prepared for the bill in case there was an increase. Generic_Name' mom was bias against the shirt.

When you choose to ask someone for help, somebody could give you more than one option. Maybe the question you thought was a yes or no answer, could be both answers. Imagine that Generic_Name decides that he also wanted pants to go with the shirt. He could've asked someone again but this time, someone could say to buy both and pay the rent. Or, someone could say to not buy any clothes and stick with the bills to pay. Hearing more options and opinions could help you make an option that you think would be best for you.

What would happen if you ask the whole store? You would probably get a whole lot of different opinions, but you are the final decider on what you want to do. Sometimes, you could ask someone who has a lot of experience with dealing with money and you could get better advice than what your mom or friend suggested. If you ask only one person and he says something that you do not feel would be the best option, don't go with it. There could be better options for you to take.

Generic_Name asked another person who dealt with money as their job and they gave the advice that you should not buy it until you need to do so and buy the shirt and pants when you know you have enough money. Generic_Name went with that decision and it ended up benefiting him. His bills went up because while he was at the store. he left the faucet running and it costed him extra. Generic_Name paid his bills and when he showed up at work the next day, he was given a raise at work and he went to the store soon after and bought the shirt and the pants. He felt so happy that he decided to ask more than just one person rather than Generic_Name, who would've caused him to declare bankruptcy.

Not only did Generic_Name ask multiple opinions, but he got more options. where his mother told him one thing, Generic_Name told him another, and person who worked with budgeting money, Generic_Name, told him another thing. That gave him plenty of options to choose from. Generic_Name also got better advice while asking more people. He could've gone bankrupt if he went with Generic_Name's idea. Since he asked other people, he decided on choosing what Generic_Name said.",0
"Imagine having a Facial Coding System computers that identify's yours or your classmates emotions. How would you feel about having this system in your classroom? Would it be weird? Would it be fun and intersting?

In my opinion it sounds like a pretty cool idea, but to have it in a classroom and know your classmates emotions sounds pretty wierd. Becaue I wouldn't like for my classmates to know what im feeling or my emotions at that time, that sounds pretty personal to me and I think thats giving to much information to your classmates. I mean I'm not saying its a bad thing for your classmates to know your emotions, but I honestly wouldnt like it.

Not only do I think its some what personal but it do sound pretty intersting at the same time. Like I think its cool that the teacher would know when you start feeling that the class is boring and the teacher can do somethung different and make it fun or change the way that he's teaching and do something else. Like that sounds pretty awesome, but other hen that I wouldn't like havving this type of system in my classroom.

Honestly having this system in my classroom its like a 50/50 percent because it sounds cool and everything, but at the sametime I don't like it because I wouldn't want my classmates knowing what I'm at that in the class because I don't people knowing my business only the people I truly trust. Thats another thing you might not talk to all the people in your classrooms and might not know them or trust them like that. For example, one day you could be sad and all your classmates are going to know and they might be asking you whats wrond and what if you don't want to talk about it.

All in all, I'm in a 50/50 chance it sounds fun and all that, but at the same time I dont want them knowing my business.",0
"I think studing venus is a good idea becuase there a proboly a lot of new thing to descover on venus. Venus is the cloest planet to earth in the terms of density and size. Even tho each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more then a few hours, and it will still be a good risk for a new life. Not a single spaceship has touchdown on venus in more then three decades. I think studying venus is a good idea because the spaceship that was up there never made it back and one day sombody will. There is a thick atmosphere of almost 97 precent carbon dioxide blankets venus. the clouds are even more challenging (of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atmosphere). Venus has the hottest surface temerature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Venus is almost's earth twin but it is just hard to get there and take a long time. There are alot of things that people haven't found yet but are geting closer to finding, it's up to them to bring it back. they are still tring new ways to study venus. for example, (some simplified simulating the chaos of venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such condition). They are trying many different ways to study venus, they are looking back toan old technology called mechanical computers. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during the world war 2. I think that they should still study venus becaus it is a lot of thing that haven't found yet.",0
"Former Primer Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"", and in my opinion I agree with Churchill's words. Failure has a enormous role in success. Failure is all about, learning from the mistakes you made and gaine all the experience you can out of it, Not giving up and plan what can you do better to accomplish what you have been fighting for to get even better results that the ones you were expecting in the first place, that is what failure is all about and that is why it has big and important a role in the pursuit of success.

Learning from the mistakes that were done is a big example of the role that failure has on the pursuit of success; throughout history there had been many times were our society, nation, and specie had learned from their mistakes; as an example of this is the League of Nations, it was created after WWI to maintain worldwide peace; It end up being a big failure. we learned from this and the U.N was created to maintain global peace through nations and till present days it stills been one of societies biggest success. this is an example of how learning from mistakes you have made in the past is useful but overall this is one of many examples you can put to show how failure is related to success.

Not giving up is also really important on this because giving up is not an answer as an example of this is, Pele, he became one of the best soccer players in history but it also became the youngest player to win a world cup, since a really small age he was told that he was never going to become a soccer player, he was told numerous time that his talent was not enough, but he did not gave up, he gave all he had and when he had the chance he showed everyone of what he was capable of and became one of the best players in the world. In his debut on first world cup he suffered an injury on his knee while training for the first match, it let him out for half of the of world cup. Doctors told him that he had to do exercise every day to get better, but that he was not going to be able to play in the whole tournament; he did not give up he trained day after day and in the third phase of the world cup he was given an opportunity to play in one of the games. This is a great example of the strength that people have when they do not give up and they give all they are capable of. This is also a great example that shows how failure has many things directly related at helping people to success at what they are trying to achieve.

Another example of how failure can help you success is trying once more. this is the most important feature in the relationship of failure and success because once you have looked back at what you did wrong last time and learning from that, you are ready to try once more and accomplish what you have been fighting for. As an example of this is the spaceships that have send to space to reach many places in the universe. Its well known that many of the spaceships that have been send to space failed, and in really big proportions. Many of those spaceships exploded do to problems on their systems or other problems. After many tries looking at what failed and what went wrong humans were able to send satellites and people to the outer space, it took many failures to till we got all of this finished, now we are able to send spaceships throughout the galaxy to explore the stars and many other places. failure taught us what were we doing wrong, and we learned from it, this shows us of how failure is related to success by trying many times to achieve what you are fighting to achieve.

Many people believe that failure is not related in any way to success, they have arguments saying that, you can accomplish something at the first try, that you do not learn anything from the mistake or the times you have failed at something, and they also say that you lose all enthusiasm when you fail numerous times at something. I believe this people are wrong because you do not always accomplish something in the first try, and you always learn from your mistakes, you might learn valuable lessons out of them; their last argument can be denied by telling to yourself that you can do it, we decide when do we lose our enthusiasm or not. this is why I believe they are wrong failure is related in the pursuit of success even if we want it or not because you learn and gain experience out of it, that is what makes this world a better place, failure, and it might sound like is not true but I believe it is; failure is always there and we can always learn valuable lessons out of it.

Like I stated in my examples above failure is related to success; failure is not a bad thing because we learn from the mistakes we have done, we can gain experience out of it, we learn what are we doing wrong, but what we have to keep in mind is that we decide if we lose the enthusiasm in something whenever we decide to do it, this is why I believe that the words that Winston Churchill said are true, because from failure to failure we learn from the mistakes we made along the way to success, we can think of a better plan with the things we learned and after that we can try once more to accomplish the thing we have failed with better results that those we were expecting. That is why I think that failure is related to success. ",0
"The car is a staple in modern day society by many standards, it represents wealth, sociatal rank however; on the more negative side of the matter cars are the result of a majority of deaths in the United States. Alongside the fatalities, cars also pollute the environment that is so very delicate. The benifits of becoming car-free are immense and far outweigh the ""negatives"" that come alongside living without cars.

Cars as many people know see them are recognized for their glamour and attraction, but what is forgotten somewhere in the infatuation with cars is the true devastation they can cause. Cars in the United States and many other countries around the world account for a majority of the fatalities in total. Living without cars would completely irradicate the fatalities due to cars as well as reducing the stress that comes along with having such a hefty responsibility.

Along with the potential danger to humans, in the United States cars are the second largest source of emmisions right behind power plants according to paragraph 34. Countries like India and China are among the top few most polluted cities on this planet; now imagine the imact of implimenting a car-free law. The amount of pollution would go down immensely and the effect that this would have on the lifespan of people living in those countries would be incredulous. Some will argue that this will negatively have a change on their life. And to that I would say, are you willing to sacrifice some of the comfort that a car supplies you for a better life for your children and grandchildren?

Many people aknowledge that buying a car is arguably the second largest and expensive purchases that will be made in your life second to a house. The amount of money that would be saved from living a car-free life would be incredible. Without having to pay car payments, car insurance, and gas fees every month imagine what this money could be going towards. Removing such a monitary factor would reap such high rewards that so many would agree is completely worth some of the sacrifices that would have to be made.

All in all cars are not completely necessary, and that implimenting such a thing would have such a benificial outcome for society as a whole. Think not about the present but about the future of the world, and by living a car-free life you are bettering the present community as well as the future world.",0
"Most people like to ask advice when they do not know something or they are confused. A good reason to ask more than one person for advice is that the other person could be bias towards the subject you`re talking about. Some peoples opinions are not great but can definitely help sometimes others peoples way of thinking can change yours. There was one time I asked for advice about school and how can I make it easier one person said just wait until high school where you can drop out that is really bad advice for example. I waited for someone else to ask and I asked my dad he said to just pay attention and try your best which helped me out with a lot because I dont do both and need to be reminded that is a good example of good advice. The reasons why people should ask more than one person for advice the person is educated to the topic, they are a good person that has made bad decisions, and someone that thinks like me.

A good reason to ask someone educated on the topic is that if I was asking I would want someone smart in what im asking about for a good opinion. For good opinions you ask the smartest person. The reason why is that they can help more. If someone can help more it is better for everyone. I will most likely ask the most educated person in the topic im looking into.

If a person makes bad choices they learn form them thats why I think asking people like that for advice is a great idea. Everyone makes a bad choice once or twice but its good to learn form other peoples bad choices to. The people that make bad choices are usually open minded and can tell about learning from there mistakes.

Someone that thinks like me can help me with a lot of things but I would be more biased to them because they think like me. The bad thing is that I could be more likely to listen to the person that thinks like me because I like them more than the other people. It helps to hear something out loud from someone else than in my head. The biggest reason I would like this is because it is hard to find someone that thinks like me and it would be nice also.

The essay talks about asking for advice and opinions. I named three type of people to ask for advice. I said someone smart and educated about the topic, they are a good person and made bad mistakes, and someone that thinks like me. I gave reason about all three in the paragraphs. My favorite paragraph to write was three because it was interesting to write about the topic.",0
"No Cellphones While Driving

I think cell phones should be banned while driving. The use of cellphones while driving can cause many accidents. Most states already have a law that prohibits the use of cellphones while driving. Car accidents are the leading cause of deaths for teenagers. Another reason they should be banned is because of the rise in ones insurance.

Many beginning drivers are the ones who are most likely to text and drive. They feel like they are free and feel they look cool with their phones out while behind the wheel. Not only teenagers, but anyone can be talking on the phone and get distracted and cause an accident. The use of cellphones is the leading cause of many accidents.

Due to the high rate of accidents, insurance is very expensive. Insurance is extremely high for teenagers because they are the ones who tend to cause more accidents. Personally, I have almost hit many cars because I was distracted by a text message or a phone call. Since the economy and world is very different now, money is very tight. Let's face it, nobody wants to pay a high amount or even pay with their life just to check one message.

Not only do you have to watch for cars, but for pedestrians as well. If you are in a crowded area, or somewhere near many sidewalks, avoid your phone. Anyone can be crossing the road at anytime and since the person is not paying attention to the road, there can be a very deadly accident. Hitting a pedestrian is probably the worst thing you could do. There are now new apps on cell phones that will let others know you are on the road.

Therefore, do not text and drive. Being distracted on your phone can cause many accidents. You can hit a car, make others crash, or even worse, hit a pedestrian while they're crossing the road. Cell phones should be banned when driving.",0
"One small step for man, one giant leap for man-kind. Those were the words spoken by Neil Armstrong seconds before he took a giant leap on the moon.

This is a memorable event in American history because it was the first American to ever set foot on the moon.

Before Neil made it to the moon, no one thought that it would ever be possible to make it that far.

Now we are planning to explore Venus. The author states that he wants to explore Venus no matter what the percautions are. There are always good and bad effects of each action and the exploration of Venus has a lot of them.

First of all, the author states that Venus is the closest planet to the earth when Mars is not; it depends on their orbits around the sun. With Venus a close distance to the earth, it would be easier to explore than any other planet in the galaxy.

This planet has the most Earth-like features in the Milky Way which makes it attract scientists. There are so many valuable reasons why the exploration of this planet is a good idea.

On the contrary, the most difficult part of the mission is Venus' atmosphere.

Carbon dioxide takes up 97 percent of the atmoshere; also the clouds have highly corrosive sulfuric acid clouds.

If that does not damage a spacecraft, the pressure that is 90 times greater than Earth will. The temperatures there way over exceed the temperatures on Earth; the temperature there averages over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. NASA has been working on spacecraft to make it there and they are making progress.

Humans have already sent numerous spacecraft to land on Venus already; however, none of the spacecraft made it on the planet long enough for any human to survive there.

The author constructed his information very well.

The author explained why NASA wants to explore Venus.

Facts were provided to let the reader know that this article is not just opionated but also factual.

I really liked how the author explained why Venus will be a hard mission to achieve, it shows that NASA knows their weaknesses and therefore will be able to fix them.

NASA has many backup plans in case one of them fail.

In conclusion, this was a well written article.

The author knew what he was talking about which persuaded me to think that studying Venus would benefit science.

I also applied my background knowledge of the moon landing while reading this article; I knew that it once seemed impossible to land on the moon but we achieved it, now we are planning to land on Venus and hopefully will achieve that too.",0
"Dear Senator, The topic of the Electoral college is a hot one, and the idea of whether of not to adjust it is controversial. Many citizen disagree with the process while many are in favor. What should we do? We should change the Electoral College. The voting is based more on quantity instead of quality, and the voting is not coming from the citizen's directly, making the risk of an unfaithful candidate too high and the actual voting less popular and more electoral. When one stateor even one person could change the whole ball game that is the Presidential Election, then what does that mean for our democracy?

While many will argue that it is a fair way to vote, the Electoral College has many flaws. First off, the candidates are focusing on more power and higher tallying states to get them through the election than everyone as a whole. For example, if you were a presidential candidate would you spend more time trying to sway California, with its whopping 55 electoral votes, or montana, with a teeny tiny 3 electoral votes? The candidates are not being considerate of ALL the American citizens, but instead the ones that they think will lead them to victory. This is not what the election is all about. The election is more focused on the popular vote of few states with many inhabitants than it is on many states with few citizens.

""Under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" As stated in ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses are wrong"" . Being that this true, why do we call it the ""Presidential Election"" instead of the ""Electors Election?"" Electors claim to be faithful to their candidates but sometimes this is not the case. If a member of the group is unfaithful to their candidate, it could unsettle the whole election, meaning that the United States as a whole would have to pay for the electors actions. This is not how voting was meant to be. Our slogan is ""We the People,"" not ""We the Electors."" Now, I know what you're thinking, ""Why would we change this system? It is already established and has worked for many years."" In order to move forward as a nation we as a whole need to make changes sometimes. Just think what it would be like today if segregationan established rule and law was not questioned. Or even if the settlers of the United States had not questioned our former mother country and broke away. We would not even be the establishment we are today if we did not question established rules or traditions. The Electoral College is nothing more than a system that needs to be reevaluated, putting the popularity if the candidate in clearer perspective.

To recap, The Electoral College does not include the popularity of the candidates over official influences. The states are not being counted equally and electors control the electon overall. In order to have a more successful government and a more included population, the Electoral College simply needs to be reevaluated and changed to meet the popularity standards of our country if we are to ever advance.",0
"Does failure play a big role in success? Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that, ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" Although failure often just ends up in failure, I agree with Winston Churchill's statement that failure can lead to success if people continue to use enthusiasm.

First of all, many of our inventions used today are a result of failures.

For example, Edison created the lightbulb, but failed many times before he discovered electricity.

He used his faith and motivation to not give up and keep trying even though he had many set backs.

He accidently made a circular shaped like glass ball which became a source of electricity. If Edison did not keep trying, we would not have electricity today. Also, many scientists have created medicines after many failed attempts.

For instance, there is now a chicken pox shot that prevents people from getting the chicken pox.

Through many experiements with mixure of chemicals and failed trials, scientists were eventually able to find a shot that prevents chicken pox from entering your system. These examples show that failures often lead to success if people never give up trying.

Second of all, many students have failed in school, but if they keep trying and keep their enthusiam, they will succeed. For example, I have had a hard time in school, especially with passing my sol's. When time goes on, I try harder and harder, and spend more time studying with my teacher.

As of today, I have passed all of the sol's I need in order to graduate except for the one I am writing about right now.

I also have a learning disability and ADHD and have a hard time paying attention and often lose focus in my classes.

Even with my disability, I have not given up and keep coming to school and get extra help from my teachers so that I can graduate this year.

I make sure I follow the rules, don't skip class, or don't miss school becuase it's so hard for me to make up what I miss. Although many seniors like to skip class, I do not skip becuase I want to earn a high school diploma. Even in education, there are failures, but through hard work and a good attitude, students can succeed.

In conclusion, I agree with Chruchill's statement ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of entusiasm.""

Even though people will experience failures, there will be success if they work hard, keep the enthusiiasm, and never give up. ",0
"The electoral college should be abolished because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidates elector source 1, and the voters cant always control who their electors vote for source 2. On the other hand the electoral college is a great thing because a dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote source 3.

When you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidates elector source 1. Most people, including me, would like to vote for the president not a candidate because they might not even vote for the person you want for president. Some states are smaller then others so that makes them feel like their votes arent as important as the bigger states like California and Texas. The electoral college consists of only 538 electors compared to how many people are actually in the U.S. so there is a greater chance that the wrong president might be elected.

Many people do not vote because the voters cant always control who their electors vote for source 2. Not everyone wants to take the chance of voting for the wrong person to be elected for president. Some voters might get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate, as it says in source 2. Most states are small so most people in those states dont think the little states matter and they arent important in the election when they actually do.

On the other hand the electoral college is a great thing because a dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote source 3. A better thing about the electoral college is that it requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal, meaning that not all the vote can come from one or two regions and no other ones. Voters in presidential elections are the people who want to express a political preference rather than the people woh tihnk a single vote can dicide an election.

As a student I want the best for the up coming generations, including me, that are going to be able to be a part of the presidential elections and to not be confused who to vote for or how the electoral college works. Every year a new generation becomes legal to vote and be part of the election but if they dont know how to vote or how it works then they wont be able to. Some people dont know anything about poitics but, still want to be able to vote so, it should be easy for them to vote for who they want to be president rather then the long process of, voting for the canidates elector and most of the time they dont vote for who they want and they vote for the wrong person.",0
"Should we keep the electoral college? No because when you vote for your canidate in the presidential election you are actually voting for his/her electors. Also because electors can be anyone not holdin up in the public office. Finally because voters cant always control their elected electoral college member will vote for the same canidate. Over 60 percent of todays voters would prefer a more direct way of electing our officials than how we are electing them now.

Did you know that when you vote for the canidate that you want to be elected into office you are not only voting for that canidate you are actually voting for that canidates electors? Under the electoral college system us voters dont vote for the president but we vote for a slate of electors which in turn elect the canidate we voted for. Say that you voted for Obama in last years election you didnt actually vote for Obama you voted for his electors to vote for im in turn of you voting for them. Many people see this to be fine but say that your canidates electors turned and voted for someone else thus leading you down a road of betrayl. This is one important reason for the electoral party to be disbanded.

Electors that represent a canidate in the presidential run can be anyone not holding public office. Who chooses for these electors? Not the voters of course but the state and sometimes the people who you are actually voting for the electors you havent even heard of or seen in any flyers or ads. That state chooses their officials from state conventions,and even sometimes at the state partys committee or the president has his own party of electors for himself which would in a way be cheating by having your own officials vote for you.

What if the electoral party you voted for to vote for a specific canidate and they went off and changed their mind mid election and passed that countries vote for a different xcanidate in the election? You cant always control the eletors to stick with them voting for the elector you voted for but without the electoral college that group of voters who voted for a canidate would actually vote for the canidate that they actually want to win. Thus making the electoral college irrelevent because they dont need to form a party and change their vorte mid election.

We should not not keep the electoral college because of all the flawls in it and the deciving image it holds up. Because you do not vote for the canidate you vote for the electorial party member representing that canidate. That the canidate can be anyone chosen by the state and you cant always control that the member of the electoral college that you voted for to vot for a different canidate that the ended up voting for during the election. This is why we dont need the electoral college to help vote for the presidents we should have a more direct way of voting.",0
"Facial expressions can tell a lot about you, but do you really know what your facial expression is actually showing? Well being all about the new technology will tell you a lot about your self. Being about the technology will tell you about facial expressions, how the muscles in your face can tell how you really feel, and how the technology works for people. This technology will tell how a person really feels.

Facial expressions can tell a lot about a person and how they might feel. When someone is frowning others may think that your mad or sad. But when someone is smiling others may think that they are happy or excitied. Facial expressions can tell a lot about people but noone really knows what the true facial expresson is. When a person is happy they might simle, when a person is scared they might make a frightened facial expression. Each facial expression means something different.""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"", ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression."".

Muscles on your face tell what expression a person is using. Someone who is smiling muscles are shaped different from when they are sad or mad. Depending on how you feel is the way your muscles are shaped. ""your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above our eyes) raises your eyebrows when your surprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger."", said Dr. Paul Eckman.

You may be wondering how this technology works and what it really does. Well ""this process begins when the vcomputer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."". ""Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit.."". "" There are six basic emotions- happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fera, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristics movements of the facial muscles."" By weighting different units, the software can even indentify mixed emotions, meaning that the weight of it can tell. Each one of the expressions that are used are compared to neutral faces.

Imagine if a computer can tell weather your confused or mad or even sad. What if when it could tell what facial expression you was meaning it woud change to your intrest. This technology could help a lot of people. For an example it could help school kids become more intrested in school work if it could tell you was bored and made it more intresting. By showing the students facial expression this technoloy can better the student just by changing it into something that makes it better for them.",0
"Drivers should not be able to use their phones while driving. In Georgia a hands free law was passed to prevent drivers from doing other things while driving. When drives are distracted they can put their life in danger as well as other people in the car or other people on the road. Drivers should take that into consideration when they are on the roads driving. Drivers should be 100% focused on the road and not concerned about other things such as phones.

Most people can not focus while driving so it is very serious that drivers keep their eyes on the road. Texting and driving is like driving with your eyes clothes one little text can put your life in so much danger. Cars are made with bluetooth so that it lowers the chance of distracted drivers. Drivers should pay attention when they are driving such as drinking and driving. Kids are in the car with drivers when they don't know anything that goes on with drivers.

When you get caught on your by a police officer you can be fined and lose your license. When you lose your license you would have to go through a long process of getting them back. You can also get points taken off your license risking the chance of you doing things as far as traveling and police will be strict on you. You can save many lives just by paying attention to the road because others sometimes don't pay attention.

This texting and driving can be very serious and dangerous. Your family would be sad if something bad happened to you causing you to not make it home all because of a text. With bluetooth cars you can talk to the car a drive its called hands free. You can text people back on the steering wheels its options for that so that it lowers the risk of you taking your eyes off the road. Making it home feels like a big accomplishment to some people.

High Schoolers and younger kids should be required to take a class that teaches them more about the severity of texting and driving. Teens get cars and can't stay off their phones. They are more likely to be the ones to get in an accident. Teens could download a app while driving to preventing them from being on their phones while driving this app helps teens earn discounts on popular things that they want to purchase. Texting while driving should never be allowed!",0
"The FACS( Facial

Action Coding System) is a computer software that can scan the muslces of someones face and tell the emotions that person is feeling. The FACS seems like a very useless peice of software.

In the article, you read about how they used this software to ""decode"" the face of the Mona Lisa. The software was said to have worked and was able to tell the emotions she was feeling that very day. She was eighty-three percent happy, nine percent disgusted, six percent fearful, and 2 percent angry.

Using this type of software on students in class will be useless and also a waste of time. Decoding the face of a student in class wont change anything in the class room. Paragraph six, line six, the author is telling how we can use the software to tell when a student is becoming confused or bored in class and is able to modify the lesson for the that student. Using this software would only be effeciant to those who learn on computers. A teacher could not use this software on a big class full of students because she would get differnt emotions from many different students. The teacher would not be able to give a lesson for just a couple of students in class based on the FACS

The FACS( Facial Action Coding System) would be useless for students. Online schooling could use this software but students in a class room would make the software useless",0
"Dear State Senator,

In my experience, I strongly believe that you should get rid of the electoral college to a popular vote. If you do that, the votes would become fair to voters, and more voters would actually pay attention to the campaine. On the other hand, i do see why you would want to keep the Electoral college, but let me explain to you two of the many reasons why you should get rid of it.

First, people do argue that the electoral college does pay attention to some of the regiment in voters. In Plumer's article he says,"" - thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election"" To me, the voters who do like the electoral college pretty much just want to see that they can trust them just for the popular votes to succeed. But honestly, I think they still shouldn't be the ones to choose. Even if they may help the popular votes a little, they aren't fair in a lot of ways. Way more voters are against them than with.

So let me explain one of my reasons, I believe you should get rid of the electoral college is because it isn't fair to voters. A lot of the time voters don't trust that the electoral college pays attenetion to the votes sent out. Acorrding to Plumer's article, 'The Indefensible Electoral College:' he states, "" In the same vein, ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" When voters hear that, chaos starts. They want to have say for who the next President will be not just the electoral college's say. There have been some real incidents where the electoral college has voted based on what they believe and not other voters. For example, in Hawaii in 1960, The vice president, Richard Nixon, validated his opponents votes. Voters worry and get angry when there trust is broken. They want to be the ones to vote because of course they trust themselves. If you do get rid of the electoral college, voters would be more satisified and feel that their vote would be fair.

Lastly, the second reason why I believe that  getting rid of the electoral college is that voters would pay more attention and actually put thought in who they vote. If they think that their vote won't matter they won't care who wins. They would most likely jot down a random candidate and send it in. In the article, ' In Defnse of the Electoral College:', Posner states, "" Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were to be picked by a popular vote..."" With that said, there is support that states people would have beter interest in voting if they had  popular vote and no more electoral college. I believe people would actually spend more of their time on debating who should deserve to be President.

To conclude my reasons, please take them in consideration. Voters would be treated much fairly and pay more attention to voting than they do now. I believe you should get rid of the electoral college so there will be less arguing.

"Have you ever been in a situation where you feel as if you have no guidance and don't know what to do? Including myself and probably you too, 55% of people say they've been in a situation where they felt helpless and alone with no guidance. As you're reading this, I'm probably still in the situation related to this prompt, but I've taken my time to consult in other people. The reasons you should do such are because everyone has a different viewpoint and it can become easier to resolve the situation.

The number one reason, in my opinion, that you should consult in other people for advice is because everyone that you ask has a different perspective. This is a pretty straight forward fact, when you ask someone for advice, you ask because sometimes you can't rely on your own opinion, and need to see what other people think about a certain situation you're in. For example, right now I'm in a hard place because I've done something to my friend that upset her. I had decided to tell someone something I told her I wouldn't tell anyone, so I broke her trust. Because I couldn't think for myself and myself only, I asked my friends what they thought. Some of my closest friends thought that I was in the right, while other people that I wasn't as close but still friends with thought that I was in the wrong, or that we were both in the wrong. That's why you ask for other people's opinions, it opens your mind to possibilities or outcomes you probably never thought of.

Another reason you should ask for advice is because with other people's help, it can become easier to resolve the situation. In my opinion, this is because the more people you tell about it, the quicker it's going to get back to the other person involved. So because of this, people may start talking to the other person and help you resolve the problem. It also helps way better because in some problems (like mine), you just end up ignoring the other person until one of you gives up and says sorry. That's not what problem solving is, because you never end up actually talking about what happened, do you? You just end up saying sorry and moving on with your lives as if it never happened. To me, I believe in talking before saying sorry, which is why if other people get involved, it becomes easier to open up to each other about what went wrong.

Sometimes, people that care too much about you to let you know that you may have been in the wrong give you the advice that you want to hear instead of their take on it. However, not everyone will do this, and if you ask the people you know will give you the realest answer, you'll find a solution. In the end, not everyone is going to tell you what you wanna hear. That's the reason you should ask for advice, because you don't have to rely on your own opinion.

Whenever you're in a situation where you don't know what to do, the best thing to do is to ask others on what they think. This is because it helps you resolve the situation easier and because everyone has their own opinion. Therefore, I encourage you to consult in other people for help!",0
"I believe this would benefit students around the world, students would be able to attend classes from any school no matter where students live, this would help students who live far way from school and can't get a ride to school. Attending classes online from home would make it more comfortable for students.

Distance learning is good thing for students that want to study in school around the world or get the best education, students can be at home taking some classes that their country does not offer. Let's say a student lives in France and the student takes classes from United States, that's a good benefit, because you are learning education from another country in a different way that your country teaches you. This will be good for students who live in different country temporarily and are coming back to their countries.

The schools that offer distance learning are making life easier for some students who can't get education of they have to walk for hours to go to school. I remember watching a video about girl's life where she explains how far she has to walk though the mountains for 4 hours just to get to school. There are students who can't get education, because of the places they live, like places that are cold or far way from the city. This a good benefit in the United States since there's is a virus called corona virus in some states people are already effect with it, schools are closing cause of that students will be talking classes at home.

In school some students feel uncomfortable of working with their teachers or classmates, that makes students to stop working or lose interest on their work, but when they are home school students feel more comfortable, because they are at their house with their family, they feel more safe at their house and they can trust their family. In schools one of the main reasons why students feel uncomfortable of going to class is because some students get bully by their classmates, others get peer pressure to try to do things they don't like or be something they are not, making students not to be themselves. There was this famous video of a kid who was crying and told his mom that he wanted a knife to kill himself, he was just 7 years old, the reason why he wanted to kill himself is because many people at his school make fun him for being small, the students at his school were bullying him so much that he had to be home school and get therapist to help him get better and be comfortable.

At the end being able to attend classes at home depends if the students like it not everyone would think this is a good benefit for students others would think that is bad for students to take classes at home, because students will not get the chance to be social with other, this will make students not be able to work or talk with others outside in person, because they spent so much time at their houses taking classes by themselves. I have friend who used to be home school, now he goes to a high school and because he was home school, he doesn't talk that much in school, he doesn't have that many friends, it takes a while to get to know him. Taking classes from home is only good benefit if you want to take classes from another school, can't go to school because of where you live or it takes too long to walk to school, and if you don't feel comfortable in school, those are the main reasons students would taking classes from home.

"Do you ever wonder how amazing it is to study another planet. Do think of all the risks it takes? Well the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by having a thick Atmosphere, shipping orbiting, and testing electronics made of silicon.

The first reason why it is challenging is that a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide runs through Venus. In the passenge it states,"" on the planet's suface temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmosphere pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. ""This piece is important because it gives you an example of how the temperature is really high. Plus, the perfect temperature for a human is 98.

The second reason why it is competitive is that venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on the ground conditions. In the article it says,"" more importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rocks, gas, or anything else, from a distance."" this explains how they can't be able to experiment things without there tools. This is challenging for them because they won't be able to do much. An example is that they won't be able to photograph and videograph ineffectively.

The third reason why they it is difficult is that some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in venus's suface. In the text it states, ""modern computers are enormously powerful, flexable, and quick but tend to be more delicated when it comes to extreme physical conditions."" This shows how technology from now can't be used in venus. In order for them to use technology is that they have to use those old computers from back in the 1940's.

In conclusion, This is how the author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by having a thick atmosphere, shipping orbiting, and testing electronics made of silicon. Being able to explore other planets are challenging. would you risk yourself just to go to explore another planet?",0
"First,for example some people prefer working in grougp because they would get extra help. The other person in the group become with a new idea. I think working in group it is fun becuase each person in the group would l help. That why I prefer working in group than alone because the desventage of working alone is I can not get help from anyone. Also I can not finish it early it would take long.

Second, for example If I work in group we would descuss first and then be an a agreement. Then start working each person in group would have to answer and with different answer. If any one in the group does not know the answer the group would help him or her. It is easy and fast to finish any class work if it is in group. Working in group it is fun because each person learn from another idea of the other person.

Third, working by yourself it is kinda hard. Some people prefer working by themself because they think it better. Working alone is more stressful. That why people should work in group. It help and it is more better and less use of their mind.

Fourth, for example if I do a classwork by myself and it is hard. It would take me more time to do the researchs in google. Also I would finish it late. That why I prefer working in group than alone.

fifth, finally I would like to recomend to each students to work in group unless they are smart enough to do it by themself. However some students or people like to wotk alone if they smart then probably they would finish it on time. Teacher should be agree with me. When students work in group it is less stressful because they can hel each other. Therefore students or people should work toguether because it is less stressful and it would benefits a lot.",0
"Technology can be good uses for a lot of things in life espiecally for emotional,mental,and physical reasons. Technology has came a long way for many years and it becomes better every single day. Some people think technology is a bad thing but it actually does a lot for people and different sitautions in life. Expression can increase your emotion just as simple as a smile or a quick laugh.

Using the Facial Action Coding System could help improve someones emotional state by quickly seeing what their emotions are and if they are feeling down you can give them a hug and increase their emotions. If the Facial Action Coding System was a real life tool we could see many changes in peoples behaviors as well. Having a good behavior can make a good impact on your life and also a good reputation. The world can be seen as a different place if we all have good behaviors and good emotions because people will be a lot respectful and mindful of other human beings.

If someone used the Facial Action Coding System on other artist's pictures they could see how they felt at the time during the picture. Back when Mona Lisa got her picture taken she could have expierenced many emotions and no one truly knew how she was feeling but now that there is technology people easily can tell how she truly felt. As of today many people are left in their feelings and they don't know how to talk about their problems so they just keep them inside. With the technology it would help a lot of people express their feelins without feeling embarassed or scared.",0
"Today, the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. Although it's embarrassing to say, we have grown quite dependent on our phones. Due to this I believe we should be able to use our phones in some form or capacity while in vehicles. There are a multitude of reasons one may need to use their phone while in a car.

One reason they should be able to use their phones while in the car is for navigation. Many people only use their phones for the gps feature. A lot of people have a poor sense of direction or don't know how to read maps. It's also useful if one gets lost and needs help getting out of that situation.

Another reason they should be able to use their phones is in case of emergencies. One might need to alert the authorities for some reason. It could be an accident on the road where the police are needed. There may be a fire in need of firefighters or something along those lines. There's no telling there might even be a need for animal protective services, these things happen.

Although phones shouldnt be used for a lot of things while in the car, this shouldnt expel them from being used in all forms in the car. Accidents may very well happen because of ""text and drivers"", so maybe they shouldn't text and drive. Completely banning cell phones though? That seems to be a stretch. Personally speaking I've lived in Georgia for two years and I still need the GPS to get around. Who has the time or patience to carry a map of georgia and pull it up to read it at every stop sign? The phones still can do alot of good while inside of vehicles. They can be used for emergencies. They can also be used for navigation. They even can just be used as a music player.",0
"A Electoral College is a meeting of thee electors where theey vote for president and vice president. ""The founding fatheers established it in thee constitution as a compromise between election of thee president by a vote in Congress and election of thee President by a vote in Congress and thee election of thee President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" We should keep thee Electoral College because of thee certainty of outcome, theat everyones president and thee swing states. These are some reasons on to keep our despised metheod of thee choosing thee president.

We should keep thee Electoral College because of thee certainty of outcome. The certainty of outcome is a dispute over thee outcome of an Electoral College. According to thee passage "" thee reason is theat thee winning candidates share of thee Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of thee popluar vote."" For examples, President Obama recieved about 62% of thee electoral vote when rodney had about 52% popular votes casted to him. Even a tie is possible because theeres a total of 538 number of votes and its an even number.

Secondly,everyone is president. None if thee regions has enough votes to elect a president so no favorite has power to campaign heavily. So if thee favorite was rodney he will not gain any vote by by increasing his plurality in states theat he knows theat he will win. According to source theree.""thee residents of thee otheer regions are likely to feel disenfranchisedto feel theat theeir votes do not count,theat thee new president will have no regard for theeir interests,theat he really isn't theeir president.""Line 19 This means theat thee people who vote will theink theat its a waste of theeir time since theeir vote will not count. They will be ignored knowing theat theeir vote will have no interest and theat thee president wont really be theier president.

Thirdly, we should keep it because of thee swing states. The swing states is a winnertakeall metheod. Voters will pay more attention to thee campaign because theey know theat theey will decide on thee election. They will be known as thee theoughtful voters because theey will have recieved thee most information and attention and should be thee ones the decide thee election.

Some people might argue about thee disator factor. Its where theere is a tie between thee states. They might say what will happen theen? However, theats why theere is representatives. They break thee tie on who to become president.

In conclusion,we should keep thee Electoral college because of thee certainty of outcome, everyones president and by thee swing states.",0
"Cars most are used by workers, mothers, and pretty much all people in any urban area, they get us from point A to point B. But, as much as we use automobiles do we really need them? They produce smog, endanger our children and folk, and make life more stressing for us all. This can be fixed though, many places around the world have stoped using cars and even went to the length of banning them! Most importantly though they have opened our eyes to the atmospheric destruction that is caused by cars and ways we can do without them.

In Paris, a few days after nearrecord pollution, France banned driving for a couple days to clear the air or drivers will be fined up to 22 euros, or 31 dollars in America. ""Congestion was down 60% in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying in smog that rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world,"" says Robert Duffer, a journalist for Paris Robert Duffer, par. 14. This amazing number just shows how even reducing the use of cars cut back the smog by over half! Imagine what our air could be like if we didn't use cars, it would help the ill and our children could breathe easily. And surprisingly enough, there are places already that do this act of banning cars and enforce it.

In Vauban, Germany there is a community of people who live in this fashion. Street parking, garages, and even driveways at homes are banned from this quaint suburban area. And, if you do own a car you have to pay almost 40,000 to park it, needless to say over 70% of families of the area don't own a car and 57% sold theirs to move to the area. A mother of two and resident of the area, Heidrun Wlater, says, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" Elisabeth Rosenthal par. 3. And true to their word these kinds of urban areas have become popular in Europe and even in New York.

Car free areas have not been limited to just Europe though in America, with its large areas of urban annd suburban ideals, is now changing the way the way we think about cars. In April 2013, the miles driven per person was 9% lower than it was in January 1995 32. Although small, this cultural change in the way we are using cars is significant. Michael Sivak, a research professor at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute says, ""What most intrigues me is that the rates of car ownershipper household and pe person started to come down 2 or 3 years before the downturn, I think that means something more fundamental is going on,"" Elisabeth Rosenthal par. 33. The fact that America is changing the way we use cars is just another indicator that we should stop all together and join this carfree revolution.

To wrap it up, cars are hurting the air and they need to be cut back before we burn a hole through our atmoshpere. We're not alone in this carfree quest, many areas Europe and nothern America have started to implement this way of thinking. And lastly, this ideal is most needed in America's packed cities, the hazzard of smog and other pollution is hurt our citizens and needs to be stoped before it has longterm effect on our children. Please consider this, car in the long run are bad for the economy but, as well our health. It's snowing on Mt. Fuji.",0
"Imagine a classroom specifically tailored to each individual student and their emotion. The students there enjoy coming to school. If they are bored, the lesson changes to regain their interest. If they are confused, the lesson uses a different method of explaining to help them better understand what is being taught. The article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" describes a new emotion-recognition software that could do just that. The use of technology to read emotion is valuable and should be used classrooms.

The technology that is used currently in schools could be bettered using this new software. Throughout the United States, many schools are looking for solutions to better their classrooms. Emotion-recognition could be the answer. Most schools already have devices in place such as lap-tops, iPads, and classroom computers. With technology already in schools, why not strive to make it better? The only step that would need to be taken is putting these softwares in place.

Students could have more enjoyment and better understanding in schools with emotion detecting softwares. Those who find it hard to pay attention could recieve lessons that are constantly changing. Students that are having a difficult time with a particular portion or subject could recieve help. Even those who are commonly bored in school could be given more challanging lessons to keep their interest up, simply through emotion-recognition.

With happier kids and more personalized instruction, student's success in school could increase. If children had a more positive experience in school, they could enjoy learning more. If students enjoyed learning more, they might have more motivation to do well in school. Also, each individual student would be given instruction tailored to them, so no student would be left behind or have less oportunity to succeed than others.

Overall, the use of emotion detecting technology is valuable and should be used in classrooms. Technology is already being used in schools, so all that would have to be done is putting the new software in place. Increases in student enjoyment while at school could greatly effect the levels of student success, leading to a smarter generation of motivated and positive individuals. If a change that is not difficult to make, could have such a great impact, why is it not in place already?",0
"Numerous amount of people would love to experience the opportunities of limiting their time with their car. There are a great amount of advantages of limiting car usage. Advantages include having a more healthy environment, decreasing stress, and reducing traffic.

The advantages of limiting car usage is helping the environment. ""passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States."" While most of the adult population is driving cars everyday, more gas and smoke go into the air and into our environment. This causes pollution and hurts our environment. Paris has a major smog problem in their environment, up to the point where it was nearrecorded. Paris had to then enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of the city. The effect of this ban was that congestion was down 60 percent and the smog cleared after a short week. If we were able to limit our car usage, then our greenhouse gas emissions would decrease. ""In the United States, the environmental protection agency is promoting car reduced communities, and legislators are starting to act."" There are numerous environmental agencies that are already starting to act to decrease the car usage in the country. We should limit our car usage because it can greatly help our environment.

If were able to limit our car usage, then it will greatly decrease our stress of driving. Many countries are trying to reduce car usage. An example is Columbia. Columbia has created a carfree day. ""Millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses during carfree day, leaving the streets eerily devoid of traffic jams."" Bogota, Colombia have practiced this day for three years and many colombians have been pleased with it. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"", said businessman Carlos Plaza. Without driving, you have the time to go out, be active and get exercise. A huge effect of the car free day is that park and sport centers have been built all throughout Bogota, smoother sidewalks, and rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic. With car usage reduced, it limit people's stress on driving.

If we were able to lower the number of car usage, then our streets would be much safer and there would be less traffic. Many people use cars today and because of that most of streets are usually blocked up. If there were less cars on the streets then it would be easier and quicker to go to places. Vanban, Germany is an example of an carfree town. ""...basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls alond some distant highway."" With less cars on the streets, it can also reduce car accidents and deaths. If there were less cars on the roads, there would be less traffic and car accidents.

There are many advantages of limiting our car usage. These advantages include helping our environment, decreasing stress, and making our roads safer with less traffic.",0
"The author states at the very end of the passage, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"". That is powerful. He is explaining that just because we do stuff here on Earth, or just because we find something out does not mean that we stop there. It means we strive and conquer our mission to do more, and here's why.

The scientists want samples, however, that would be very risky. Despite the risks, scientists would have to get up close and personal with Venus. They personally know that there are a lot of risks getting close to Venus. They mentioned that it could melt a spacecraft in a matter of a couple hours. However, they are determined. The author mentioned Venus had a lot of ""value"", he also stated, ""not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors"". This has meaning, and what it means is that not only do the scientists want to know about Venus and their ideas may lead to exploring Venus , but human curiosity will also take over and other people will want to know about Venus as well.

In conclusion, Scientists want to know and explore Venus, and normal people are going to want to understand and learn about Venus as well. The scientists need this information to further the progression of learning and experimenting with Venus. They are probably going to do whatever it takes to learn about Venus, despite the dangers and fatal risks of going there. They will more than likely one day get there, but there will probably be a lot of trial and error along the way.",0
"Some people think that asking for more than one persons advice is a good thing to do, while others would argue that you should only ask one person for their advice. I personally think that asking more than one person for advice is always the right way to go. Some people can give better advice than others can, some people know you better than others, and would know the best advice for you, and because it is always good to see more than one persons perspective. If you only have one person giving you advice then you would only see where that one person is coming from and just automatically just take their advice.

One reason why you should ask more than one person for advice is because some people can give better advice than others. Some people are more familiar with things that go on in life than others because they have been around longer. A lot of people could have experiences with something you need advice for, so all that you would have to do is ask them for their advice and they could easily help you out. Many people have different thoughts and opinions than others do. It is important to hear a lot of peoples advice so that you can put all the advice that you are given together, and then easily solve your problem. Asking more than one person for their advice is a good choice because some people give better advice than others, and it is always a good thing to do because it helps you out the most.

Another reason why you should ask more than one person for their advice is because some people know you better than others. Some people know your life choices and know your personality way better than others do. If you ask someone you are close with for their advice, that is probably going to be the best advice that you get, just because they know who you are as a person. On the other hand, if you were to ask someone who you are not that close with for their advice it might be the total opposite from what the person who you are close with gave you. If you are not close with someone that gives you advice then it most likely will not be the best thing to listen to, just because they do not know you that well. If you ask more than one person then it would be very helpful because you could hear what everyone has to say, and then you can decide which advice you want to take. Asking more than one person for their advice is a good choice because some people know you better than others, and it is very helpful to you so that you can have lots of options.

The last reason why you should ask more than one person for their advice is because it is good to see more than one persons perspective. Some people might think of something that you ask them one way, but others could see it a total different way. Not all people think the same way as everyone. Someone could say something and someone else could take what that person said and come up with a lot of their own thoughts. Even some people have thoughts could be the total opposite of what the person said actually mean't. If you look at something one way you would automatically jump to conclusion that, that is what it is, but if you look at something more than one way, then you get to see all the different perspectives about it. Asking more than one person for their advice, because you get to see a lot of more peoples perspectives, is a good thing to do because you get to see more thoughts and it will help you out a lot more.

To conclude that asking for more than one persons advice is a very good choice because some people can give better advice than others can, some people know you better than others do, and seeing more than one persons perspective, are very helpful to you as a person because you get to have multiple options, and get to see where multiple people are coming from. Asking for more than one persons advice is the best thing you can do when you are struggling in life and need some help.",0
"One topic that is frequently debated today is if schools should be allowed to control students involvement in extracurricular activities. They think that sometimes students take too many extracurricular activities to the point that they do not have enough time to do their school work. They feel that extracurricular activities don't help students manage their time wisely. I believe the decision regarding extracurricular activities should be left to the students because it helps students learn how to manage their time, make new friends, and it helps students make colleges be interested in them.

Firstly extracurricular activities helps students learn how to manage their time. It helps students learn how to manage their time by making them make a schedule. By making a schedule students learn how hard it is to an adult. Students make resposible actions and learn how much work they have to put in for them to be good in school. Extracurricular activities doesn't always take studenst time but prepares them for life

Secondly extracurricular activities helps students learn how to make new friends. Extracurricular activities helps students how to communicate and make new friends while making good memories. Students shouldn't always be focused in school I believe that students should also have fun and friends. Friends will make school and other school related activities enjoyable for kids and teengers.

Lastly extracurricular activities helps students make colleges be interested in them. Colleges get interested in you when they see all of the thinggs you've done althrought high school. If colleges see that you've a lot throught high school they would be even more interested in you. Colleges also check your grades and other stuff but the thing they check the most is extracurricular activities because they want to see if you were consistant.

As you have read I believe the decision regarding extracurricular activities should be left to the students because it helps students learn how to manage their time, make new friends, and it helps students make colleges be interested in them. Only when we let our students choice they would resposible and wise. When that day comes our students will be great and mature.",0
"I thinkl that you should keep electoral college because qualified citizens chose it obvisliy. But besides that reason you should have it's a easy compromise to vote. It helps you choose your state's electors when you vote for president because you are actullay voting for your candidates electors. Under the system of electoral college voters vote not for presdint ,but for a slate of electors instead. It could help us undersatnd voting for our electors if you keep electoral voting. Even though some say that this was the 2000 fisaco was the biggest election crisis in a century. The system could of had worse. I think it helps with voting more than anything else instead of the online voting for the slate electors.

Some also so it should be abloished and that it's unfair and very irrantional, it has helped more than do any damage to any other type of voting like that tabs we once used to vote for everything. We should keep it because of its certanity of outcome because it helps when there is a tie on voting. ""Swing States"" are anthor reason because of the winner takes all method we sawin 2012's election to focus their campaign efforts on the  toss up states ,it help us out because at the end of paragraph 20 it says the most thoughful voters should be the ones to decide the election with electoral college.  It does also big states electoral college restores some of the weigth in the political balance that large states lose by virtue.

It does also help with run-off elections it helps avoid the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. It says that it may turn off voters for a candidate who has no hopes of carrrying their state. Those are my reasons why you shouldn't  get rid of electoral voting hopfully you will condsier it.",0
"The author suggetsts that studying the harsh planet of Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. However, the author does not provide ENOUGH information to be convincing. In paragraph 7, it states that ""simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulation the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions"" this shows some insightful information, but there should also testing of more complicated and complex electronics and equipment. Another method the author claims is using a mechanical computer to handle the conditions. It's a good method, but it doesn't support HOW it can be used on Venus. The last method is using a blimp/plane-like aircraft to monitor Venus. It's a great method to study more about the atmosphere, but as it states ""reasearchers cannot take samples of rock, gas , or anything else, from a distance"" hindering the option of a thorough mission. The author has some great claims, but needs to go more in-depth as to what some of the mentioned methods will do and how they will potentially work on Venus.",0
"Essay: Phones & Driving

Should drivers have there phones with them while driving or not? With all honesty, there are only a few people who doesn't have a phone. But, the majority of humans on this planet has a phone on them. Drivers should not have a phone in their disposal, no matter who it is. With deaths coming from young teen drivers, because we just have to look at our phone from: every phone call, or notification that vibrates in our pockets. We are humans who are still curious with the world around us, but with the mini-computer in our pockets we can see everything, with just a swipe of a tap or swipe of a finger. Now with drivers using their phone while driving, it will leave detrimental pain to families that are struck with the news that their son or family member is now dead. So, phones should never be used while driving, because drivers die from being distracted from their phone on the passenger seat or middle console.

The World Wide Web is a social area where everyone can connect and communicate. But it will distract the mind just as a man to a very attractive female, and be only fixated on the one subject for as long as they could. ""Texting while driving has become the number one driving distraction for many people.""(http://www. donttextdrive. com) In the article it states that:""Drivers

Woodhouse 2

need to be aware of the dangers and keep their attention on the road, not on their cell phones or other mobile devices.""(donttextdrive. com) Now with those facts, others would pull up that: what if is an important call? Or Someone was in danger, and the one to call is nowhere to be found? But that is no excuse to be distracted just for one text or call.

Teens use their phone on an average of nine hours a day, just on social media and other apps they use. That more hours wasted on the news on in the morning, or time for studying for a test, or time to focus on the road to prevent an accident from happening. But teens aren't known to the fact that they should watch the road and drive safely. Now and days the quote: ""At least 3,000 teens die each year from accidents caused by texting and driving, and another 300,000 are injured.""(thezebra. com/insurance-news/76/teens-texting-and-driving) That's too many deaths and it has increased over the years. Not excluding the adults but mainly, teens are on the phone the most for obvious reasons. That's the reason why teens shouldn't have their phone with them as they drive.

As you're driving; you're focused on one thing, that's on the road and your destination. But if you have your phone in the passenger seat or in the middle console, and you hear the notification ringtone, then your off task on what you need to focus on. You will lose all concentration, even if you keep looking back and forth on the road and the phone. As your looking back and forth, just in a split second looking away a car will be speeding past a red light and you didn't see it coming. Next thing you know your in the hospital clinging on to life not knowing what's happening with the world around you.

Woodhouse 3

Just over one text you had to send back that instant, without putting your life on the line first. There are cars that will allow you to use your voice to send a message or talk while driving without using your hands. But certain people don't have the money or credit to be able to afford cars to be able to do that.

In closing, you can see common sense should kick in to not reply to a text message or phone call while driving. It will cause: death, severe injuries, or damage to vehicles, and a court date. We shouldn't use our phones while driving because of those and another reason such as: it can cause damage to our eyes and won't be able to see properly. Now people, as I said before, they would disagree with this reason as for their jobs or a loved one that was in the hospital. That is fine and all, but that isn't an excuse to use to for hitting a car and killing someone in the process just over a text. You shouldn't use your phone of course while driving that's just not smart, come on use the sense that God gave you.

"Car usage around the world has skyrocketed pollution levels tenfold. In Paris, France they had to ban driving for 2 days to help clear out the fog in the city (Source 2). Some cities have even stopped using cars altogether, many of the townspeople believe that cars just cause more stress in peoples lives (Source 1).

In Colombia, the Day Without Cars is becoming more and more popular each year. It's a great way to lower stress and air pollution (Source 3)!

Since 2005, car usage in America has gone down every year, with less people getting a license and less cars being bought each year (Source 4). It begs the question: are cars growing away from our culture? Many people would rather use public transportation or car-pool with friends than drive to work or other activities. Public transportation traffic is woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety (Paragraph 43).

So maybe you should ask yourself if driving really is the best way to go, because it only causes stress, pollution, and it's a danger to your safety every time you drive onto the road. Maybe it's just best to limit car usage and pull out the old bicicle or take the bus and meet new people.",0
"If you think the face in mars was created by aliens your wrong. Am about to tell you why your wrong. Am also going to convince you that the face is just a natural landform.

First of all the first picture was blury but we took new ones and they are better.''Michael malin and his mars orbiter camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the orinal viking photos''.The camera also can see anything if ther was life down ther. Michael malin also said ''as a rule of thumb you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,''he added.''So if ther were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks,you could see what they were!""

In the passage it says that the face is nothing but a land scape form""what the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of butte or mesa-landforms common around the american west. This also happens on earth sometimes. ""It reminds me most of middle butte in the snake river plain of idaho""says Garvin.

So if you still think that the martian land form, as it should be called,was created by aliens, than think twice because thats all the information i need to prove you wrong.",0
"The author does not support his idea well. He talks about more of the cons than the pros of visiting Venus, and not really about how serious this trip could be if we do the trip. He thinks that because it was once a planet like Earth that it would still be safe, yet it is very dangerous. It is more dangerous than safe. No spacecraft has survived the landing of the trip, so what expects the author to assume people will. Right, he thinks by studying more about Venus, and building protection machines will help, but with the weather of Venus it will most likely get destroyed.

The author does not supposrt his self much by saying it is the hottest, had a lot of water, and 97% acid . More sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. He saying that it was also onece like Earth, which is a good thing, but Venus is not Earth much anymore. The text states, ""Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting vlocanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on it is suface."" So either way you are basically die having to go to Venus. He listed some more than bad. The fact that it is the hottest planet in our earth system is not good. Some of the good of having to exolore Venus is that it is sometimes our closer option to spce traveling, but a sad part is that there is a insisputable ways of you returuning.

If you do end up making it to Venus and landing, there's and small chance of you dying by the weather there.

The author did not support his idea because he put more of the cons into the article than the pros. He did have some pros, but they did not really halp with the argument because the cons just ruled over them. He should have done more research on the pros, or listed less cons. In the last paragraph, 8, the author states, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"" is technically not true. It is not true because if you are willing to out a life in a rocket and not have any doubts is scary. You are gonna have doubts, but it is not as though you want to have them. You do not want someone to loose their life because you did not care. By having doubts, you are pretty much shwing you care, and that you do not want anything to go wrong. By having dangers, in a way helps us to know how to be safe. So, there is nothing wrong with doubts and dangers because those keep us safe.",0
"Have you seen the Face on Mars? It was twenty five years ago when NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars and snapped a photo of a landform that looked much like a human face. We, NASA, have noticed many people made conspiracy theories about the Face being made by aliens. We assure you this is not true. NASA wishes that there was an acient civilization on Mars that constructed the Face. The Face is a natural landform.

The Face is not an alien monument. Eighteen long years after the first mission and the first photograph was taken, Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at the Red Planet in September, 1997. Chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, Jim Garvin explained that we felt this was important to taxpayers, so we photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it. On April 5, 1998, MGS finally flew over the Face and snapped a photo ten times shaper than the orginal. This photo revealed a natural landform. If aliens did create the Face, there would be other clearer signs of alien work. For example, there would be huts, small shack figures or even Egyptain-style pyramids. Therefore, there was no alien monument after all, but not everyone was satisfied, so in 2001, NASA got another photo of it, much clearer and closer this time. It was still just a natural landform.

NASA went through a lot to get the three photos of the Face. The first one in 1976, the second in 1998, and the third in 2001. These three photos have shown everyone very clearly that the Face on Mars is a natural landform. Some even say it reminds then of a butte or mesa, landforms common around the American West. In conclusion, the Face on Mars is, in fact, a natural landform.",0
"Twenty five years ago NASA Viking 1 spacecraft was looking for somwhere to land on Mars for Viking 2 when it sppoted a showdow that looked like a face. The enoemous head was nearly two miles from end to end. The facewas just a natural landform.

Only few scientists believe the Face was an alien artifact. But the article states that when NASA unvieled the image for all to see, the caption that went with it noted a "" huge rock formation... which resembled a human head... formed by shadows giving an illution of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Also in the article it says the author even reasoned ""it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention on mars"".

The fact that when the face appeared on the Jet Propultion Lab monitors was short lived also proves that it wasn't a alien because if it was they would have probably started doing test and research on it right away or if not right away then soon.

On April5, 1998, when Mars GlobalSurveyor flew over it for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took a picture ten times sharpper than the orginal photo revealed it was just a natural landform. There was no alien monument.

Of course not everyone was happy. It's much cooler to have it be a alien artifact than a natural landform. People weren't giving up. The face is located 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter of April 98' when the camera on bored of MGS had to peer through clouds to see the face. Skeptics said the alein markings were hidden by haze.

Mission controlers prepared to look again. The article states that ""we just don't pass over the face very often"".

On April 8, 2001, it was acloundless summer day; the Mars Global Surveyer drew close enough for a second look. In the image things were three times bigger than the Vikings one so you could easily see if there were shacks or small airplanes.

What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa. These are landforms common around the American West.

This all proves that the so called ""Face on mars"" was just a landform and not from alien artifacts. The shadows from the landforms made it appear to look like a face but it was just a cauincedince.",0
"Yes I am for technology to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom.

The reasonn why I said yes is because. Kids have changed, we dont like certain stuff, teachers think the kids are feeling good in class but on the inside could be the Devil and God fighting. The world is changing the future of America, and the schools should do something about it.

(Imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions.) ''From the article''.

Us kids sit in a building for 7 hours and 30 minutes. There is no excuse for a kid to feel like he is forced to come to school. School should feel like home, it should be a place to go to get away from bad things in your life. Me personally, I dislike school, yeah we learn the material but not everybody learns the material. Some people come here just so they have food in their stomachs. Some kids come here for relationships. Some kids come to school for fun. Thats wrong. Kids should come to learn. Learn different ways learn life materials, learn how to work with people, learn how to be great citizens.

(''A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,'' Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson like a effective human instuctor.) (From the Article).

I love my education . But I love my country more. The way I look at school is disgusting a descrace. The people that gave this stupid test. Should get fired. Istep shouldn't determine if I graduate. It shouldnt detemine if im smart or not. it shouldnt be based on a national level. It should be a state thing. You know why? Let me tell you why. The stuff i learn in Geometry and in English. Are not on ISTEP. This test is basically a test that we dont study for, and it really does suck that this test determines if I graduate. Its unfair.

Hopefully you take what I said to the heart and look at what America is in 5 to 10 years. Because this technology would change everything. Teachers would understand there students more. Teachers would grow that father/mother role to the students. Kids would feel more comfortable with there teachers knowing how they feal. Thank you for taking your time to reading my Essay.",0
"Have you ever asked advice from anyone? How many times have you asked? Asking advice is pretty important if you're one of those people that depend on people to make your decisions. But why should we ask multiple people for advice?

Well lets start off by how advice is important. Advice is a suggestion or recommendation that a person gives to you in order help in your decision-makings. It can affect your life greatly by which choices you make. So that's why it's important to get feedback from multiple people. Once you have gathered information from other people, you can compare other people's responses with others to see what would be good or bad. One example was when I asked my friends which sports I should play. I came up to at least 10 or more of my friends for advice. Then I compared some answers with others. And it seems that a lot of people thought I was good a Basketball. So I tried it out, and it was the perfect sports for me. But still, why should we ask multiple people for advice?

We rely on others everyday in our lives. Either by life choices or just helping people. There are many ways to help people, but we mostly help people with advice. Asking several different people is a great way to get advice. You could ask you parents, friends, uncles, anybody! Recently, I went on a trip to the mountains. I was either deciding if I wanted to ski or snowboard when I got there. Wasn't sure of my decisions, I asked my family members and friends. out of 8, 6 said skiing because it was easy and it was my first time. So I agreed. Opinions can vary when asking many different people. It's good to ask for many different opinions. Otherwise you won't come out with a good outcome. Another example could be during science class. Sometimes you have to try the experiment 50 times in order to make your final outcome or decision.

Why should we ask multiple people for advice? How does it benefit you? As a result of asking many people for their opinion, many people have matured in life making better choices. This benefits us as a person when we grow up to make our own decisions. So that's why advice can really be important in tough choices. So always try to get advice from your peers when you need it.",0
"Living in a community without the use of cars can be extremely beneficial. It might seem odd to say such an idea because we have lived in towns with alot of car usage all of our lives. Heidrun Walter said, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Not having a car can be very stressless. This is because you do not have to worry about wrecking your car, keeping up with the insurance payments, talking care of it (such as oil changes) and eventually, having to buy a new one which can be very expensive.

Another reason why not having a car is beneficial is that it can help the enviornment. Right now, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of Greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. This number keeps on climbing because more and more people are buying cars which just puts more gas into the enviornment.

An even greater benefit of living in a community without cars is that you can get more excercise. Sitting in the car everyday going to and from work for 2 hours is not being productive. However, in the existing car-free communities, all the necessary store are in walking or biking distance from the majority of the population. So, the commute to work for most people can be just like getting a daily exercise and staying in shape.

In conclusion, I firmly beleive that living in a community without cars would be a change for the better. It would help with everyones finanical situations and everyone would have better health because you would have to bike and walk everywhere. As of lately, it has seemed like less and less people have started to use cars. The number of miles drivn peaked in 2005 and has been dropping since. In April, 2013 the average number of miles driven was 9 percent below the peak in 2005.",0
"Many people loves libreries, and they enjoy to share time with family,they will like to be like back in those days. Technology allow poeple to complete many task without having contact with others. Technology have a negative effect in people life because people life is passing in front of their face without knowing, technology hurts people in many ways,and make many people to feel bad with themself.

Some people think that technology is the best creation that the human ever made because entertain and hepl people to understand many things. Others believe that technology is a easy way to make assigments because google have every kind of information. Still other argue that without technology this world would not be the same because doctors would never find the tratment for the sickness.

Technology have a negative effect in people life because they forget to live their life and the time is passing, just because they spend all their time playing video games, in the phone, and they star to getting older and because the years are passing like nothing and really fast that when they react they would see that their best years just passing, without enjoy their time with the people that they love. Many people just react only when one family member death and they start to think that life is too short, and it is why people need to apreciate and enjoy,

learn new thing, meet new places, have more experiences, and also meet new people and learn good thing from them.

Many people hurt them self in many ways for example physical and mental because physical they star to get fat and then they do not take care about their healty and if they do not take care who else would do for them, because when they star to get sick they just do not care about it, because they want to keep concentrate in their video games or telephone. metal many people just not care about their future and goals, because they are really busy thinking how to get the most advance technology device and who is usining in where they go. many people do not take care about their personal life and after few years later when the affected would be them because they did not care about their future they would have nothing and the technnology every year change, and get new devices. People need to think about what is most important something else that is really important and needed or a device that in few months would be betters phone and other devices, because for example whe a phone just come out every one want to buy and the price is more than $1000 and after few monts the price is more lower and they have another new phone, it is in what people want to spend money and time, first think and later act after they know is the best.

Technology makes people to feel bad about themselves because now people believe everything that is posted in internet, only because some people said it ect. Other make their self look better in the phone and when they look their self in the mirror they hate their self, and sometimes people look other people in internet that they post picture they want to be like them and they star to despreviate their self and start to search in google how to change or do something they can not do it or does not work they get depress, stressful and tired of their life that sime search the easy way, that many people and doing in other country that is kill their self, so technology just affect people in many ways.

Technology affect people in a negative way because people spend too much time on techonology and life is just passing. Technology is taking over people, and into they get hurt with something or someone that they love they start to see that they was doing wrong, they get dissapoinment with themselves for being so stuped, people need to use less phone and spend more time with family and enjoy every second of life because life is just one and is really short.

"If we never do anything about the air pollution coming from cars will the human race last a long time? If you had to choose from killing yourself slowly or making the world healthier by walking instead of taking a car what would you choose? Many people don't understand the damage that driving all of the time is doing to our world. But, limiting car usage has many advantages that come along with it.

Limiting car usage come along with many advantages. One advantage of limiting car usage is that you can limit the amount of smog that goes into the air and also into your lungs. In source 2 it says, ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine31."" That is a very good choice of action because without hearing that they would have any consequences people still would have drove their cars. In source 2 it also says, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog..."" So, by limiting car usage just by the even numbered license plates there was less smog in just one day. In source 2 it says, ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday."" So, the success of just one day made people want to do it a second day with just the oddnumbered license plates. If they keep this up and eventually have a day where neither odd nor even numbered license plates can drive the smog will eventually clear all the way up.

Also, another advantage to limiting car usage is there won't be many traffic jams. In source 3 it says, ""In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams,"" meaning that everyone got around easily without all of the congestion in the roads. In source 3 it also says, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said the businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a twoseat bicycle with his wife."" Traffic jams tend to cause alot of people stress. People stress because they can't get to important places on time, they spend hours on the same highway, etc. By limiting car usage, they limit their stress and have a good day instead of being so angry just because of traffic which will help them out in the long run because alot of stress isn't good for the body.

There are many more advantages to limiting car usage. In source 4 it says, ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" By just taking the little time to figure out a different, less polluting way of transportation all of these advantages come out of it.

Many people don't understand the damage that driving all of the time is doing to our world. But, limiting car usage has many advantages that come along with it. A way that I could pitch in would be to ride the school bus with everybody else instead of driving myself to school. Some advantages to that would be using less gas, saving money and carpooling so that there are less cars on the road and less air pollution, because we need the air to stay clean so we can breathe and stay alive. So by limiting car usage we can have many good things happen to our lives and to our world.",0
"The face on Cydonia isn't made by aliens because there is no life on Cydonia, the Jet Propulsion Lap were happy, and the face is equivalent tolandformin the American West.

Cydonia has no life living there. It became main priority to NASA in September of 1997. This Red planet became the priority because they have captured a photo of what looked like a face. Although int he passage scientist state that they thought it was just anouther Martian mesa.

Back at the controllers Jet Propulsion Lab the passage says that the face apeared on there monitors. It was a sensationto the lap and the scientist even thought it was shortly lived. Common around Cydonia they thought it was just anouther Martian mesa. After afewdays NASA unveiled the image of the face to the puplics eye.

The picture of the face on Cydonia shows that it was/is equivalent to a buttle or mesa. Jim Garvin said "" It reminds me most of Middle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.""At one point Garvin also said the dome takes the form of an isolated mesa, almost the same height as the face. If there was aliens on the Red planet you could see them. A picture taken was able to be as clear as possble.

I see where people would think the face was made by aliens. Yes, we don't know if there really is life on Mars. Some scientist belive the face was an alien artifact. Skepticals said perhaps alien markings were hiddenby a haze. But, there will not be life on Mars until NASA says so.

There isnt life on Mars. If you have proof then show NASA if they belive it then isuppose there is life being lived on Mars.",0
"On my experiences I think It would be impossible to change the first impressions becuase one different people have different types of characteristics traits. For example one of my friend who move to text,her characteristic traits I remember she was so nice to everybody when she use to live her in virginia and also she use to get along with everbody at the school. This shows that type of impressions that my friend Generic_Name has.

Another example is when I was in lunch line with my friend Generic_Name,a spanish girl touch my hair,I did not know that girl was the girlfriend of the boy that was in one of my class. Until then when I was going to my third class I ask that boy if he could help me find this class because I did not know where all my classes were,when he came up to me to explain the schuedule and told me and him had the same class,his girlfriend look at me mad. This shows that at first the girl of the boy was nice and then the girl of the boy was kind of mean to mean.

Last example everbody has different types of impressions,it could be in a good way or bad way. Sometimes people impressions might change or they might still be the same.",0
"Homework can be hard most of the time, and you need someone to help you with it. Having an afterschool homework club can be fun and a good thing to do in school. An afterschool homework club can be good for the kids that don't get to finish their homework or don't understand the homework. On the other hand, we have the people that don't have time to do things after school.

An after school homework club would not be good for some of the students. People don't always have the time to do something after school. They have other things that they have to do like, practicing for a sport, dance, sing, learning an instrument it could be anything the problem is that they don't have enough time to do homework, even when they get home. An afterschool homework club is good for the kids that don't have nothing to do for the afternoon so they can stay and finish homework from that day or something that they need to finish.

I am one of those people who is against the afterschool homework club. Sometimes I need to go to preactice, so I don't have time to finish my homework but, I try my best to finish it and turn in the homework the next day. Teachers might don't have the time to stay after school too, because they have things to do like if they have a pet they have to give it food so it won't starve or have kids and they need to take care of them so nothing bad happens to them. So that is another reason why they should not have afterschool homework club.

Most of the students won't have a ride back home because their parents can be working, they can be sick, or they are not home. I don't think the school is gonna take care of all the students that go to the afterschool homework club. That is another reason why afterschool homework club is not good. What if the kids get hungry while begin in the afterschool homework club. I don't think the school is going to have food. If the school is thinking about making a club they could make it at the last class so the students take that block so they can only do homework.

It would be better if the school makes the club at the last class of the day so the students take that block for only to finish homework. So the students that don't have time after school won't struggle about not finishing their homework at time because, they have other activities to do after school. It could be good too so everyone can take a little break of the day they had. This could help a lot so, if theachers have things to do like, grade papers or homework to check they can take that block to do all of that.

Another good idea could be, that they can make the club at fist block, at the start of the day, like if one of the students never did their homework last night they still have time to finish it in the morning before they go to class. My favorite one was the one in the last class because, everyone gets a little break even the teachers. Everyone gets to finish their homework and no one has worrys about not finishing their homework and have a little bit of more free time in the afternoon.",0
"For the past few years, people have come to theories that the Electoral College is flawed. Citizens have come to this conclusion due to the fact that Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and AFLCIO, all agreed to abolish the electoral college. Also, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind the U.S. is using now. Finally, under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who then, in turn, elect the president. The election system should be changed to popular vote for the President of the United States because the system is more reliable, and the president is chosen by the people.

Due to past problems in the Electoral College, people can come to a conclusion and say that the popular vote system is more reliable. As mentioned in Source 2, Bradford Plumer says that, ""The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century the system allows for much worse."" The Electoral College was to be blamed when in 2000, the electors defied the will of the people. On the contrary, as stated in Source 1, ""The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" Even the Founding Fathers believed in the vote from the people to elect their leader, but it has shifted away from it.

It was always believed that the people elected the president, but it has been proved that it isnt that way. As mentioned in Source 3, ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide and election."" Due to the Electoral College, voters, knowing their vote will have no effect, will have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were chosen by popular vote. This shows that if citizens knew that their votes were for voting for someone to elect their president, they would lose interest and stop voting.

Overall, the popular vote system is more reliable because of the vote of the citizens, rather from a slate of electors. Also, it was believed that people elected the president, but in reality, people voted for electors to vote for their president. Next, the Electoral College has many flaws, one of them being that the electors defy the will of the people. And also, that electors may be replaced on purpose to go against a candidate. Finally, the Electoral College should be abolished because it is unfair, outdated, and irrational.",0
"Making this use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable because some students like to keep their emotions to thereselves. Another reason is some students have more of a serious face so you can't tell their emotions. Last reason is people have mixed emotions.

Some people like to keep their emotions to their selves because they dont want people to know whats going on. An example from the article is ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communcation."" This means that some human don't like to communcate especially with their emotions.

Some students have more of a serious face, so you cant tell whether their happy or sad. An example from the passage is ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" This means that you can tell when a person is happy or sad, but some people can have serious face, but can really be happy in the inside.

Some people have mixed emotions. which means like mood swings etc. An example from the passage is ""By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions."" This means that the person can either be sad, happy, serious, or mad.

Therefore the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of stuudents in a classroom is not valuable because some students want to keep their emotions to their selves.",0
"Dear our state Senator,

I am writing to you for not only myself but for the citizens of our state. I do not agree with The Electoral College and I think that our way of voting for president should be based off of popular vote. I know our state and our country has been using electoral college as our way of voting for a very long time throughout our nations history. But Electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrrational. and i'll tell you whats wrong with the electoral college.

As you may know we do not directly vote for our president. we vote for our electors who will (hopefully) vote for the president we want. when the time comes for voting the state legislature are technically responsible for picking our electors. We the people are not always in control of who they vote for and the electors could always defy our will. We do not always control who they vote for. So is it really fair if we vote for an elector who doesnt even support us and our say in who we want to lead our country?

Another reason why i do not agree with the electoral college is for the smaller states. they do not have as much of a say in who runs our country like we do. luckily we are one of the biggest states along with california. but in smaller states they almost have no say at all. they dont even see campaigns because no one running for office pays attention to the smaller states. For instance, The campaign in 2000 seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all.

One of the biggest faults in the electoral college even though it is very unlikely but not impossible is a tie. As you already know if there was a tie the election would be thrown to the house of representatives,where state delegations vote on the president. because each state casts only one vote, the houses selections would hardly even show the will of the people. the people would barely have any say whatsoever. does that seem fair to you?

Those are the reasons why i and many other citizens do not agree with the elecotral college. its unfair to us , the people, and smaller states. America is known for being the country of freedom and choice, but if we the people barely have say in who runs our country, are we really elligble to be called that? thats why i think we should use popular vote as our way of electing our president.",0
"If someone wishes to travel somewhere, such as a normal commute, proably the first transportation method they think of is a car. Cars are everywhere. They're the things hiding in a home, waiting for someone to enter the depths of the dark garage. Unless the grage is truly empty of the world-killing machiene, such as in Vauban, Germany where people have done the unthinkable: got rid off cars.

Though it may sound proposterous, or even critically insane to even concider giving up a car, the citizens of Vauban are a lot happier to be rid of the burden. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happpier this way"" (Rosenthal, In German Suburb, Life goes On Without Cars). As you may have forgotten, car payments, maintnance, check up, oil changes, and gas are all part of owning a car which may be a financial strain for most.

Again, those robots that you move with pedals and a steering wheel are seriously affecting our Earth. We're Earth murderers. ""Passenger cars arw responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"" (Rosenthal, In German Suburb, Life goes On Without Cars). Fellow humans, we are not the only species on planet Earth. We are so used to cars it's like watching something interesting on TV and trying to pull away from it; it's nearly impossible. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clean the air of the global city"" (Duffer, Paris bans driving due to smog). Less driving cars is less greenhouse gasses that destroy our Earth.

In our society today, cars are the dominant transportation method. When you go outside in today's world it is most likely not the sound of nature, but a manmade vehicle. Without cars, a whole new world will come forth, or most likely the beautiful world we forgot about that is mercilessly trapped beneath unessesary layers of greenhouse gases. When Paris banned cars, it improved the pollution stuck in the air. ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French part to recind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday"" (Duffer, Paris bans driving due to smog). If we stop driving cars, it will help most people financially, help our Earth, and ease the worry and stress over the maintenance of a car. Once again, we are not the only species on Earth. Can't we all just share?",0
"The use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuble because teachers and other students can tell how a student may feel. It is important to know how someone is feeling so they can get counciling if needed, or so they can cheer up others. It's also important to be able to recognize facial expressions and the different types of muscle movements. This new type of technology can also be used to improve school systems. The Facial Action Coding System is of value to use on reading students' emotions.

The Facial Action Coding System can regonize how a student may be feeling. This could be beneficial for teachers and councilors because then they could help the student with any emotional problems they may be having. The technology, ""can even identify mixed emotions"". Mixed emotions can show a mix of happiness and sadness at the same time because people's emotions aren't always clear, and people can appear as something they are not. Facial expressions for each and every emotion are diverse.

Recognizing facial expressions and different muscle movements can help determine how someone is feeling. Instead of, ""we humans perform(ing) this same impressive ""calculation"""", we humans can use a more reliable source. The Facial Action Coding System can, ""handle the complex algorithms used to decode"". It can, ""indicate the difference between a geniune smile and a forced one."" Having this in a classroom can tell what students are actually feeling, and we humans wouldn't have to be forced to guess.

This type of technology can improve how schools work. If, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"", then a teacher or staff member can better help that student or excite the class. Or, ""it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". The learning process can be made more entertaining and enriching to students.

Having technology to read students' emotional expressions in school is vauble. It can determine if a student has mixed emotions and needs a councilor, it can calculate how a student honestly feels, and it can improve school systems by giving more attention to those who are troubled or bored. This technological system can be beneficial and vauble.",0
"As technology advances, people become notorious for using their electronics in inappropriate situations. Teenagers in present day commonly text at the dinner table, while crossing a street, and even while driving. Not only do teenagers text, their parents do, as well. Texting is a frequent fad among the young adults, it also a convenient method for parents to keep in contact with their children. People nowadays have to be in contact with friends and family at every moment of the day especially while driving it is the equivalent of driving under the influence, using hand-held devices (like Bluetooth) will decrease the number of accidents caused by phones, and studies show texting reduces a persons reaction time.

One simulation showed talking on a cell phone is much more dangerous than talking to a passenger,the study concluded this because a passenger can take an active role in making the driver attentive of traffic and of course facilitate with directions. Recently, in Columbus, Ohio, a news report reported that the State Highway Patrol logged fifty more fatalities than in the same period for the prior year. The Highway Patrol noted that nineteen fatalities were the result of distracted driving.

Family's going on vacations, and many other people that share the roads. Everyone just wants to get to their location safely, but sadly, this always doesn't happen. Each year thousands of Americans are killed due to distracted driving, even more are injured. It's a dangerous problem that is getting larger by the day.

"Imagine the world in the future, completely full and covered with cars. Roads are going to start taking up every area of Earth, if people continue driving everywhere and buying cars. I think people should limit car usage because it's environmental friendly, they'll get more exercise, and people will be happier. Cars can be handy from time to time, but i think they should only be used occasionally. Imagine if there was a car for everyone on the planet. Car usage should decrease.

First of all, the Earth is beautiful and the people on it need to take better care of it. For example, just one day without the use of cars in a city, allowed them to construct bike paths, new sidewalks, and reduced traffic jams. Fuel from cars will polute the air and cause smog. If everyone continues to use cars as much as they do or more, there will be no way to clean all the air. When Paris banned cars for a while, smog was cleared and reduced by a lot. Limiting car use will not save the Earth completely, but it will help very much.

Secondly, if people started using cars less, they could get outside more and get more exercise. Biking will help people get fresh air and decrease pollution because cars won't be used as much. People should start finding jobs or doing activities that are close enough to walk or bike to. Cars are for situations in which you really have no other way there or long distances. That's all I think they should be used for. Everyone would be much more fit and healthy if it weren't for being lazy and having to take a car there.

Lastly, not using cars could increase people's happiness. Some people suggest that having a car makes them tense. Everyone would become much closer together and explore more of the world without cars. We could all be outdoors or around each other more. For example, you could take the bus to work instead of your car and meet a new friend. You never know what could happen when you try something new. It's good to change things up once in a while, like not taking your car every now and then and finding another way there.

In conclusion, the positives definetely outnumber the negatives of limiting car use. The main three reasons in my opinion is that it's environmental friendly, you'll get more exercise, and you'll most likely be much happier. Think about all the good outcomes that could come out of not driving your car and try it sometime.",0
"PROPER_NAME

January 21, 2015

Dear Senator,

Im PROPER_NAME, writing you to ask if you could change the Electoral Collage, I'm sure I'm beside hundres asking for the same. Instead of voting for our slate of electors, we perfer to vote for the president himself. I have reasons, I will be glad to sure them with you.

In my opinion, I believe the Electoral collage is not fair. The bigger states get alot more electoral vote, So it's obvious if the president wins all the bigger states their going to win. The way I see it, is that the little states don't matter, or they aren't as important, since they got little electoral votes. For example, If I was running for president my main goal would be to win all the bigger states first, like; California, Texas, Florida. With them three states I already have 122 electrol votes, Thats when I'll start focusing on getting my other 148 votes by winning the little states over.

My other reason why myself, and hundres would rather vote for the president himself be, because of the mistakes of voting for the wrong canidate. Remember in 1960, Hawwii sent two slates of electors to Condress? What will happen?If you think about it anything and everything could go wrong!

Lastly,Voting for the president himself would be easier, You along with others in your range would not have to worry about the electoral votes. Not only that it may also be less stressful, and crazier. Voters like my parents would not get confuse for voting the wrong elector, and giving her vote to the wrong canidate.

In conclusion, I honestly think not having the electroal votes would be best for our voters. I'm sure the candidates would enjoy us the voters making the mistake and voting for the wrong elector, since at the end of the day the Canidate is the one getting the vote, that wasn't meant for him. Instead of voting for our electors, why won't we vote straight to our president?

Sinceraly,

"Have you ever wondered what other people might be feeling? Well the aruthor in the store is introducing us to this new technology called The

I believe this could be a good use for in the future for students in school who deals with depression and anxiety and doesn't show it. Some students probably wont't like the idea of a computer telling how you're really feeling because like some they probably doesn't like to show any emotions but this technology could help a lot of students out dealing with their emotions.

We all need just a reminder to smile every once and a while just like in the article it also says helps the muscles and helps preduce them.

"The reason why the school board shouldn't add hours to school because students already go to school to much and they would like more time off of school so they can do their homework, hangout with their friends, play sports out of school, and get more time to do their chores around the house.

The school board shouldn't add more hours because if students have appointments then they will have to put a later time but if the place of their appointment closes a little early then the students will have to leave school and that will make them have missing work, late work, more work to do at home with little amount of time, and more stress for the students to finish the work on time.

If the school board adds hours it will become a disaster for the students that have a job and need to get there in time also if they live far from their job their boss could get mad at them for being late and if they dont belive their worker they could get fired and then the student won't have a job, they won't get paid, and they won't have money to pay for what they need.

This is why the school board shouldn't add hours to school. ",0
"America's government was inspired by the Athenian republic, therefore giving the United States their way of governing today. In a republic government, it is said that the people of the country hold the power of electing their leaders to make decisions for their nation. In the United States of America, the presidential election is held every four years. The eligible citizens in every fifty states are granted the right to vote for their desired president. The process of which these votes are counted is called the Electoral College. The way in which a president is selected should be altered to the most popular vote because it produces a more accurate vote of the people and it provides the opportunity to directly select an individual's desired candidate.

Initially, the process of which the president of the United States is elected should be changed from the Electoral College to the most popular vote because it will produce a more accurate percentage of votes. In the article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong,"" Bradford Plumer states, ""And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election In 1976, a tie would have occurred is a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way."" Being that there is a lesser number of votes counted in an election due to the Electoral College, there is a highly greater chance of the outcome resulting in a tie rather than showing a clear winner. If the election was based off of the most popular vote, there would be a higher number of votes for each candidate, therefore reducing the chances of ending in a tie. Secondly, in the article, ""What is the Electoral College?"" the Office of the Federal Register wrote, ""The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral vote is required to elect the President."" This statement shows that the Electoral College requires more than just the majority of citizen's opinions. If at least half of the population votes one way, there should be no question about who is the winner. The most popular vote system would award the candidate that was favored by at least half of the population, therefore providing a clear and fair election. Clearly, the most popular vote system would significantly benefit the American Society.

additionally, the process in which the President is elected should be changed to the most popular vote because it will provide the opportunity to directly select and individual's desired candidate. In the article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why event the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong,"" Bradford Plumer quotes, ""Under the electoral college sytem, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" This is not how a republic is supposed to run. People are supposed to be granted the opportunity to elect the president of their choice, not of somebody elses. The most popular vote would take into consideration of every citizen's opinion with a direct percentage of votes to elect a certain candidate. In the article, ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,"" Richard A. Posner states, ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. No region South, Northeast, etc. has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" This may be true but if the most popular vote system was put into place, there would be an even more exact number of how many people voted for each candidate. The Electoral College does not voice the opinions of all citizens because in reality, a person is not directly voting for their desired candidate. They are voting for other representatives that will hopefully, in turn, elect the candidate they want. Obviously, the Electoral College is definitely a system that should be abolished in the United States of America.

In summation, the way in which a president is selected should be altered to the most popular vote because it produces a more accurate vote of the people and it provides the opportunity to directly select an individual's desired candidate. The Electoral College does not provide a fair result nor a clear winner. The most popular vote system would significantly change that for the better of the country.",0
"Emotions can reveal a lot about what is going through someone's mind. When a person is wearing a neutral face on, it is hard to tell what emotion they are feeling. Now there is technology to help decipher what that perosn is feeling. Dr. Paul Eckman has created a process when a computer contructs a 3-D computer model of the face to tell what emotion is on it, Facial Action Coding System or FACS.

In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'alto, the use of Facial Action Coding Sytem (FACS) to read the emotional expressions of students is valuable education wise and emotionally.

Knowing a student does not understand or is uninterested in a topic can help teachers in a tremendous way. If there is

""a classroom computer that could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson"" (D'alto). By modifying the lesson, the teacher will make a change to the lesson. After changing the lesson to an easier way for some students to understand, it can help the students grades. When a student is bored of the topic, the teacher can fix the lesson to be more interesting.

Not only will education be better for students, but emtionally they will feel a lot better. Dr. Eckman designs his system with the basic emotions: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness (D'alto). In classrooms, students may show emotions other than being bored or confused, but show something is wrong with them. Teachers can be notified that a student may seem troubled and can assist emotional support. Humans can tell when their friends are feeling by just giving a glance, but some may have trouble telling what emotion the other person is feeling (D'alto). With a new computer software that stores similar anatomical information as electronic code, created by Dr. Huang, a classroom computer is able to tell what emotion a student is feeling (D'alto). Teachers may not be close with some students, so they are unable to tell what the stduent is feeling. However, the computer can signal that a student is feeling a certain way to the teacher.

Students can excel education wise and emotionally due to the use of technology to read their emotional expressions in ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"".

Currently, students are becoming to feel sad or unwated, and tradies will unleash in school. With technology one step ahead, it is able to stop students from feeling unsafe, sad, or confused.",0
"In my opinion I believe that the use of this technology is great because in the text it was stated that ""a classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" and since mosts students dont like to speak up maybe the teacher can ask them after class if they understood the subject or the lesson that day.

But everything has an opposing side. This could also not be a benefit because maybe if someone has a private feeling saying maybe like a crush and the computer states something like ""in love"" maybe thats something they wanted to keep for themselves. well mainly that would depend on the teacher you have or if she/he will tell anyone but id doubt it.

Some feelings are also really difficult to understand like maybe the computer can bring the wrong emotion or mis calculate how you are feeling. "" the facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" according to Dr. huang.",0
"""The Electoral College is a process, not a place"". It was established as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote elected by the citizens. But people such as Bradford plumer are staring to think even the ""bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"". While others believe we should keep our ""despised method of choosing the President"" said Richard A. Posner. but in all reality the Congress should keep the Electoral College as a way of electing the presidents and its candidates, even though it could use some updating.

The Electoral College should be kept as the way of voting for the President and fishers candidates. ""Despite the lack of democratic pedigree, its all pratical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons."" says Posner. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible, but its not likely than a dispute over the popular vote. Basically its a certainty of an outcome, Now understanding the fact that the electoral college voters vote not for the president, but for the state of electors, and over 60 percent of the voters would prefer a direct election. Only because the people believe the electoral college is unfair, outdated and irrational to the voters. People can see what the ones against the electoral college are upset about, its true, it is the electors who elect the president, not the citizens who vote. But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominees, and that trust hardley ever betrayed.

Ones against have said ""the large states get more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign rather than a small state"". They also have said ""the winner of the take it all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all, including South Carolina and Rhode Island.. they didnt even get a single ad"". But the electoral college restores some of the weight in the political balance that the large states lose in population.

Plumer strongly believes to abolish the electoral college. This year he already expects a close election in which the popular vote winner could lose the the presidency yet again, but the electoral college still has its defenders.. In his argument he would call the electoral college a ""disaster factor"". The only disater factor on the electoral college is that its not a modern sense.. When you vote for a presidential candidate your actually voting for a slate of electors. The Electoral College needs to be updated in the method of selecting a president.

In a nutshell, the Electoral College should be the way to vote for the president and the candidates. It could be argued that the elctoral college is unfair and not updated, which is true, the electoral college needs to be updated. But the electoral college was made by founding fathers as a compromise, and it should stay that way.",0
"Cars have been used for as long as we can remeber. They have made traveling a whole lot easier. You may be surprised about how many citizens are no longer using a car to get to places. Three advantages of limiting car usage are less pollution,more time and healty life,and it improves safety.

To begin with cars have givin us both advantages like faster traveling time but they have also given us disadvantages. Most of us can agree that cars have caused some of the pollution that we have now. The cold nights and warm days have caused th car emissions to be traped in our atomsphere. In Paris,one of the biggest capital has a big amount of cars that nearly had a new record of pollution. Acording to

Elisabeth Rosenthal, from the new york times ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe.""

Research has also found out that Paris have more smog then any other European capitals. After not using their cars the smog quickly reduce. In the capital of France congestion was 60 percent down after five-days of being unable to use their cars.

Another thing that is also giving us a more healty live and more time.

""Rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic"" according to Andrew Selsky, from the seattle times.

A businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza said ""

It's a Good opportuinty to take away stress and low air pollution.""

Parks and sports centers are now starting to get bigger and appear more through the city. More people have also started using the sidewalks or get on a bicycle. Malls are now closer, leaving you able to walk to it. You can now hear the swishs of bicycles and children talking instead of the sounds of cars.

Last of all,it improves safety of many people. Since there are less cars on the street there are less chances of car crashes. Parents can know be less worried about their child being run over. Car crashes caused by drunk drivers are also less liklely to happen. People now take public transportations or car-pool with friends making it more safer.

In conclusion, car have been around for a long time. They have givin us advantages and disadvantages. There are many advantages towards limiting car usage. Three of these reasons are less pollution,more time and healty life,and it improves safety.",0
"Car use all over the world has tried to be reduced throughout the years in attempt to save the environment by using fewer green house emissions, air pollution, and smog. Participating in these measures can help. If all countries would participate, this could make a huge revolution for the world and the environment.

In Vauban, Germany the roads are almost completely car free. There are a few exceptions, but they come with a cost. Exceptions according to Rosenthal's source 1, paragraph 2 include, ""Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park large garages at the edge of the development, where a carowner buys a space, for 40,000, along with a home."" This action allows people to purchase a vehicle, but reduces the amount of people buying them because of the exorbitant additional cost for a parking garage and having to buy a house in that area too. As stated in paragraph 3, of source 1, it has resulted in ""70% of vaughn's families do not own cars and 57% percent sold a car to move here."" Also sated in paragraph 3, source 1, the people who had cars in the past were always stressed, but now without cars their stress levels have gone down, and they are much happier. Positively, in response to the people eliminating most of the car use, Vaunban has built stores and malls that are in walking distance of the people, paragraph 6, source 1.

In Paris, smog levels have been at their alltime high. In response to these problems, Paris has come up with a system that still allows driving, but reduces the amount of drivers. Their system, according to paragraph 2, of source 2, is ""On Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31. The same would apply to oddnumbered plates the following day."" This would not only reduce smog, but also traffic jams, rush hours, and congestion by 60% says source 2, paragraph 5. This leaves Paris with a winwin. Less traffic leading to less stress, and less smog resulting in a healthier city.

Bogota, Columbia participated in a car free day too. As a result, like many others, it reduced pollution and stress. It caused a happier, healthier environment. People who didn't participate were fined 25. If you offer a punishment, it will allow people to participate because they don't want to be fined.

Also, offering other forms of transportation such as a bus, bycicles, or skating propel people to do it because they know there will be other forms of ways to get to where they need to go. Negatively, people need to be at a certain place, on a certain time, resulting in their rebellion to take place in the activities held in the city.

Positively, the large amount of participation has resulted in the growth of parks, sportcenters, malls, and reconstruction of sidewalks to promote fewer car uses, says source 3, paragraph 9.

Elisabeth Rosenthal really touches on the reduction of greenhouse gas emmision because it is better for the environment and for the health of the people worldwide. If technology continues to advance, like it has in the past years, people can continue to communicate over the phone and use car pulling to reduce the amount of cars driven daily.

Sharing cars or reducing the amount we get to use them, will also supplement safety for people by reducing car crashes which could save many lives.",0
"Limit car usage! While you may think having a car is a necessity, others completely disagree. According to the passage -''In

German, life goes on without cars'', street parking, driveways, and home garages are forbidden in a new district on the outskirts of

Frieburg. 70% Vauban families dont own cars and 57% sold there cars just to move. Many find it better this way. For example,Heidren Walter stated- '' When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.''

In Paris, France, there is more smog then any other European capital. According to the passage- ''Paris bans driving due to smog'', drivers were fined and motorists with even numbered license plates were forced to leave there cars at home. Diesal fuel is to blame for warmer layers of air traping car emissians. Delivery companies complained. However, exceptions were made for plug-in car, hybrids, and cars that can hold three or more people. When the smog cleared,the ruling French party rescinded the ban for odd numbered plates. According to the passage-''car- free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota''- this is the third year cars have been banned, this sets a goal to promote alternative transportation and to decrease smog. This program influenced two other

Colombian cities to join and participate in trying to end all smog. The reduce of cars impacted Colombia in a positive way.

Therefore, causing the air to blossom and the air to blossom and new construction to occur. In the U.S.A, President Obama's goal is to curb the U.S green house gas emissions. According to the passage-'' The end of car culture'', the U.S has peaked its driving miles in 2005 and dropped there after. A recent study found that driving by young people decreased 23% between 2001 and 2009. However the Mobile congress in Barcelona, Spain, laid out a business plan inwhich bicycles, private cars, and public transportation traffic would save time, conserve resources and save energy.

Concluding to all my information, many countries and states are still trying to reduce car usage. Therefore, reducing smog and pollution . This will not only improve the air , it also solves our time, resource, and safety issues. This will help to improve society aswell. Therefore, we can live without cars.",0
"Distracted Driving:

""The use of cell phones while operating a motor vehicle""

From teenagers to senior citizens, the majority of people own a cell phone. People are constantly on the go and life can be busy. Technology has produced many opportunities for people to stay in contact and take care of business all at the same time. Social media occupies people for many hours of the day. The cell phone has become an obsession in everyday life. As demanding as society and life in general is, and people constantly on the go, the use of cell phones while driving can cause accidents and even be fatal.

There are many people each day who rely on cell phones and communication each day for their jobs. Occupations such as lawn service, heating and air conditioning, electricians, and technical repairmen all depend on communication while driving an automobile. Getting in touch with people while being on the go is an unfortunate hazard in many occupations. While there are still ways to communicate and not be driving, people still live a hectic lifestyle. Although work and driving may be part of daily routine, social media is not.

Social media has stormed the world in the past decade. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and many other social media campaigns have occupied people all ages. Access of social media through cellular devices is common among people of all ages. Everyone wants to know what is going on with their friends and family all the time. Even while they are operating a motor vehicle. This can be the epitome of distracted driving.

Distracted driving kills and injures many people every day. Operating a cellular device can cause you to have to take your eyes of the road. When you take your eyes off the road you lose sense of control and can possibly drift into oncoming traffic. When you use cellular devices you have to take your hands off of the steering wheel. This can cause you to lose control and possibly leave the roadway altogether. Operating a cellular device above all makes you take your mind off of what you are doing, driving a car.

The use of cell phones while operating a motor vehicle is not the most intelligent thing a person can do. Anytime you are distracted you can be in an accident. If you enter into oncoming traffic you can be killed or kill another person. There are thousands of accidents every day involving the operation of cell phones while driving. Although many occupations require the use of cellular devices, there are laws restricting the use while the vehicle is in operation.",0
"Dear Senator,

I agree with Bob Dole about abolishing the Electoral College. The Electoral College is unfair to the voters. It's called the diaster factor for a reason. The American people should be able to vote for who they want. It states that when a person votes you are clearly voting for a slate of electors not the president himself. The Winner-take-all system in each state, candidiates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning,focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.

The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. It is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. Residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised- to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president.

Should residents of another region feel like their votes do not count? No, they shouldn't each vote should be counted in order for the president to get into The White House. The president is their president as well as mine and yours and they shouldn't have to feel as if he wasn't and wouldn't want to know what their interest were. They should be treated equally.

In the big states the Electoral College it restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. Other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campain than a small one does.. Every state should have the same amount of attention, not be treated differently.",0
"Im going to tell you if the facial action coding system is a good or bad idea. First the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an action unit. Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). Eckman has classified six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles.

The facial expressions for each emotion are universal, observes Dr. Huang, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression (like not smiling as broadly). Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vincis masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion).

In fact, we humans perform this same impressive calculation every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc.

Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code.

The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do. Imagine a computer that knows when youre happy or sad. For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, notes Dr. Huang. So computers need to understand that, too.

In conclusion the technology to read peoples facial expressions is a great idea because the computer could help students out if they dont understand the work just by reading there faces.",0
"I think that the Face they saw in 1976 was just a natural landform. I will be giving you at least 4 reasons why that's my conclusion. After you have listened to my reasons hopefully you will then think the same.

My first reason why I think it was just a natural landform is becasue first of all I am a scientist and I'm not suppose to think aliens and that kind of stuff exist. Secondly, on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor took a picture of Cydonia for the first time all they saw was just a natural landform. One of my other reasons why is becasue we thought it was just a Martian mesa, witch are very common in Cydonia. My last reason is becasue with the 3D high-resolution images from NASA's MGS it shows that it was just a mesa.

Those were all my reasons why I think it was a natural landform not an alien. Hopefully now you agree with me and think it was just a natural landform too. Also I hope that you have come to your senses and now think that aliens are not real.",0
"How can we stop pollution from destroying the Earth and everything that  lives inside of it. If we take a look around us we try to save the Earth by recycling things that reusable. Well its not enough, we have to reduce one of the major cause that is making the greenhouse gas increased. Cars are use in our everyday life, to work, to school,and to buy groceries. We use cars for everything and the toxic gases release by cars are killing the Earth. This toxic gases are being release into the air we breath in. This gases are affecting us and the environment the animals live in, but is also affecting the Earth.

We depend on the Earth everyday, when we wake up we expect the sun to shine on our face and the plants expect the light from the sun to observe carbon dioxide and release oxygen, our major source of surviving. 12 percent  of greenhouse gas is due to passenger in Europe, but in the United States  it takes up to 50 percent in cars intensive. For example in Paris, they enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city from pollution. Almost 4000 drivers were charge for driving their own vehicle instead of any type of transportation on that day. If we really want to change the world and really help our planet we should follow the example of Bogota, Colombia, they set up a program that lead to a car free day, many Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work the result for this was that the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

Saving our planet is not difficult all you got to do is reduce pollution by recycling reusable things, use less energy in you home and use less water. Finally reduce using your own transportation use other things that will make you appreciate Earth for everything she has done for us. We can reduce pollution and greenhouse gas if we set our mind to do it.",0
"Growing up in the more modern times I see many things that would seem almost impossible to someone not born in this time. Cars are becoming more advanced than ever. Although they have their advantages, the use of cars also has many disadvantages. They polute the air and they can be very dangerous. The pros of cars are by far outweighed by the cons, if you look at them in the long run. Limiting car use could preserve the earth, relieve stress, and reduce the amount of overweight people in America.

Although cars make everyday life easier, lessening the use of them could potentially ""save the world."" pollution is at an all time high and car emissions are largely to blame. In paragraph five it states that, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Euope... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States."" This is saying that the emissions from cars are destroying the earth. Though going to the grocery store that is two miles away may seem easier by just hoping in the car and arriving in less than five minutes, walking or biking would be better for you and the environment. Many cities are even focusing on becoming more ""pedestrian friendly"" to help boost the enthusiasm of cutting the use of cars. Walking is not the only option either, using hybrid cars, carpooling, or public transportation is also an option. Though still involving the use of cars, emissions would be reduced greatly. Also, emissions can cause sickness. In large cities where cars are depended on there is Smog. Smog is a thick black cloud of pollution that hangs in the air over large cities. Smog can make you very sick if you injest it. Many people in cities that do have smog have to wear face masks when walking outside. I do not think that face masks are a new trend that everyone would like to start wearing. Lessening the use of cars around us would be a healthy step towards restoring our environment and could start a trend for others to do so swell.

Another advantage of cutting the use of cars would be less accidents. Thousands of car related accidents happen every minute around the world in automobiles. If everyone started walking, biking, or using pubilc transportation less cars would be on the road leading to less accidents. Families lose loved ones everyday just because the driver of the car isnt paying attention. Drivers have many extra responsibilities when operating the vehicle. They have to watch everything around them, including being responsible for everyone else in the car. Many people have reported being ""less stressed"" after they lowered the use of cars. Heidrun Walter said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" when talking about moving to a car free community. Thousands are converting to the trend of using the car less and others are cutting the use completely! Following this trend would be a large benefit to yourself and the enviornment around you.

Lastly, America is known for being obese and cars support this idea. Cars make it easy for someone to get places without putting any physical work into it. Cars encourage people to be lazy. Lowering the use of cars and walking more would help reduce the percent of people that are overweight in our country. Instead of wanting to get in the car and drive to do something they could walk and get some excercise or even take a bike if they wanted to get there faster. Walking and biking are low intensity excercises making it easy for everyone to participate. Many overweight people always feel lathargic, getting out and walking or biking would also help them to feel better. Doing this would help our people and environtment become more heatlhy.

Cars are a great invention but it is not necessary for every individual to have one. Walking and biking are better alternatives. The use of cars has gone through the roof creating problems around the world. A healthy environment for our children and grandchildren is what we imagine. One does not think of using a car as damaging to the enviornment until after they have done it. Limiting car usage would turn the world into a healthier, stress reduced place. For these reasons I think it would be of best interest to try and find other alternatives to driving as much.",0
"Dear senator, Imagine it being the year for choosing for a new president for the United States of America. You cast your vote, for which president you thought that would be best to run our country. After, you hear the results you become very disappointed , Because the president won not by the popular vote but by the electoral college. You become very angry and frustrated because the president that will now be running for America will not better our country by the things he said. Reasoning, that he won by the electoral college and not by popular vote, and you feel as if you dont feel as if it was not fair because you're not really choosing based on the state laws and how the electors are selected. How would you feel if you were in a situation like this ?

Furthermore, i think we should change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States of America. My reasoning being said is because when the president wins by popular vote it's from what the american citizens want, not what the electors chose. When you choose by popular vote you also avoid many other things from occurring. For example, the electoral college is a method of selecting the president that may turn off voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying for their state. As explained in the text "" voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election."" Moreover, the electoral college is unfair to voters. candidates dont spend as time in states they know they have no chance of winning, and only focusing on the states that they do. As said in the text "" In a 2000 campaign , seventeen states dont see the candidates at all, including in rhode island and south carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a single campaign ad. Making that hard for the people to see what there president wants to do for the country they have no idea because of the candidate too worried on winning and letting the citizens choose.

To elaborat on my claim, the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The disaster factor is what happened in the 2000 fiasco which was the biggest election crisis in a century , which allows the system for much worse. In the electoral college state legislatures are responsible for picking electors, and those electors would effect the will of the citizens. sometimes ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever thet please."" Making another reason why the electoral college should'nt be here to stay.

Although, keeping the electoral college may not be a good thing to do.",0
"Texting and Driving

In these times, cell phones and the internet have been ingrained into every aspect of our lives. One particularly dangerous aspect is the operation of a motorized vehicle. Use of a telephone to any extent while driving has been prohibited in Georgia. Rightfully so, considering the overwhelming number of car accidents caused by a person using a cell phone behind the wheel. Drivers should not be allowed to use a cell phone while operating a motorized vehicle.

No human is able to multitask and do each task to the best of their ability. So why should people be allowed to do two tasks that require a vast amount of focus to complete at the same time? It is a recipe for disaster and the proof is everything from television commercials to cold, hard statistics. According to The National Safety Council, use of a cell phone while driving caused 1.6 million car crashes each year. That means 1 in 4 car accidents were caused by texting and driving.

Georgia has implemented a new law called The Hands Free law, stating that it is illegal to have your cell phone in your hand while driving. This has seen a tremendous decline in car accidents since the passing of this law. This only further proves that texting and driving is deadly and leads to immense amounts of casualties.

Texting and driving should continue to be outlawed, and the hands free law should be implemented all over the country. It saves lives and decreases the amount of annual car crashes. No one should have a phone in their hand when in the driver's seat of a moving vehicle. It endangers their life, as well as the lives of everyone else on the road. Texting and driving is bad.",0
"Phones & Driving

Should you be using your phone while driving a vehicle?

I'll tell you reasons why you shouldn't use your phone while driving. Then, I'll explain to you what can happen to you if you use your phone while driving a vehicle. Afterward, I'll tell you the kinds of consequence you can receive from the situation. Finally, I'll give you examples of why it's a bad idea of using your phone while driving.

Should you be using your cellular device while driving a vehicle? In my opinion you shouldn't use your phone while driving. You shouldn't use it because you can get distracted easily. Never know what can happen you might pass a red light and cause an accident. Phones shouldn't be use for texting nor calling but you can use it to get somewhere. In case you don't know where it is you can use your gps but that's it.

Reasons why you shouldn't use your cellphone. To begin with it's against the law to text and drive. Secondly, you can cause an accident you never know what can happen when you don't pay attention. You might pass a light or someone might be crossing the street and you won't be able to see that person. You're putting others people life in danger.

In this paragraph I'll tell you about the type of consequence you can get. It is illegal to use your phone while driving. You can receive a monetary fine which can range from $20 up to $500 depending on the state. Also can be charge as a criminal charge. In some states using your phone or texting while driving can be a result in criminal misdemeanor charges. Lastly, you can be in jail or prison time if your injury another driver or another human.

Example why you shouldn't use your phone. First thing first you can cause an accident. You put your life in danger and other people's life in danger. You assume that you will have it under control but you never know what can happen any second. Also you might hit another car or pass a red light. These are reasons why not to use your phone. You can take an innocent person life and if you survive you will have pain inside you.

Finally, I believe you shouldn't use your phone is for the best. If you don't you don't have any risk on putting people life in danger. Everyone would be safe and no accidents would occur. Phones shouldn't even belong on your hand while driving. Unless you need it to get somewhere.",0
"Venus can be a scary planet when it comes down to its features. The writer to this story certanly convinced me that we should not study Venus anymore. We have tried to land spacecraft on the planet before, but none have last no more than a few hours, so how are we supposed to study it when it just keeps destroying our spacecrafts. We haven't tried it again in a decade. The reason to this is that Temperatures vary around 800 degrees fahrenheit. Venus has a thick atmosphere of 97% carbon dioxide. If us humans even take a step on Venus we get crushed. Venus has a 90% atomic pressure, which is greater than what we have on Earth. It could even crush a submarine and those are supposed to outstand pressure from the ocean. Venus isn't a very pretty planet either, it has a familiar features as valleys,mountains, and craters. We could use spacecraft to hover over venus about 30 miles or so above it. Even if we did that we couldn't take sample rocks or gas. Are technology gets better throughout the years, so maybe one day well figure a way out to oustand that heat and pressure. Even if we do that though, what would be the sense if we cant even live on the planet. Half of the stuff we use today will never outstand the heat or pressure that Venus has. Including phones,cars,and houses. This shows you that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.",0
"In this artical is cool how this technology can read peoples faces as in emotions. If this can really happen then its going to jsut how people learn in school. in a way were it mite be fun to go to school.

I am for this technology because it can help students learn more about school. The face emotion technology is mind blowing if it works. If you think about it the computer can tell when your happy or sad which is awesome.

So when your working on a subject on your computer and the computer sees that your sad its going to make it were your happy. If your happy then its going to make you stay happy.

It goes in to the it will be a 3-D computer modle to track your face. If that happens then they would have to get everyones face in the United States and everywhere else around the world. To me i think its cool.

To me I think its a really good thing to try and see if it works. If it can tell if your happy then i say lets go for it and make everyone happy and get the world into a positive world. Students need it the most because there are so may negative students in schools and they need to start being happy for themselfs and for others in there garde and there fellow students. So I'm all for it to have this 3-D face modle thing to make you happy.",0
"In the United States, people are very busy. With school, work, and extracurricular activities in the mix of ""everything else,"" Americans rely on an efficient and preferably fast mode of transportation, and typically, their first resort is car. However, while cars are extremely convenient, they are also very dangerous to the environment. Car usage should be limited because there are many advantages, including less smog, less traffic, healthier people, and reduced air pollution.

To start off, when car usage is limited, smog and air pollution are drastically limited too. According to the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in the United States. This is a major problem in many different parts of the world, yet people still continue to always resort to cars, though they have many other options. Transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind powerplants, and the pollution that comes from it is most detrimental to the environment and ourselves. If we limit car usage, we will drastically reduce air pollution.

Furthermore, when car use is limited, it is better for humans. When people do not drive cars, they will sometimes walk, skate, or bike to where they need to be. This is exercise, so it is better for you than just sitting in a car. When people use other methods of transportation like walking, biking, or skating, they do not have to worry about being stuck in traffic for hours. Limiting car usage also saves money. When you do not drive as much, you do not have to pay as much for gas, or paying for parking. These are huge advantages.

In conclusion, there are many different benefits and reasons that we should limit car usage. We can walk, bike, skate, or even take a bus or carpool with other people. It will reduce air pollution, make people healthier, save money, and people can feel good knowing they are doing something good for the environment and themselves.",0
"This strange figure that took the shape of a face on Mars is actually just a natural landform. It looks much like a landform equivalent to a butte or mesa which are common in the American west. shadows around give the illusion to the eyes that this strange figure has eyes, a mouth, and a nose.

Proof has been found from high tech cameras that shows that this is just a landform and was not created by aliens. After we found the what seemed to be alien markings we decided to look again. Its has the same height as some natural landforms like the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. If they was anything that could have left a mark by aliens we would've been able to see it.

You can dipect the size of something in a photo 3 time larger in real life. So if there was anything on Mars that shows aliens were there than we would definately be able to see it, but there is none so that leads us to the conclusion that this odd looking figure is just a natural landform and not built by anybody.

To conclude my arguement on whether or not this strange looking figure is actually made by extraterrestrials or just there by nature I belive this is just a natural landform. There is proof and that it was not made by aliens and none that shows aliens made this figure. We used our best equipment to find an answer by research and strongly belive in our answer. There are no markings of aliens of any sort on Mars that could have built this figure. There is an illusion that this shape is in the shape of a face, but isnt really. The main point of this investigation was just to find out what on earth is this thing and where did it come from.",0
"Do you know the advantages and the disadvantages of having of not having a car? Yes, actually not having a car. Most people would freak out of the thought of not having a car some are just use to it. But could it actually save more money or would it cost more?

Vauban, Germany people have actually given up their cars, they call it ""car-free."" Not everyone has given up their cars. ""The main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park- large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home""- Source 1 by:Elizabeth Rosenthal. The Vauban's started  getting involved and getting informed on not using a car. Soon 70 percent of Vauban's familiy does not own a car, and 57 percent sold a car to move to Germany. Some even liked the idea of not using a car ""When I had a care I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" says Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two. She nows walks verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor. in 2006 Vauban completed, this is an example of growign trend in Europe, the united States and elsewhere to seperate suburban life from auto use, this is a movement of ""smart planning."" The advantage is you will have more access to public transportation, a disadvantage is if you live far from public places then you might have to walk or take a bus.

In Paris they have enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday motorists with even- numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine($31). Nearly 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters. Twenty seven people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesels engines int he rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters. The advantage of not having a car is that you wouldn't be spending money on gas, the disadvanteage is that you will be fined. Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made fro plug-in cars, hybirds, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday. After the smog ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday. There is alot of disadvantages because would you have a work day on Tuesday and you have an odd numbered plate. Also soem people are not familar with the public transportation and some people may not think it's the best way to get around in town. You also have to get up eary to catch the bus, train, etc.

BOGOTA,Colombia- In a program that sets to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or tooked buses to work during a car-ffree day yesterda, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. This was their third staright year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal was to promote alternative  transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines. In Bogota there were occasional rain showers . Some thought it was a good idea some not so much. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress in lower air pollution,"" said a businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife. Many countries have tried having a car-free day, and many succeeded. For the Unoted States President Obama ambitious goal was to curb the U.S greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortutious assit from incipient shift in American behavior. The studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. In 2005 the United Stes peaked and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company.  As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995.

So driving with a car or not it either good or bad because not driving could give you the excerise and driving just means you like your personal things. I think that when  the government says it's a fine then follow the rules. Either way not having a car does has it advantages every country should have a car-free day.",0
"A classroom is possibly one of the most diverse places we can have in today's world. There are students with different ethnic backgrounds, different spoken languages, and different emotions. Regardless, all students gather to learn new material used to help them in the real world. However, certain material presents hardship with some students and ease with other. Being able to understand exactly how a student feels can make their learning significantly easier. Though some problems may occur, it can be invaluable to a student. The FACS technology can be utilized in the classroom in may ways with few downfalls.

In the world like the one today, reliability and consistently are key. People today enjoy things that are useful and fun. The children of this generation especially want that. Before the children can age and make something with their lives, someone along the road has to teach them. Education is something that starts young and is so important and valued so heavily that without it you are looked at as irrelevant. States hire teachers and put trust in them that they are able to teach the children and provide a good base to go out and experience the real world. Teachers have so much weight bearing down on them. A teaching job is argueably one of the most mentally exhausting and frustrating. Some students do not care about grades while some graduate with a 3.8gpa. Imagine how different this world could be if everyone was able to graduate with a high gpa and go to college and proceed to make their lives meaningful. Thomas Huang, of Beckman Institue for Advanced Science at the University of Illonois was one such person. Along side Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam, Huang may have created one technology that can be the change. These scientists create the FACS, or Facial Action Coding System. The computer is used to read human facial motion and determine emotions. Prof. Huang even has gone on record to say that it can be beneficial in a classroom. This statement is true beyond a doubt. Students emotion's change from minute to minute. There are unlimited benfits with only a few cons. The main con is that the machine may take time to read a face and by the time it has been read, the emotion can change. Also, this technology can be expensive, especially for a school with hundreds or even thousands of students. Despite that, the machine can understand students that day. With a better understanding for the student, the lesson can be adjusted to make it more comprehensable. Since most classrooms are not this dynamic, every student moves on to doing the same thing at the same time. This technology can change up the questions so that an advanced student may move on faster than one who is struggling. Perhaps one of the most important things people need to be aware of in the education system is the student's emotion. Like stated previously, emotions change. So if the computers sees a student with health issues such as depression, it can aid the student in getting help. Parents, teachers, and other school administration need to be aware of the student more than the cost of things. Even with the cost the computer's benefits are easily overshadowing it.

Teachers and students rely on technology so often and for so many reasons. Whether it be school work or just for entertainment, there is no harm to add a feature that reads emotion. The price should be looked at as just a number, and human emotion and feeling should out rank that in importance. The FACS computer is someting that schools need to be looking into for the care of their students.",0

"The Face isn't an alien artifact. It wasn't created by aliens, it's just a natural landform on Mars. If it was created by aliens NASA would've already found out. There is no real evidence that aliens did it, only in Hollywood movies, and books. Though some people think otherwise.

Aliens arn't the reason the Face is on Mars. Nasa has went on three missions to Mars to take pictures. Each time they went there has been no trace of aliens. Also NASA upgraded their camaras each time they went to Mars. So the pictures were more clearer.

On the second mission NASA went on, the camaras proved it was a natural landform. Though other scientist belived alien markings were being hidden by wispy clouds. This is because it was winter in Mars during the time NASA went. Still NASA went on a third trip to make its point. This time they used their most advanced camera yet and took crystal clear pictures of the Face.

The pictures reaveled it was a Martian equivalent of a butte. This is a common landform around the American West. This couldn't be caused by aliens because Mars could've caused this landform to appear. Just like in the American West. Still people think that the alien markings are still there.

Overall aliens could'nt of caused this landform. There is no evidence of aliens being on Mars. There is only fiction stories about it, and on radio talk shows. NASA has went on three missions to prove it's a natural landform, and they were'nt able to find alien markings. If this isn't enough evidenve to convince someone they must be a big alien fan.",0
"When you seek for different opinions do you ask multiple people? A study shows that when people ask multiple people for different opinions for a certain thing they make a better choice then not asking anyone for their opinions. This happens because not everyone has the same opinion on a certain thing, the certain individual that they are asking has been through that same situation, and you get multiple opinions and you pick the one you think its right.

Its better to ask multiple people for their opinion because not everyone has the same opinion on a certain thing. For example, lets say that a student was asking her friends if she should take a job or not and more than half said yes and the other people said no so, shes probably going to go with the answer with the most votes. Also, there is billions of people in the world and they have similar but not exact opinions on a certain thing or situation. It is also better to ask for different opinions because every single person in the whole wide world as a different mindset and different ways they will solve their problems and they also have different knowledge over a certain thing.

Many people ask multiple people for their opinion because that certain individual that they are asking has been through that same situation. It is sometimes very common for someone to has had or has the same problem or been through that situation. For example, my friend ask me for my opinion for a certain situation and turns out I had been through that same situation or problem. There for, I helped her solve her problem and helped her make a better choice. Also, when you find a individual or person that has or has been helping you solve that situation, they sometimes can help you through life because you and them might have a similar mindset of solving a problem or situation.

Seeking for multiple opinions can help you make a better choice because you will get multiple opinions and you will pick the one you think its right. It is proven that when you have different options to pick from you will pick the one you like the best or the one you think it is right. For example, lets say that someone had the chance to pick anything from a box of expensive items, they will probably pick the one that is appealing to their eyes or the one that it is more visible to their eyes. There for, it is the same thing that happens when you ask multiple people for their advice for a certain thing because then you will pick the one you like the best.

In conclusion, people ask multiple people for their advice for a certain thing or situation because not everyone has the same opinion on a certain thing, the individual that they are asking has been through the same situation, and you will get multiple opinions and you will pick the one that you think its right.",0
"You are about to buy a brand new bike, and have a few styles and sizes in mind.

The information you have on the bikes is small, and not enough to make a good decision.

All of them seem so similar that you don't know which to choose.

You could just research them online, but you want other people to help you.

That is why you need to seek out other people and ask for their opinions.

Seeking multiple opinions can help you make a better choice because you can gather more information and be exposed to different perspectives.

Asking for other people's opinions can allow you to get more information.

Gathering more information on a topic is a key component in anything.

It can help you strengthen a decision, prove a point, or make more educated choices.

If you can't decide between a few options and don't know enough about one to choose it, seek out more opinions.

The information that others give you on one of them might be enough to tip the scales and for you to make a choice.

You could also ask people for information just to reassure what you already know.

If you were to ask multiple people about something, and they give you the same response, it is most likely an accurate piece of information.

Whether it is to secure your beliefs or help you make a decision, gaining extra information can help you make a better choice.

Gathering other people's opinions can also help you see things in a way you hadn't seen them before.

When people form an opinion, it is hard to see other options as good choices, even if their idea isn't the best.

Seeking out other people's opinions can help get someone out of the mindset that their option is the best, and expose them to options they might have never thought about.

This can give them better options to choose from that they might have looked right over if they hadn't sought out multiple opinions.

There have been many instances where I have gathered more opinions from people in my life.

One example that sticks out to me is the first big purchase of my life; a computer.

I really wanted a computer for both school and games, but didn't really know what to look for, so I started asking people.

I asked my friends what they thought I should get, and asked my parents too.

I had also asked employees at tech companies such as Best Buy.

By the end of this, I had got enough information to know that I wanted a desktop computer with quite a bit of memory.

After I found the computer online, I went back and asked the people I asked before if this was a good choice.

They all supported my decision, and I got my computer.

If I hadn't asked others for their opinions, there is a large chance I could have made a poor choice.

Being exposed to different perspectives and gaining more information are reasons that seeking multiple opinions can help you make a better choice.

You can become more knowledgeable about something, strengthening your thoughts or decisions.

You could also be introduced to other perspectives and get more ideas.

Seeking out multiple opinions isn't just something to do if you are conflicted, but something to do in your everyday life.

But don't just take it from me, go ask others about seeking multiple opinions too.",0
"I do like the idea that computers can read our emotions. because it can tell if we are getting bored in a lesson then it could change the lesson like it says in paragraph 6 . I think that would help alots of kids stay focoused and on tastc.

Also i feel like it would make alot of desions much easyer to make because it would know if u like something or not then gve you more options like that one. For examiple when your online shoping or looking for a video game to play.

Somehting eles i think this emotion reading computer can help is when your upset and your on youtube or even socal media it knows your upset so it put stuff on your time line that won't make you even more sad or puts stuff on your timeline that will make you feel better. And that is why i think a computer that can read emotions would be very helpful in veryus ways.",0
"Why does electoral college still have its defenders, Abolish thee electoral college!... Electoral College was a compromise between election of thee president by a vote in congress and election of thee president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. I am writing to thee state senator of florida to argue in favor of keeping thee Electoral College. I am certain theat we should keep thee electoral college because of theree simple reasons. The Electoral College is a way of certainty of outcome. Swing states, and to Aviod runoff elections.

To commence I say thee system of electoral college should stay because it has a certaint of outcome. A dispute over thee outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible. This has happened before in 2000. In 2012 election, for Obama he received 61.7 percent of thee electoral vote compared to 51.3 percent of thee popular votes cast for him and rodney, thee Republican nominee for president in 2012. electoral votes arenon a winnertakesall basis. A tie in thee nationwide electora vote is possible because thee total number of votes 538 is an even number.

To continue thee second reason why I theink the electoral votes should stay is because of sing states. The winnertakeall metheod of awarding electoral votes induces thee candidates. Voters in tossup states are more likely to pay close attention to thee campaign to really listen to thee competing candidates knowing theat theey are going to decide thee election. The most theoughtful voters should be thee ones to decide thee election.

Last but not least electoral voting should stay because to aviod runoff elections. The Electoral College also avoids thee problem of election in which no candidate receives a majority of thee votes cast. Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 are good examples, theey bothe only a had 43 percent plurality of thee popular votes. Some potential voters who have no hope have less in centime to pay attention to thee campaign thean theey would have if thee president were picked by popular votes.

To briefly wrap up I argue in favor for thee Electoral Votes to stay because of thee certainty of outcome, swing states, and lastly to aviod runoff elections. In some people's opinion's theey would disagree, but theey will not have enough facts to support why theey disagree, because honestly Electoral Votes is always thee way to go.",0
"Throughout the article it is made known that Venus is an oustanding yet harsh planet. However Venus is one of Earth's closest neighbors and the planet most like Earth. Scientist believe that at one point Venus could of maintained a form of life, and for some reason still have hope to visit. Astronomers to this day are fascinated by Venus and would soon love to find a way to make a landing on this very earth-like planet. However, why are astronomers so fascinated by this planet?

Venus has many features that are analogous to those on Earth. However Venus has an atmosphere almost ninty-seven percent of carbon dioxide, and on the surface temperatures average over eight hundred degrees. Venus isn't the closest planet to the sun but is still the hottest. Even though some conditions are different Venus still has many conditions similar to Earth.

Throughout the article it is clearly states the similarities and differences between Earth and Venus. In paragragh three the author shows just how a like these two planets can be. ""Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking land on its surface."" These conditions listed are very similar to those of the conditions on Earth. However Venus may be similar in some forms, the differences between the two planets has prevented Venus from being discovered.

Venus may only ever be discovered through a ship flying over thirty miles above the landscape of the planet due to how harsh the conditions are. ""At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Farenheit,"" this claim by the author comes to show that even from a distance the conditions of Venus can be felt. Coming any closer to the planet would put those on the journey in a very dangerous situation.

However despite the harsh conditions and nearly impossible ideas, atronomers still attempt on landing something on the floor of Venus. Venus is the closest thing to Earth, and astronomers want to believe that one day it did or one day this planet will hold life.",0
"I know for a fact that when I need advice for something I ask a couple members of my family so I get more advice. Have you ever needed advice? Well if you haven't good for you, but most people need advice. It is better to hear a couple different people so you get more information than what you would get from one side.

Have you ever had a tough decision to make? Wouldn't it be better to hear both sides of the story rather than just one? For example, you may be getting bias information if you only take advice from one person. It is better to get information from multiple people so you get a better understanding of what you are learning about.

It's just like teamwork, for example it takes more than one person to play a game of basketball or football. The more people work together the more education people will get. People who hear only one side of the story will have the same information but it is more likely to be bias since it is from only one side. For example I watched a movie the other day and it was about these kids who had to work together to get anything done, and if the didn't work together they got no work done.

Everyone needs assistance every now and then. Like when you fall and someone helps you up, they are assisting you. One time I was on a board at my house and I fell off and broke my leg, but my friend was there and he carried me to the house. He assisted me by helping me to the house.

In conclusion, everyone needs advice at some point in your life. You can get it from anyone including your parents, but the more people you talk to, the more information you will receive. You can always talk to people like you parents, teachers, or even the guidance councilors at your school. No matter who you ask it will be less likely to be bias as long as you ask multiple people.",0
"Dear Senator Im writing you this letter to let you know that I argue with you of keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as acompromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by popular vote of quilified citizens. Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation, one for each member in the House of Representatives plus  two for your Senators. The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state's electors when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state's Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election. At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states the know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on thje tight  races in the ""swing"" sates. During the 2000 camaign, seventeen states din't see the candidates at all, inckuding Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters inn 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. The electoral College requires a presindential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Rommey was in the South, has no incentive to campaing heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a succesful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised, to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president.",0
"Limiting car usuage will give us many benefits. A projects such as Vauban and BOGOTA were completed to  show us the multitude of advantages recieved from it.

Reducing car usuage would be excellent for our enviorment. Research shows us that ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenshouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States""(Rosenthal). Our world is very materialistic and sometimes we forget that to even have life, we must have the enviorment. ""Cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities""(Rosenthal). Therefore, limiting the amount of cars would allow us to have more efficent green houses, and more land area for plants.

Money is also a huge factor here. The government spends hundreds of thousands of dollars each year in the transportation department. By lowering the number of cars on the road, the less wear and tear is done to them. This would be beneficial in many departements because then we would have more money for the things we need but cannot afford in our area and or country. Infact, ""80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transportation""(Rosenthal).

Driving also causes stress. Traffic jams, new or confusing road signs, attitudes of passengers, are all distributions of stress, especially when you get lost! If the amount of driving we did by ourselves was cut back, we could also cut back stress. BOGOTA helps to prove this, and even says that violaters of no car day were ""fined $25(Selsky).

Lastly, if we do not put a stop to so much driving, our personal health may be in risk. According to souce 4, ""the car industry is the second largest in the world."" This means that the air is constantly being pulluted with exhuast. Which also means that what's in your lungs at this very moment, could be a lot more than just oxygen. It's very scary to think that the same chemicals it takes to run your car, might just be what's floating around in your body. This could lead to multiple health problems and future diseases. Therefore, this issue needs to be taken control of immediately.

In conclusion, reducing car usuage would be an amazing thing to do for oursleves and the people around us. We would save our air and bodies from being polluted, we would save money, and save time not stressing out. Who doesn't want these things? Limiting car usuage would be a fantastic idea.",0

"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Should these summer projects be teacher-desdigned or students-designed?

These summer projects should be student-designed for varies reasons such as, engagment, vaction, and lastly, confidence.

Students during the summer have many things to worry about like having a job, looking after siblings or even their mental health and the last thing on their mind is a techer-designed project. The projects given throughout the summer should be student-designed becuase it allows the student to be engaged. The student will be more engaged because it is a topic that they want to learn about and being engaged shows that the student is willing to learn and is very intrested in his or her own topic. Typically, when a teacher assigns a project to a student, the student isn't very pleased and with that being said, it could affect the amount of effort and the desire that the students puts into actually learning.

Secondly, these projects also need to be student-designed because of summer experiences. During the summer, alot of students grow. Vaction plays a big role in the students growth and development, as the students travel they pick up more and more knowledge, which expands their knowldege and could possibly change thier perception of things, making it easier for them to have better ideas and to do well on their summer projects.

Lastly, student-designed projects over break leads to confidence. Because the student has had the freedom of choosing what he or she wants to learn about, it just makes it easier for the students to showcase their work with pride. Pride meaning, showing that the student has learned and is more than comfortable to enlighten others. To have confidence about what you have put alot of time into and worked on is an important skill to develop because the student will surely use it some other time in their lifetime.

In conclusion, these summer projects should be student-designed because it will surely keep the student engaged in his or her own learning and add a little more excitement to the students vacation because the project is something they are eager to learn and work on. Lastly student-designed projects will help build the students confidence because they know what they are talking about.                                                    ",0
"When trying to solve a problem or figure something out you normally need help or ask for an answer. Somethings are difficult to find out on your own. To find things out it is best to ask multiple people before going through with your decision.

Seeking multiple opinions often helps people make better choices. When making a decision it is often hard to do on your own. When you ask for one opinion you might find the answer to what you will do. When you ask for more than one opinion then you will have multiple resource's to how you will do things. The reason people ask is because they are unsure but when they ask it might help them figure out what they are going do.

Why do people have a hard time figuring out what the best option is you might ask. The answer is because they are unsure. When people ask for help they might have a easier time figuring out the things that they will do. There are many times when people ask for help or ask for your response and you might not even realize you're doing it. Some examples may include; a family member asking if there food is good, a teacher asking if you need help, or somebody asking you to explain something to them.

When people ask for someones opinion it often means that they do not fully know if they are right in there response or decision. Thats why asking for multiple opinions can help you. When asking for multiple you normally get a variation of answers, if its a broad topic. Unless its a math problem or a one answer question you normally get more that one answer. Even then you can still get more than one answer.

Although sometimes people ask more than just a person. Some people ask Google or a website on a electronic device. This is good sometimes because there are normally multiple resource's linked to it. Even when you have multiple resource's linked you can still just get one opinion. When I wake up in the morning I normally ask Google what the whether is but I also ask my parents just to make sure. This definitely is very helpful and helps me make better decisions most of the time.

When you ask one person they often have answers, but they have different experiences than the next person you ask. Thats why its better to ask more than one person for their opinion. In the chance that you do only ask one person you may find yourself deciding on weather you should do or act on what the say. When you ask more than one person you get more options or the same response, which is sometimes good. That why you should always ask for a second opinion or even a third.

In conclusion asking for advice is better done when you ask multiple people, and it can often help you with what you decide to do.",0
"In the past, owning a car has been very beneficial and very efficient in order to go about our daily lives. In the past few years, however, people are buying less and less cars and taking the train or bike to get around. All this has been brought up by environmental conditions some countries have had to deal with recently. There are advantages to having a car, but there are more advantages without one.

Driving cars allow people to get from point A to point B in a matter of minutes, but this harms the environment drastically. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intesive areas in the United States"" (Rosenthal, paragraph 5, Source 1). These emissions can cause major damage not just to one location but the whole planet overall.""Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found"" (Duffer, Paragraph 17, Source 2). Smog has caused a problem in Paris recently, having more smog than other major Western European cities. ""Diesels make up 67 percentof vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Europe, according to Reuters"" (Duffer, paragraph 16, Source 2). Paris and other cities like it are faced with a huge environmental problem. Later on , however, Paris put a plan in to stop all of these emissions. On one day, motorists with even-numbered license plates had to leave their car at home or face a 31$ fine. The next day would be the odd-numbered plates. Congestion went down 60 percent, allowing the French ruling party to cancel the ban of odd-numbered plates on the next day.

With this decreased use of cars, many cities are reforming the suburbs, such as Vauban, Germany. ""Vauban's streets are completely 'car-free'..."" (Rosenthal, paragraph 2, Source 1). In result to this change, less carbon is being emitted while providing a safe and secure environment for the families that live there. Another city who has made a similar change like Vauban is the city of Bogota in Colombia. ""It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million"" (Andrew Selsky, Paragraph 21, Source 3). The goal of this event is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Here in the United States, car sales and the amount of people getting a driver's license has diminished. ""...the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends... Likewise, the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including shared van services for getting to work"" (Elisabeth Rosenthal, Paragraph 35, Source 4). So even though we may not realize it, technology has allowed us to stay connected without having to burn gas and harm the environment while trying to go to your friend's house. These efforts to decrease the use of cars have been a success in the amount of people participating and the beneficial effects to the environment, like Paris and the decreasing amount of smog.

As countries start to realize the amount of cars and emissions they produce, projects have gone in to make city streets more accessible for alternative vehicles. ""...stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway"" (Elisabeth Rosenthal, Paragraph 6, source 1). This approach forces people to walk or ride a bike instead of driving a car into the city center. ""...uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks...rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic..."" (Andrew Selsky, Paragraph 28, Source 3). In conclusion, there have been many efforts in order to promote alternative ways of transportation into cities .

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage include the decreased emissions of carbon into the atmosphere, the use of alternative transportation through exercise, and the reformation of cities to become safer with easier access to certain shops and venues. As time goes on, awareness of greenhouse gases and carbon emissions increases, and more and more things are done in order to stop the diminishing of our environment.",0
"Technology has had the biggest impact on human interaction. Most people might say it's made a positive impact on people's lives while others may disagree and say it's had a negative impact on people's lives. There may be some pros and there may be some cons to this situation. Can the impact of technology be a good or bad outcome?

Let's start off with the pros or the positive effects technology has had on people's lives, now technology has made people's lives easier. Some may say because it's easier to access what they need easier online instead of heading to the market. Some may also say it's easier and faster to call your friends or parents, any family member really, instead of driving all the way to them, which is true. Watching movies on your phone instead of going all the way to the movie theater and pay for your ticket and it only being a one time thing. There are countless positives outcomes of how technology has increased over the years. The technology nowadays makes everything faster and easier on people's lives. Unfortunately, all these great, glamorous, fast, and easy ways have some downfall to them.

Now, technology definitely has it's flaws and negative impacts on people's lives. Most can say there's not as much human interactions since technology has been brought upon people. Communication is key when interacting with one another. Today most people are also glued to their cellular device, not physically but you get the point. Especially teenagers, they have a bad habit of not being able to put down their cellphone. Whether that being during school hours, at home when you're supposed to be doing work, and maybe even at work. The generation we have today is usually all about social media, and just being on their cellphone in general 24/7. Point blank there's just no physical, verbal communication anymore between one another. It may be causing a lot of students to slack in school, and it may not only go for students and teenagers, they're not the only victims. Some particular parents may be also glued to their cellphone just as teenagers. It's not their fault nor do the teenagers have any fault in this. All this is because of the evolution of technology. It's not pleasant to live in a world with not so much communication and everyone being constantly glued to their cellphone nor is it pleasant to do awful in school because you can't put your cellular device down. Now, these are just some reasons and examples why technology has a negative impact on people's lives. Can you imagine how many more scenarios like this happen daily?

Though technology has evolved drastically through out the years and is still evolving now as we speak, there's always going going to be positive and negative impacts. Technology does help and allow people to complete tasks without having contact with others. There's the problem right there, there's no communication. Even though there are some positive effects of technology that doesn't change the fact that there are more negative effects than positive. Technology effects each person a different way, whether that being in a positive way or whether that being in a negative way. It's all a mix, and by mix I refer to positive effects and negative effects all over the place. Some people may disagree or may agree whether it's a bad mixture or a good mixture. Cell phones and all technology can make it easier or harder for certain people.

Whether if it truly is a positive or negative impact it will not change what people think or at what position they're in. Some people just like taking the easy way out and not cope with what they are losing and missing out on, communication. Human communication and interactions are not it anymore. Everyone's opinion and saying on this dilemma is different, people's mindsets are different even their actions are different from everyone else's,but this is my opinion. In conclusion, that is why I strongly, and genuinely believe technology has a negative effect on people's lives.            ",0
"Cars have been used as the main means of transportation for a long time now, but just because we have counted on it for such a long time doesnt mean there are not better ways. There are a ton of advantages for limiting car usage. Lower emissions, conserving resources, and it make us more healthier are just some of the reaons ways that limiting car usage will improve our daily lifestyles.

To begin with, one of the advantages of limting car usage is improved emissions. Today cities all around are poisoning people with toxic air, cars being the main contributers. But it doesnt have to be this way, some cities are doing things to change. In Paris, after days of nearrecord pollution, the city enforced a partial driving ban to clear up the global city. Also in Bogota, Columbia has made a difference by incorporating a yearly Day Without Cars. One day out of the entire year is not going to clear up the global air quality but it does opens peoples eyes up to alternative ways of getting around without the use of cars. A businessman even reported that it is a good opportunity to take aways stresses. For the first time, two other Columbian cities have joined in on the event. All of this just proves that cars arent the only way.

In addition to lowering emissions, another advantage of limiting car usage is it would conserve resources. Think about how many cars are in the world. THERE ARE ALOT! So every car in the world uses resources to keep it running, even electric and hybrid cars eventhough they are a great alternative. But most use fossil fuels. The world doesnt have a unlimited supply of fossil fuels. It took millions of years t make the gas we put in our cars. So eventually we will run out and when we do it will take a very long time to get it back. Also think about the generation of people after us. What will we leave behind for them?

Lastly, limiting the use of cars will improve our heath. Before the invention of cars most of the population who walk. Eventhough it would take longer to get from place to place it will benefit use also. American, sadly, is probably the laziest county in the world. You rarely see people walking or riding a bike to and form work on a daily basis eventhough in real busy cities you probably would get to and from work faster cause you wouldnt have to wait in the morning or evening rush hour. Its also ceeper than using your cars, you are going to spend a rediculous amount of money on gas in a year, so think it will help the environment and your wallet.

A study last year has showed that driving by young people has decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. Maybe we are the generation to make the change to other ways of getting around, advantages being lower emissions, conservation of resources, and a healthier you. So just remember the next time you have ot go to the store, just take a bike.",0
"Phones & Driving

One major impact on our society today is the usage of cell phones. So many people in the world today uses their cellular device on daily basis. Rather its usage is for an alarm clock, social media, or texting. People don't even like to have phone conversations anymore they just text that particular person they want to speak to their entire thoughts. Another major impact in today's society with these phones is driving and using them.

Typically teens from the age of 16 to the adult age of approximately 25 are affected by texting and driving. These people affected by texting and driving are mainly because people feel like once they phone rings they must immediately See who their being texted by, called by, or any notified from on social media. Most of the time that's can cause you to have an accident, which also may lead up to a death. Many little distractions are putting other drivers, pedestrians, and yourself at risk of being in serious dangerous accident.

In conclusion I say all this to say that be a safe driver, always pay attention to the road and stay off your phone.",0
"Driving at times can be a really big issue to deal with. There are so many thing that can go wrong, a crash, then increase in insurance, you might even get your license taken away after that. When you don't drive, the world is an open book just waiting to be read. Walking or riding bikes can relieve stress and make you more fit and in shape. The gasses that come from cars are just aweful for the environment, and there would be such a largly reduced number in traffic jams if people would just get off the road. Once your on the road, anything can happen. It's dangerous, i sometimes even wonder if i really want a license.

When you drive there are so many traffic jams. The idea of never having to worry about traffic again is intriguing. Why worry about having to rush through traffic just to get to work on time, when instead you can simply manage your time correctly and walk at the pace you are comfortable with. Traffic jams cause accidents that put peoples lives at risk. In the article, ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in booga"" by Andrew Selsky, he states, ""...millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a carfree day...leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams"". The carfree day in Colombia is working to perfection to promote alternative transportation, i don't see why we dont have this in the United States.

driving causes stress and tension and that's never good. A stressed driver is a dangerous driver, when you're stressed you become more careless and less aware of your surroundings and that is very dangerous as a driver it leads to reckless driving and accidents. Being without a car relieves this stress for many people. In the article, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, a quote from the article states, ""When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter. This shows that cars are a lot to handle and that most people just believe it is too much stress for one person to deal with.

The smog and pollution caused by all the cars that are on the road these days is another reason why it is best to stay off the road. In the article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, he says, ""The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world"". The cities ban on cars on the road shows a serious concern in the saftey of the people because of all the smog that driving has caused.

Some people might argue that cars would be faster, but if you take a car you are going to be mor at risk of an accident, you're going to be polluting the air, and you'll only be stressing yourself out in the process. I strongly suggest that America does something to change our ways, because if we don't, we'll end up like Beijing and Paris with an extremly high pollution rate.",0
"The use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is smart and could be usefull but, it could also be a bad idea. Being able to know everything that the student is feeling can help teachers understand them more. If a student was in danger and didn't feel safe the teacher would know and be able to help them. Teachers will have to ask their students if its okay to read their emotions because peoples emotions are very personal.

A teacher being able to uderstand students through their emotion can help teachers know more about how to work with them. For example, in the article this is said by Dr. Huang ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". According to this part of the text computers know how to change a lesson based off your emotion. That means that teachers being able to know your emotion can do the same.

I also feel that this is invading someones personal space. If someone wanted you to know what was going on in their life and wanted you to know how they are feeling they will tell you. Thats why I think asking for the students permission is important before updating their technology. Another thing is why understand computers, in the passage this is said ""developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate"" but why? I dont think computers and humans need to communicate but, I do think humans need to communicate with other humans. I feel that you don't need technology to know how someone is feeling because you could just talk to them if you think something is wrong or if they arn't understanding the lesson that you are trying to teach them.",0
"The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. It is important to study Venus because it is simular to Earth. It is closest to Earth by density and size. It is difficult to study because it is super hot. NASA is working on a plan to find out more about and explore Venus.

Venus is simular to Earth because they have streams like we do on Earth. They also have said there is a chance of life up there. Long ago Venus was probably covered with oceans. Venus has many things like Earth. They still have rocky surfaces and mountains and craters. Venus is also are nearest option for a planitary visit.

It is dangerous to be on Venus because it is so hot. Temperatures can average over 800 degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric oressure is 90 times greater than what we experience. They could have erupting volcanoes and extreme weather. Another thing they could have is super powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning. They have a super thick atmosphere which could be dangerous to get to.

NASA is trying to find out things about Venus, so we can get new things to possibly go there in the future. NASA is trying to find something that can withstand the heat of it and stay there for a few hours. They could study the life there and find out about it. They want to get close and they think machines will help them do that.

The author supports the idea that studying Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers. Venus is simular to Earth. Venus once had oceans like the Earth does now. NASA and scientists are looking into possible ways to explore Venus. This exploration will help find new facts about Venus.",0
"Do you want to know some enjoyable ways to do at the park? Well, at the park you can walk your dog, you can have a picnic with family or friends, some parks have animals you can look at, and you can ride your bike, skate board, and scooter.

One enjoyable thing to do at the park is, you can walk our dog. While you are walking your do, you are also getting some exercise by walking with them. It's also fun because the dog can explore new places to go to.

Also it's somewhere you can take your dog to go out and enjoy nature with you. Some dogs like walking, so a park is a good place to take them to go walk. Also you and your dog can have some time together.

Another enjoyable way to do at the park is, you can have a picnic with your family of friends. Having a picnic is fun because you get to talk to the person with you and eat with them. Having picnics at the park can be good for example, the weather when it is hot or warm or it is a beautiful day outside. When you are done with your picnic you can go and explore more of the park. If you brought someone with you and they never been there before then they might like it and they would want to come back again.

Third enjoyable way to do at the park is, some parks have animals you can look at. It is enjoyable to look at the animals for example, the bears, fishes, turtles, goats, chickens, and pigs. You can also go look at the pig races. There could be some animals you may have never seen before. Sometimes when you go see the animals at the park some people can tell you some stuff to learn about the animal like where is is from or what it eats and you can feed the animal food that the park provides them to eat.

Last but least, you can ride your bike, stake board, and scooter. At the park you can learn how to ride the the thing you brought and practice. The park is also a safer place because there won't be a lot of cars. While you are riding on what you brought with you, it is fun to ride it while you see the beautiful features of the park. It is a good place to go and play with your friends with bikes, skate boards, and scooters because the park is safer than the street and might be a big park to play at with your friends.",0
"To the author, the limitations that exploring venus brings, should not be enough to kill the curiosity that many of us have. Although it has been a long time since a spacecraft has touched down on Venus, the author believes that with the technology and willpower we have today, Venus could be explored.

The author keeps referring to Venus as earth's twin. this could show that the author is trying to get across that this planet is not much different from ours. This technique can help pursuade people into believing that it is beyond possible to touch down on Venus. The author writes about alot of the reasons why we could go to Venus, but makes sure to touch on the challenges people may face and the limitations. ""Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface."" These limitations stated in paragraph 3 of the article are just some of the challenges associated with exploring Venus.

The author believes even with all of the limitations, studying Venus could have so many benefits in the future. But another limitation is that hovering Venus at a safe distance might not give the insight on the conditions that people may need. Although he seems to be focusing on the negatives of it all, he brings in light to work around the limits. ""NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for weeks in such conditions."" Here the author is bringing in the positives which ultimately outweigh the negatives. The limitations seemed to revolve around the harsh conditions, but the author introducing this peice of technology that would work around it helps support the authors ideas.

To conclude, the author has many doubts and fears about studying Venus, but remembers to tell about ways to work around the natural challenges the people would face. The authors idea that claims that studying venus is more important than the dangers pursuades many people into believing that as well. Finally, the author does a great job getting his point across.",0
"People tend to use there cars so much, they basically can't live or get through the day with out their car. We use the car to go every where rather it's to the grocery store , work or just to go hang out with friends and family! Just traveling in general. Well imagine if we limited the usage of cars in our community! I strongly believe that doing this would have many advantages to our community for many reasons like it will make people less stressful all the time, there would be less accidents and it would definitly be better for the environment.

OMG I ran out of gas or OH my i have to take my car to the shop to get it fixed is usually the two main things you hear people stay when the word ""car"" comes up. Having a car comes with alot of stress because it of expenses and having to take of its every need and usually when someone is stressed they are not the best person you wanna have a conversation with. I think that if we limit the usage of cars a lot of people in the community will be alot happier. According to the article

""Car-free Cities""

by

Elisabeth Rosenthal in source 2 a lady name Heidrun Walter says "" When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" and i think that is a perfect example of limited car usauage can make a person happier.

In addition, I feel that if that if we limit the car usage in our community it will make this community a much safer environment. We hear and see about many car accidents in our country and community and cars can be very very dangerous. People often get injuried and/or die in car recks to. So limitting the car usage in the communitry will keep people more safe and most importantly alive . Kids will be able to run aroumd the neighborhood and play with their friends and also cross the street safely without the disruption of a car coming and stopping them from what they are doing  because they do not wants to get hurt from the car coming because they do not know who is driving the car.

Last but not least limiting the use of car usage in the community because it would definitly be better for the environment. In science class we often talk about how cars polute the air and just mess up the waehter in the car and me my self i can also feel the car changing the more i see cars more cars in the streets. I think that it makes the days hotter and i also think that it makes the winters come around earlier and it makes it alot more colder. I live in the Sunshine florida and in the south. So all year round its usually hot extremly hot but has i realize more people are driving around the winers seem ALOT more cold then it usually is and the cold last for longer periods of time.

In conclusion, I belive that if we limit the car usuage in our community it will make it a better place for many reasons. Like it will make people less stressful and  be happier, there will be less accidents on the road and it will also help the environment a lot.",0
"Sometimes classrooms can be very confusing to both teachers and students. With new computer software that can recognize emotions, the classroom environment can be greatly improved. The computer is able to detect a variety of different emotions from surprise and sadness. This advanced technology can help with students who are afraid of asking a question they think is dumb, students who don't care enough to ask questions, teachers detecting if a student is lying and exercises that have students fake emotions until they become real. The use of this technology would change students' and teachers' school experience.

A quote by Prof. Thomas Huang says, ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" With the Facial Action Coding System, computers would be very useful in the classroom because many students are to afraid to ask questions, or they just don't care enough to ask questions. With thid new software computers can detect when a student isn't understanding the concept, bored of the lesson or completely zoned out. The teacher can also be aware of the class weaknesses and strengths. Knowing this feedback would create a better learning environment for the student and teacher.

Going along with the idea of technology that reads your emotions, according to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even produce them. This exercise can be significant in the classroom by having the students fake emotions until the emotions become genuine. If students simply do smiling exercises before a test it could possibly relieve potential nerves, resulting in better test scores. This exercise could also be used when they are being taught a lesson. The student could practice a serious face multiple times until they feel serious enough to focus on the lesson. Advanced computers can read these emotions and detect whether these exercises were beneficial.

""To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" - Since this statement can be used during scenarios including politicians, it can be applied to everyday situations like students in a classroom. Things like cheating on tests, plagiarism and lying about getting work done in time are all common practices done by many students. With the use of the advanced technology, teachers can detect whenever either of those happen, thus bettering the student in the long run. This can also result in students never doing these things again because they know they will get caught.

All of these claims are evidence that advanced technology would be very valuable in a classroom setting. If every school had these computers, the teachers' and students' learning environment would immensely improve. From knowing if a student is lying or not to teachers being able to better their lesson plans, this technology can do it all. Every schools' test scores would go up. Although this software is way beyond our time and a little too much to ask for, it would make school a better place.",0

"I know it seems odd! A human face on Mars! A lot of people have thier ideas on what it is. Some say it was an ancient civilization or people like you belive it's aliens. Well, im here to change your mind with the truth.

NASA looked into this ""face"" a lot more. Me and my crew where up all night for days just digging deeper for more information! Finally, after days of reserch I got some feed back. I unveild the images of this thing for all to see. It was seen and proven to be a ''huge rock formation'' . You could argue and say aliens made it. Could aliens make rock? Rock natrually happens for alot of reasons but, aliens isn't one of them ! Is there any proven facts that alliens exsist? No. After 18 long years we finally reveled it as a natrual landform.

"When you think of voting for president, do you think of the white house, your nearest voting station, absentee ballots, or Electoral College? Is Electoral college a good thing or does it leave some states in the dust? In my opinion we need to drop electoral college and vote ny popular vote. In the article ""What is the Electoral College?"" The authors,the office of Federal Register, say that ""you help choose your states electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors"".the office of Federal Register p.6. It states that when you vote you are not actually voting for the candidate you want but his or hers electors, Hereby proving that you are not voting for the President of the United States, but for the hope of your vote counting.

Every state has a certain number of electoral votes. Some have high amounts known as ""swing votes"". An example of a swing state would be California with a whoping 55 electoral votes. States like this are more likely to see the candidates speak and do more campaigning, due to the high number of electoral votes. But what about othe states who have to see their future President through a to screen because they dont have as many electoral votes as larger states. For example a less visited state would be Rhode island with only one electoral vote because of the small population. In the passage ""In Defense of the Electoral College:Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" by Richard A. Posner it states that ""They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on averageand for the furthe reason that they will have recieved the most information and attention from the candidates, and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election""posner p.3 swing states. This statement is saying since the bigger states with more electoral votes are the most informed they should be the ones to decide. ""Why are they more informed"" you might ask?, because the are the bigger states and have more attention from the candidates than smaller states. Any state with large Electoral college votes are basically choosing our countrys leader and just because we live in a smaller state means we have very little to no say?

More people would be informed of our candidates and care more about the election if they knew individually they got a say without the rest of the state triumphing over their vote. If a candidate sees that a state with fifty five Electoral College votes is not liking him , and if a state with only three electoral college votes isnt for him, the candidate will go for the higher amount of votes state. How are we supposed to be united and one as a country if a larger state has more votes than a smaller one theefor gets more attention and time from a future President."" Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would if the president were picked by popular vote...""Posner p.5 avoid run off elections. If they have no incentive to pay attention THEN GIVE THEM INCENTIVE! Many people who are the appropriate age to vote complain about people not voting but if they think their vote will not matter than why would they?

Popular vote can insure that every single American can have a vote of their own and not grouped togethe with the rest of the state. I think that knowing your opinion and voice can count and truely make a difference matters in a situation like voting for president. ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president""Plumer p.10. As it says we are not even voting for our president but for votes.

If the United states president was elected by popular vote then it wouldnt matter what states got more attention and ""how many more states do i have to win over to be the president?"" but a true genuine popular vote for the leader of our country. That is why we need to abolish the Electoral College and get on with the popular vote situation.",0
"Limiting car usuage is an advantage to all citizens.  All around the world people are trying pass new laws to band cars.  When people do not use their cars the world becomes less polluted, clear skies would be nice.  Also this will promote a safe lifestyle as a pedestrian. Creating people to walk everyday will be a good habit to the society.

Countries all around the world are realizing that reducing the use of cars is a big success.  "" When i had a car i always was tense.  I'm much happier this way""!  Even people love the lifestyle without their cars.  People are selling their cars and moving to Germany just to live in a place without vehicles. The people that disagree to this decison have no choice but to be fined thirty-five dollars or to be towed away.  People created a more enclosed habitat to citizens so it was not a great distance to walk to the store or even the mall.  "" In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a mainstreet,  rather than in malls along some distant highway.""  People around the United State are becoming less dependent on their cars.

Therefore, the less you use your vehicle the less populated the city will be.  The air will become clear as the car usuage lessens.  In Paris they enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air.  People were fined thirty-one dollars if saw on the road.  The smog creates congestion in the air.  Also as the seasons change the warmer layer of air traps car emissions.  Seeing a clear picture is more important than driving a car when it is not necessary.

In addition, banning the use of cars will improve the safety of our citizens.  Creating cities in which ""pedestrians, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to improve our safety.""  Not worrying about traffic and when you can or cannot cross the street would be very meaningful to our lives.  Accidents happen everyday, most deaths come from terrible car crashes.  There are a lot of dangerous things about driving, why would we need to risk our lives?  Stay safe and walk, run and rollerblade instead of wasting your life in a car that can risk it.

In conclusion, there are many advantages of limiting car usage.  People are now considering to band vehicles which will improve the safety of citizens and make a less polluted economy. Nobody would deny the advantages of being more eco-friendly by decreasing the usage of cars. Everyone wants a safe enviroment and clear air to breathe!",0
"Have you ever needed advice from someone? If so, you probably talked to multiple people before you went on with what you were going to do. Some of the many reasons people do this include getting different perspectives, see the other side of an issue, and get more information on the subject.

The biggest reason someone may ask another person for advice is because there are different perspectives that can go with a subject. You can talk to people you may not see eye to eye with and get insight on their differing opinion. This leads to good discussions with people on the topic you're trying to learn about through the information you're given.

With advice, you want to know the other side of something and if what you're going to do is right or wrong. You can develop potential arguments to strengthen your side and you can know everyone's views to go along with your subject. Based on what you learn from everyone, you could get the full circle of information on what you'd like to learn about.

Lastly, you get more advice as well from asking others for advice. You can learn from other's experience, and in the end learn from your own. You'll know what went wrong in what the person did and why you're getting that advice. Other people will also think one thing is more important than the other. You'll have an overall bigger decision to make in the end with who's advice you're going to follow and how you're going to do it.

People ask other people for advice because they can get different perspectives, see the other side of something, and have the most information they could get. Everyone needs advice at some point in time and with the information they get from others, they can make the best decisions possible.",0
"It is my pleasure to take this great opportunity to express my view or opinion on the above topic; which is positive attitude is the key to success in life?.First and foremost i would like to briefly talk about the term attitude, it can be shorty defined as a good or bad conduct or manner ones shows in public or the kind of act you put up which is either good or bad. If we really take good look at how people live,attitude is the most relevant thing they mostly pay attention to, lets talk about work school.

WORK OR SCHOOL:

If we take good look at this two places, we can see or sort of attitudes aspects, either good or bad that is coming from the students,teachers and many more , showing good attitudes towards others shows how respect you are and what kind of family you came from, most people had a good relationship with others because of their good attitude they have acquire from school or at home,students with good attitude are more easily to associate themselves among others, and become very good friends , teachers really love students who always show a good attitude, sometimes too they can earn some gift from others.

HOME OR CHURCH:

This really take places in our various houses, showing good attitude to your parents or it can anyone ,mostly help to gain favors from people you might not even know they might be your futures helper, because there is a saying nobody knows tomorrow, for instance you went out and some random person ask if you can help him or her to find a place but your attitude did not let him even to ask you anymore ,but imagine some few years later came and you met such same person that ask for your assitance but your attitude was not good at all, maybe he is a manager at your dream job you have prayed to work there, so as soon as you get there you saw he is the one who is going to interview you do you think he will be willing to gave you such opportunity even though you qualified the answer is no he will find any means to let you not get that job , your bad attitude ruin up your whole life, this goes to church too,having positive attitude at church draws human being more closer to God and attract more blessings from him as well.

POSITIVE ATTITUDE AMONG INDIVIDUALS;

Last but not the least is the kind of attitude we gave among ourselves ,this has become a daily rampant that need to failure to get help from other people, imagine you had like 4 close friends but they are be asking for your help on something but some of them attitude is very pathetic , but insisted they really need your help and what you have on you can only help few of them, so would you go ahead and help those who had a negative attitude the answer may be no,because you going to help those of your friends whose had a good attitude first before you assist them too , this really tell us having positive attitude can really gave you so many opportunities or advantages.

THESE ARE SOME MERITS OF POSITIVE ATTITUDE:

1. It creates good interpersonal relationship among individual.

2. It easily to get favor from other people.

3. It always bring peace among others.

4. It really depict the kind of family you came from or the type of trained you have acquired.

THESE ARE SOME VITAL OR MAJOR REASON WHY WE SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE A POSITIVE ATTITUDE;

1. B

ecause it enable individuals to always have a good name in any places they found their selves in and, it also promote economic living,

because you individuals really knows good your attitude is so therefore they will always be proud to share their issues or problems with you without been hesitate.

2. It attract blessings from God , because the bible is even against anyone who does not show a positive attitude among his or her neighbor, and can make your life been successful with the help of blessings you getting from your creator.

HOW POSITIVE

ATTITUDE HELP US IN OUR OWN LIVES;

having positive attitude really help individuals a lot because this earth we live in everything is about attitude even assuming you apply for a job and they monitor you for awhile then later realized you had a bad attitude, do you think the person who is in charge of that work will be willing to hired you the answer is no, because no one can hired someone who has a negative attitude, so imagine now you had positive attitude everything is excellent you even feel proud of yourselves you do not even care wherever you might find yourself in because your attitude is really good and it can gave you so many chances in life that you think you not even to have it, you can also become a remodel to some people , they might even look at you and learn from you , so therefore is very good to have a positive attitude and move free wherever you go , some people really pay attention to people attitudes even more than everything in this word.

CONCLUSION;

Due to time factor i would like to bring my above oppinous to an end and i am pretty sure it may be taking into consideraton and publish it for other people to have access to read and if they had to made some changes in their lives they can surely do so to it.

Thank you.                                                                                                                                  ",0
"I think the technologhy to read students emotional spreeions is a great idea because it can tell you if you sad happy angery disgusted or fear. On the Mona Lisa smile it tells you how are you felling when you are looking at it. That ehy people and student go look at the Mona Lisa smile panting to go see how are they filling. In the pragh 1 it says that shes 83 percent happy 9 percent disgusred 6 percent fearful. Dr Huang asked if they can calculate emotions like math homework and how can a computer recongnize the subtle facial.

In this process it begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model on the face. Dr huang relies on the work of the pyschologists as Dr Paul Eckman creator of FACS the did the test on Eckman and he had happiness surprise anger disgust fear and sadness. The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intened to bring a smile to eveybody face when you go and see the painting. Making a happy face was a great idea because its bring people happyniess to you becacuse its does not making you angery or sad. that why it was a grat idea about this painting.",0
"Cars are a huge advantage in traveling. They can get people to places faster than a single horse could and their a lot safer than riding on a horse. While there are positive advantages to these moble transportation, there are also negative portions that cars have. You may be awfully surprised what these transports can do outside their good nature. For instance, cars run on fossil fuel, which is a artificial gas that ruins the environment as much as people cutting down trees and smoke coming out of nuclear plants that do damage to the clouds in the sky. Cars don't just hurt the environment, they hurt innocent lives as well. Let me pull out an example: Person A and Person C are driving on the interstate when Person B spills out too much fossil fuel from the exhaust pipe of his car. This causes both Person A & C to spin out of control and crash into each other because they couldn't see the road very well because of Person B. This isn't the only threat cars can pull into, but I'll get to that later. With all these bad occurrences that happen people have been wondering, ""how can we save both lives and the environment from the issues of cars at the same time""? There is a way to do just that: limiting car usage.

Like I said before, cars can have a lot of negative issues in their state of mind. Some examples are foggy weather, over usage of fossil fuel, speeding, texting and driving, drunk driving and many more that exist that I cannot mention. Because of these issues, cities like Vauban Germany, Paris France and Bogota Colombia have bannedwell not really banned but you get what i mean driving cars due to the bad issues cars canhave caused. In the US, the presentage of people driving cars has decreased a lot over the past few years the story doesn't say what persentage. As much as I hate them doing that, they actually have a reason. In this case of fellow citizens, car usage should be banned for various reasons. I won't be telling all the reasons because that would take a long time to do so.

Reason 1: Drunk driving. Have you ever known someone or heard about an incident were a person is drunk inside a car and crashes into any random source they don't see coming? Well, let us face the facts: drunk people should not drive. If someone is drunk at a bar and is feeling funny, they should either walk home or get someone to pick them up. Drunk people who drive have a great chance at getting someone hurt of themselves hurt because of their stupid attitude. The person shouldn't drive again until they are fully consious again. Reason 2: Extreme weather. When people drive in extreme, they are risking their lives in a greater persentage than a zombie apocolypse, terrorists invading any country and being attacked by people who try to kill you. Extreme weather like thunderstorms, hail and strong fog are too dangerous for people to drive in. If you drive in that type of weather, there is a 90% chance you will not make it out without injuries. People need to wait for the weather to either calm down or stop completelyI just wait until it stops completely so that it wouldn't get worse as it calms down. This will help them prevent them or anyone from getting a wreck. If it occurs randomly while your driving then your screwed. Reason 3: texting and driving. Why is it that most people in this generation keep getting stupid and stupid every single minute? This is one of those incidents that has such that. People who text while driving pay more attention to their stupid phone than focusing on driving. Like drunk driving people who care about texting so much need to either sit in the back and text or not ride in the car at all. They propably should stay away from a car as long as possible until they learn to not text and drive at the same time. You can't do two things at once unless you're some one fictional or a pro at it. Final reason: Expoit of fossil fuels. I don't need to talk much about this one because I already did in my first paragraph and it is related to the extreme weather topic but I will do it once more. Cars that exploit fossil fuels can cause damage to the environment. If the smoke is exploited too much it can not only more damage to the environment, but it can cause people to reck as well.

These are the reasons that fellow citizens like you should limit your car usages. Remember that cars are not a same transportation vehicle that can get you from point A to Point B, they have a dark side like everything else. Even if you do limit your car usages, it doesn't mean you are safe from the world that hunts you down. Be careful out there and follow the percautions of safty carefully when you are traveling either by car or anyother place.",0
"Intro

Do you want a messed up system to control who is voted for president, or would you want to vote for who becomes president? In my favor, I would choose the most popular vote for president. In my defense people should vote for president and not have higher ranked people vote for president. To be clear with you,

The Electoral College should not be used.

Would you want to vote for who becomes president?

I would love to vote for who would become president. Why would you let people that do not live the life you live vote for you, you need to vote for who you think will be a great president for you.

For EX.

I'm living in a retirement home and I cant pay for my dentures I would need to vote for a president that allows charity for retirement homes. different people need different presidents we all can't have a different president so we all need one that we all agree on. people living in the white house do not know what we want so why would you want them to vote.

Would you use

The Electoral College

?

I would love to vote for who would become president. Why would you let people that do not live the life you live vote for you, you need to vote for who you think will be a great president for you.

For EX.

I'm living in a retirement home and I cant pay for my dentures I would need to vote for a president that allows charity for retirement homes. different people need different presidents we all can't have a different president so we all need one that we all agree on. people living in the white house do not know what we want so why would you want them to vote.

Which statement sounds resonable?

voting for president is more reasonable. to me thats what i say.",0
"Cars, they're one of the most important means of transportations, varing from busses down to smart cars. The more cars being bought and used, the more pollution it makes. Researchers are saying that cars, their dense amount of smog being created, are damaging the Earth. Logically, it would be easier to say that limiting the amount of vehicles being used would allow for a cleaner city or town.

Limiting car usage in the past and present already shows a positive feed back upon the community. There has been cities dedicated to create a car-free city. An example would be in Vauban, Germany. There the city runs purely on no car usage and showed to be much cleaner, safer, and easier to navigate around in. It says in the first passage how the city is ""...better for walking..."" and that it is ""...more compact and more accessible to public transportation..."" In other areas, where car usage is an everyday expense, they have started to enforce driving bans to reduce pollution in the area. In Paris, they almost reached near-record pollution which reduced greatly ever since the ban. They limited the use of cars has cleaned the air and their ""congestion"" was down 60 percent allowing getting around easier. Although having car free cities and bans, others thing differently.

Others, whom oppose the idea of limiting cars use, has done research to show that it isn't necessary to limit car usage. They state that in America ""Americans are buying fewer and fewer cars"" They claim that the drop of perchasing and that the usage of cars is dropping to the point where pollution won't raise up anymore. In source 4, it states ""If the patterns persists it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the envrionment"" It also states that people will ""find less reason to resume the habit""

Although some advantages are seen in the opposing ideas, it still would not be enough. The passage focuses to much in one area instead of looking around. Limiting car usage would asist around the world proving to be much efficient. There are programs that are created to reduce the usage of cars for one day, which showed to be a success. In source 3 it shows how 118 miles of bicycel paths has been created since the day. Also shows how the day cut trafic and allowed for constructions of new buildings to be much easier to do. People started to go outside to the point where ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating,"" said Bogota.

The advantages of car limitations has shown to be much more efficient and benificial towards cities and towns which participated in it. The advantages are that it made the town more productive, cleaner, efficient, and better to walk around in. Car limitations has proven to be an outstanding practice to be used around the world.",0
"The face as you call it is just a natural land formation. We took pictures that prove us correct but you still think it was created by aliens. All we saw was that it was a mesa and that its shaddows look like a face. So why dont you belive us if you lok colsely at the 1998 picture you can clearly see no alien markings but yet you still belive why. Every body else belives us why cant you all you we see is a big rock so why do you think aliens put it there.

In the article it clearly states that the so called face was not made by aliens but just natural formations. There is no life what so ever on mars. It was not made by aliens but instead by mother nature. It was found in cydonia where a lot of other mesas located there and if that is not proof enough we sent three misions and they all reported it was a mesa nothing more nothing less. Unfortunatly some scientists belived it was an alien artifact so we took more pictures and the showed the exact same thing.

But we sent another mission to take pictures with more pixels and they showed no proof of alien life. But you still dont belive us and I dont understand why you dont belive us. even though we gave you all this proof you dont seem to care. What will it take to convince you that its not a face. If I were you i would have belived NASA as soon as they showed the picture.

But I am not you so

I will try to convince you. But if you reject the idea I will not care.

I will simply leave . So I will. continue when they told the public they even said it was a natural thing but still . the face is not really made by aliens but it is naturaly awsome. so i will leave telling you that you are wrong and that NASA is right. but the face is still cool and if it broke off and fell to earth it would be alien so food for thought.

I think you might be right about one thing the face is so cool. and i think that you are mostly wrong bye",0
"Do you think immagination is more important than knowledge? Why do you think it's important? Let's see why I think it's important! Well think about this you have the knowledge, but you never immagine things that you think you can't do. If you just immagine or think bigger about what you want or what you want to do. One day you will achive your goal or dream.

One of the reason why I think immagination is importantant is that if you don't immagine what you want to do in future as your job or hobby. When your in school your not going to try your best and show effort. If you don't learn anything at school when you are older to get a job, your not going to get the job you want, because wherever you are there will be someone that want the same job as you but trying harder than you, learning harder than you, and showing more effort than you. Which means effort creates achivements. For example, you went to an interview for a job at a store to be a cashier and there are 15 people that want to be cashier. But they only need one. So first they asked everyone what do you do when the costumer comes in. One of them said you have to smile and say hey, do you need help with anything? and you said you continue doing whatever your doing. Who do you think there going to pick? Of course the first one right? because she showed them effort and willing to do the job. That why you have to immagine what you want to do in future and try your best in school.

Second reason is that you have your knowledge, but if you don't immagine or think bigger your not going achive big things in your life. The people who failure in life are the people who quit something one step away from success. That's what a lot of people do. But the people who successed in life are the people who took the step that a lot people quit which the hardest step to take. For example, you want to start a company, but the people around you said that your not going to success. Although they said that you started a company anyways. After a month no one wanted to invest you company. You kept asking people to invest your company. So one person did, with that money you payed the bill. Then nothing happened to your company. But if you stop asking people when no one wanted to invest your company your company would of been closed. So you have to immagine thing and use your knowledge to achive them.

Third reason is you have to immagine things as your dream and get a lot of knowledge by learning at school. When I was little I wanted to become a docter when I grow up. Then I started immagining to help and more stuff. When I go to school. I told myself you have to be good at science, math and other subject to become a docter. So I will have knowledge about things that you have to know to become docter. so you have to get a lot of knowledge to achive the things you immagine.

So I think immagination is more important than knowledge. But knowledge is still really important. I feel like everything starts with immagination first. Then you go to school to get your knowledge increase every year. You work really hard to make immagination becomes reality.    ",0
"Dear mr senator i'm writing you today to ask for changing electoral college votes to popular vote. Becasuse elcltoral votes we not really voting for the person we want and winner-take-all system doesn't work.

on electon day  you may not be voting for the candidate you think your voting for. I think thats not right, not knowing who we are really voting for. Like it says in the article Does the elctoral college work?, states that ""when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for candidates electors"". like seriously who are these ""

electors

"" decicated and loyal to vote for the candidate we thought we were voting for. we should get a staraightforward vote to the president only, we dont need someone chooseing for us. also there's always others saying its eaiser, it'll be better i understand and see where they coming from but the american people the real voters want a voice. also the winner-take-all system is just like not fair. like it says in the article, ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all, including rhode island and south carolina and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a single campaign ad"". how are voters supposed to vote an cant even see who or why to vote for the candidate. also a situation could arise the state could almost be half an half and a candidate has slighty more votes than the other the whole electoral votes goes to him/she, the others who voted are left dumbfounded like where did my votes go, thats not fair to the american people.

Mr. senator im asking you today just to please put this in considerationg cause electoral votes are not letting us vote for the candidate we want and the winner-take-all system doesn't work.",0
"This article about the Facial Acting Coding System could be valuable. Though it may not be exactly needed it could be used when looking at a criminal and seeing what emotions they are hiding under the fake smile or crying face they have. This facial coding system could be used to help students who are struggling and what help but cant get the nerve to ask for it. Since technology is becoming a way of life this is just another step forward to becoming closer to computers and for them to understand us better.

In paragraph 1, It showed an example of Mona Lisa. In paragraph 5 it talks about how Da Vinci would study human anatomy to help him paint facial muscles precisely to show true emotions. For them to do Mona Lisa was brilliant because everyone knows who she is and Da Vinci studied human anatomy to show strong emotions. This could be valuable to schools because students make it hard for other students to show their true emotions. By using this facial coding systen teachers and administration could see what students are truly struggling with. It could be their math homework or maybe a problem with family. They could see their emotions in the computer while at home and at school to see how they act differently. This system could make school a more welcoming and fun to place to come to. In paragraph 6 it says this computer technology could make a boring lesson more interesting to the specific student. Every student has different like so this would be very valuable to schools.

Through this all it would be valuable for schools to invest in this product because it would make the school more fun for students and allowing them to learn more by the facial system allowing them to recognize what makes them happy and what makes them annoyed or bored. It would also be valuable to buy this because students could have fun learning about it and seeing how it works and may show them what they want to do in the future by showing what the future may turn out to be with new technology.",0
"Cars have been the main focus of development for many years now. Engineers attempt to create sufficient cars every time a new model is planned. Many citizens of the United States are slightly aware of the environmental damage that is caused by the cars, yet still do no think twice when it comes to driving anywhere. Many countries around the world have set fines and laws against using cars and have seemed to produce a positive outcome. These countries offer many different alternatives to using cars, creating a well developed society.

While cars are a huge advantage to modern day society, they take a big toll on our environment. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal, from the Company, cars are the ""second largest source of America's emission"" proving how much we rely on cars source 4 paragraph 34.She also writes about numbers terrifying to the future generations. United States is responsible for 50 percent greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe while Europe is only responsible for 12source 1 paragraph 5. 50 percent is proof that Americans are too reliable on transportation sources like streets, main roads, and highways. Paris was able to clear the air from pollution. According to Robert Duffer from the Chicago Tribune ,after enforcing a driving ban, the air cleared after an almost record setting pollution fog source 2 paragraph 10. Places in Asia like Beijing, China are just filled with smog in the air. The citizens walk around with masks because of the heavy pollution. That is physically dangerous for not only the adults, but the children of the communities. There has to be some alternatives to using cars in excess. Almost anything can be an advantage but when it is used too much, it will always be dangerous.

Even though cars are important to commerce within society, many alternatives can be taken to help lower the usage of cars. In places like the capital of Columbia, they have found a way to travel places and limit the car use. Andrew Selsky, from the Seattle Times , speaks of this matter. He claims that there has been ""construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths"" in the city of Bogota source 3 paragraph 27. Not only does this allow the citizens to be environmentally friendly, but it gives them a chance to exercise, which leads to better health. It is noticeable the the healthier people tend to be more lifting than the sluggish, corpulent citizens. In Barcelona, Spain, being a vehicle owner is simple undesired. Other means of transportation like walking or bicycling have been the desired means of getting places. Even Bill Ford, the chairman of Ford Motor Company, admits to the impractical use of cars in excess. There are some many different ways the we can reduce the use of Cars in the American nation.

With the ability of using bikes to arrive at destinations, many places have seen the improvements in reduced traffic jams. What Americans hate the most are traffic jams. Think about those times when 10 minutes have slipped away in the morning and you are running late then there is a traffic jam. Millions in Columbia participated in hiking or biking and it left the street nearly empty source 3 paragraph 20. The citizens were smart enough to recognize when they need a car. When going to work that is only 5 miles away, they take the extra time to reduce the usage of the streets. France experienced the same result, reducing traffic congestion by 60 percent, and then lowering the smog that had covered them source 2 paragraph 14. This leaves the street safer for drivers and pedestrians. It also reduces the heavy noise from motored vehicles.

Many nations have improved their societies by reducing the use of cars. In result, the air pollution is reduced, the health benefits improve, and the traffic congestion is heavily reduced. Not only can reducing our relience on cars benefit our genertaion, but it can benefit the generations to come.",0
"""Carfree"" Many drivers around the world are deciding to take a break from driving and have now decided to ""think green."" Although some may disagree that this could be helpful toward the environment there is evidence that says it is helpful. Some may not see the point and think that this new epidemic is inconvenient but maybe they just are not educated about these new ideas.

Throughout the globe multiple cities have found ways to use some forms of public transportation, riding bicycles, and even walking to get themselves where they need to go. For example, Bogota, Colombia has a ""carfree"" day every year where only public transportation is available. Like Enrique rivera said in paragraph 26 the people of this city in Colombia are a part of this great change that encourages others to join in. The author also states in paragraph 28 that there is new parks and sidewalks which would have a positive affect on the attractiveness of their city.

Imagine having a ""carfree"" day everyday of the year. That is exactly what a new city in German has done. Vauban, German was built in 2006 as a suburb with no real streets or parking spaces. Citizen of this new city only have to places to park their cars, in a large garages outside of town with a space costing 40,000 or in their home. As said in paragraph 3 most of the families in Vauban do not own a car and more than half sold their cars to move into the ""carfree"" city. Most of the citizens feel less stressed and more relaxed about no longer having a car also.

Surely you're thinking ""What about the U.S.? They're one of the most powerful countries in the world they must have some insite on this new trend."" As a matter of fact they do. The U.S. has slowly started to take a break from the automobile. More and more of the new generations have decided to not get their driver's licenses. In most big cities in the U.S. such as New York most of their citizens do not own a car and rather just walk or use other transportation due to traffic. It can be easier just to walk somewhere rather than to sit in a car thats bascially parked due to such bad traffic. In other parts of the U.S., there is a new trend of carpooling which can not only have a positive impact on the environment but can also save you money. In paragraph 43, even Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, agrees that less use of a car can have a positive impact.

Overall, the reduction of private vehicle transportation can help reduce the negative affects on the environment and on other aspects of life such as stress level. Multiple countries have started to join in this new worldwide idea of how to make this world a better environment for the future and most all of them have contrirbuted having others try it out. If we all are willing to give up a little for one thing it can make a big difference for everyone in the world's future.",0
"Have you ever been stuck, not knowing what choice is best? Well, seeking multiple opinions can help you make better decisions in many ways. Gaining input from your peers, parents, or teachers can help give you new ideas, stop you from doing something you'll regret, and even make you more confident in your own decisions.

Seeking for the advice and opinions of others can help you make a better choice by opening your mind to new ideas. Being open to the input of the people around you could change the way you think about a certain choice you have to make, and allow you to better weigh your options. Seeking the advice of others has definitely helped me make better decisions. One night, I was so set on going to my friend's house, but I had to watch my little sister. I kept on trying to convince my parents that she could be home alone, when really I just didn't want to have to babysit. Finally, I asked my mom if there was any way I could get around this, and she suggested having my friends over while I babysat. My dad suggested taking her with me to my friend's house. I was so focused on my idea that wasn't getting me anywhere, but when I asked for advice, new ideas were presented to me. It opened my mind to multiple options I'd never thought of before, all better than mine. This helped me make a better choice. You may be stubbornly focused, driving towards one destination in the distance, unable to see any other option. Listening the advice of the people around you can change that, giving you a whole new choice of what you could do, where you could go.

Seeking the advice of others can also help you make better decisions by stopping you from doing something you might regret. Say you're about to make a huge, life-changing decision, or even a small one. It's smart to first ask your peers, parents, or teachers if this is what's best. They may be able to stop you from doing something you will regret in the future. Your parents and teachers have experience, and hearing their input can help you make a better choice. Think about the decisions you have made in you life that you wish you had made differently. Think about how seeking the multiple opinions- from your friends, parents, people you look up to- could have helped you make a better choice. Seeking multiple opinions can show you that the decision you are making isn't the best one for you, and could help you make a choice that you won't regret later in life.

Finally, you may feel more confident in your own decisions after seeking multiple opinions. Maybe you are about to make a decision, but you are't very confident. Seeking the opinions of multiple people can help reinforce your decisions, like an extra set of armor. Last spring, my brother got into two of his top choices for grad school. Both the University of Chicago and Princeton had very good economics programs, which he had a PhD in. It was a very hard decision, so he did his research from multiple sources, including visiting both schools with family. After listening to my parents, his economics professor at his under-grad school, and seeing the schools for himself, he made the decision to go to the University of Chicago. He is finishing up his first year there now, and has loved it. Seeking multiple opinions and sources in this big decision of his life helped him make the choice that was good for him, and made him more confident in his own choice to go there.

Seeking the opinions of multiple people can help you make better choices by opening your mind up to new ideas, stopping you from doing something you might regret, and make you more confident in your own decisions.",0
"Sometimes you don't need a car to go some place, you have choices like take the bus, or use your bike, but sometimes you need a car to go some place far away. I will discuss about the advantages of limiting car usage. I feel that the cars are important but we can live without the because we have others sources to transported and don't expent to much money.

First of all, commercial and public transportation are woven through a connection of network to save time, to conserve resources, lower emissions and to improve safety. Theres a lot of accidents that people commit because a car, sometimes they are tired and don't pay attention to the road, they get distracted by something, and sometimes theres no parking lad for a car. A car is a responsibility. When you have a car you can get tense because, you have to expent you money filling the tank of gas, and repair something if is broken, but sometimes you don't have the money for do that and you take the bus or the subway because is less expensive. People have their cars impounded fot their reaction to the fine, cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. people sometimes said that they can't live without a car, if you get to think, they're sometime wrong because there's many public transportation.

In addition, if people don't have a car it would be a impact to people because everybody would be on the streets, and everything would be full of people, but without a car we can get to safe more the atmosphere. Sometimes we have carfree days to save the environment of our world, it's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution and the turnout was large. The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign. parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city, pitted sidewalks have beed replaced bye broas, smooth sidewalks, arushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic, and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. The united states, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world's prime car culture. With all these canges, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recessin may find less reasons to resume the habit.

In Conclusion, have a car it's a responsibility that people have to have, we don't need a car sometimes, but sometimes we do. I feel that the cars are importants, its fine that we get to save the environment but without a car we don't get to go to place we want to go everytime we want.",0
"The face of Mars could not be created by aliens. It is a land form created by the conditions of mars and looks like a face only by coincidence. Mesa's are common in this area of Mars and there are many others like this one just without the same shadows which makes the appearance of a human's face.

Out of so many different land forms in Cydonia why should this be any different. In the second paragrapgh of the article, it stated that the Cydonia region is known for its buttes and mesas. The face of Mars is just another mesa no different that any other one except for its unique shadows. It is strange to see a formation on an supposedly uninhabited planet that depicts a ""human"" face. Espescially when no human has ever set foot on the planet of Mars before. But at the same time, that is all the more reason to believe that this is nothing more that a weird coincidence since no person has ever been there.

To conspiracy theorists dismay, this strange landform is nothing more than martian butte or mesa and a weird coincidence. It is an interesting formation that stumped and puzzled scientests all over the world. But we now know the formation is not anything that will reveal alien lifeforms or alien activity.",0
"SOME SCHOOLS OFFER DISTANCE LEARNING AS AN OPTION FOR STUDENTS TO ATTEND

CLASSES FROM HOME BY WAY OF ONLINE OR VIDEO CONFERENCING. DO YOU THINK

STUDENTS WOULD BENEFIT FROM BEING ABLE TO ATTEND CLASSES FROM HOME:

Some schools offer distance learning as an option for student to attend classes from home by online or video conferencing. Parents do not want their children to attend classes from home. Students will not get much benefits, whoever if they live in a place that is far away from school or they can't attend school for any reason then its has benefits. I'm not agree that students should attend classes from home because students can have stress, students can not pay attention very well, and the most important fact is that it will affect on students' grades.

The first reason is that the students can get stressed everyone time whenever they attend the class online because i know that its not easy to take classes online. students have to pay more attention. They can not understand very well by online or on video conference. It will be hard for students to learn or to understand their lesson online. Students will be stressed out because no one will be there to help them, not any teacher and either any friend (any other student).

The second reason why students should not take classes at home is that they will not able to pay attention by taking online classes. it does not feel like the school environment. students will spent more time on their school. At least in schools we pay more attention than doing our homework at home, because we mostly spend our time on our devices (cell phone) and on the television by watching episodes, cartoon movies, other movies, and etc.

The third reason is that it also affect on students grades and in the future they can not attend their favorite college. They won't able to understand the lesson, they will get bad grades in all subjects. It is so important to attend the classes at school, then you will know what is going on. students can ask teachers if they are having problems in their lesson. teachers can help them during school timing or after school. It will be easy for students to understand or to pay attention and they can get good grades too in all their subjects.

Students should not take classes at home. It will affect on their grades because they will not able to pay attention, they will get stressed out because if student need help, no one will be there to help them for their studies or their lessons, and it will be hard to pay attention at house by doing online studies.

"All around the world in places such as the United states, Paris and other european countries have all begun to realize the effects cars have on the environment as well as the community. Most of these places have actually banned cars in suburban areas to try to promote this idea that are cars becoming less of a neccesity  throughout communities. Cars are becoming less popular and some advantages to this are that cars cause lots of pollution from tailgates according to source number one. Some other advantages to this decline of cars is the improvement of the community as well as better quality of life with civilians.

Cars are one of the leading reasons pollution is such a big problem today. So one advantage to having less cars would be less pollution. Experts from source two state that up to fifty percent of greenhouse gases could come from the United States alone. Acoording to source two places like Paris have already begun to face the effects of pollution. The pollution in Paris was bad enough to ban cars to reduce the amount of smog in the air. In doing so the lack of cars helped cleared the air for people to breathe easier. Banning cars would also promote an increase to public transportation. With less cars people would be obligated to use public transits or simply walk to where they needed to be. A buisness man from source three named Carlos Arturo Plaza states ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"". This shows that not all feedback from the loss of cars is negative.

Another advantage to the lack of cars is the overall improvment of communities. With the lack of cars workers dont have to spend all there money on construction of new roads and maintenance of highways. People can now begin to finally work on other things such as the improvements of sidewalks and building new parks. In source 3 it states that restrictions have cut traffic makng less people agitated over road rage as well as the upscale of new buisness's and shop markets. Because of all these new markets everything is built closer now since people arent driving theres no need for the buildings to be long distances away. Urbanization is an advantage to lack of cars.

With the lack of cars some peoples quality of life have improved greatly, Enrique riera from source three states ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders."" Implying that these changes are going to spread and become the new thing of today. Some people say they they enjoy this new policy. In source four it states that changes like these can make emmsions lower and improve safety, in doing so people have a better quality of life as they are safer then before.

So in all there were many advantages that had to the reduction of cars in certain areas. With the lack of pollution people were able to get around easier, with nicer places to travel shopping would become more fun then previously, and peoples lives became generally less stressful. With all of this upcoming news about reduction of pollution and new ways to change the environment maybe one day we will live in a world with no cars at all.",0
"Dear,  Florida State Senator

The United States has been a country of freedom since July 4, 1776. Its been a country of laws and being equal since the start.

Presidents are elected every four years. They are elected by the people of the United States. People who elect electors, who some go to the House of Representatives. The United States also consist in states. States that lead to division. That division can be use against or with the people of the US. What many people are fighting about is the system that we get to elect our future Presidents. W hen in reality, half of the people on that side of the agruement have no clue what they are even talking about. In the state of Florida, are many people from all over the nation. People that should be educated on the way this wonderful country is taken care of. The United States should be in favor of keeping the Electoral College because it is accurate, competive and reasonable.

The Electoral College is accurate by many different ways. An example is, when states vote on who the Untied States next president might be it always shows a percentage. The canditates in congress can see what they didn't really work their issues in. Which can give them an idea on what they need to improve on with that state if they make it to be a president. The Electoral College is accurate also  by how simple it is. Simple as in that it is either a yes or a no if they make it to the next round. Having that simple yes or no can time and money.

A competive trait that the Electoral College has is another main reason why the US should keep it. The Untied States is made on states and having individuality. If the United States didn't have that there wouldn't be no Bill of Rights to beging with. Different people in Electoral College as electors are always good to have. They are good to have because they see a different perspective of what needs improvement in the United States. If the President has that trait of being a different person in the government and improves the United States, there wouldn't many main issues with the Unites States.

Being reasonable in the United States is very important. Especailly when it comes to the elections. The Electoral College looks at what peron can qualify to vote. A citizen of the United States is the only person who is allowed to vote. Terrible tings can happen if that wasn't the case. For example, almost a whole country comes over to the United States, and they get to vote without citizenship. They vote someone who is also not a naturalized citizen of the United States and take over this country. That is a worse case scenario of what could happen.

The Electoral College is a way or system that the United Sates has always followed when electing a president. The United States should be in favor of keeping the Electoral College. They should keep it because it is accurate, competive, and reasonable.",0

Show love towards them because the attitude they have might may be really bad, but showing them love can help it improve a lot. Finally, they will slowly improve it might take time. The most important part is having a good attitude towards them even if you think it's not going to help it is because you're showing them how to give a good attitude back to anyone.

Helping someone's day better is by giving them a compliment it can effect them in the most positive way you can think off.

How can you show small acts of kindness to others?                     ",0
"Everyday people die in the car accidents because they use cell phone while driving. According to the research I look up cell phone are leading people to have a car accident studies show that a cell phone put driver in to car accident people still use cell phone because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. 60 percent of teens admitted to risky driving. Nearly half of those drivers admitted to text messaging while driving Edgar Snyder. In April, 2009, in Houston Texas five children lost their lives when the car they were in lost control and slid into a rain swollen ditch. The driver lost control of the vehicle when he went to answer his ringing cell phone. The car went into the ditch and was swept 100 feet down the raging current. The rescue team was unable to reach the car with the trapped passenger. Two adults and one ten year old girl were able to escape, but five children under the age of seven all passed away Argus leader.

"Cars in our society has been a benefical invention that we've had. Now that we are living in the 21st century people are worried about the negative effects that cars are contributting to. If we limit the use of cars it takes away stress from drivers, it reduces air pollution, and avoids many traffic jams we have on daily basis. Although, life can be hard without cars their are several other ways to get around without harming our enviornment. One option we should take into consideration is walking. A little excersise doesn't harm anyone so why is it that since we have cars no one really walks anymore. If the human population in 1812 walked so can we.

To add on, stress in one of the main things you get while driving. You're in constant fear of people crashing into you,running a red light,running out of gas in the middle of the highway/street. Thw whole concept of driving is stressful enough for me and I don't even drive yet. If we limit the use of cars in our community it reduces lot of unecassary stress. The first source talks about a German residency where cars aren't permitted and if you own a car you can choose to buy a space for it which costs $40,000. Vauban (German residency) is home to 5,500 residents and only a few on them own car. ""In this approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway."" The thought of having one main street where everyone can access all they need is a genius idea becuase it basically forces people to walk and it reduces the use of cars which lowers stress. We shouldn't stress about cars becuase owning a car isn't a right, it's a privelage.

""On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31)."" Source number two states that the reason why this did this Paris was because of intense smog.",0
"In the article the author tells that even though there is alot of dangerous challenges in exploring venus and that he is willing to face them challenges. In paragraph 2 the author starts out saying how venus is earth's twin and that venus is the closest planet to us in terms of density and size. In the body paragrpah i am going to talk about the challenges author states in the story about venus, NASA's asspects on venus and how we can deal with these problems.

In this paragrpah i am going to talk about the challenges author states in the story about venus,

NASA's asspects on venus and how we can deal with these problems. Some challenges the author says that venus is thowing at us is that venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide that is covering the planet. In paragraph the the author also states that venus is on average 800 degrees Fahrenheit, that is hotter than mars and mars is the closest planet to the sun. The author also states that the atmosherpic pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on earth. If the earth had that muh atmospheric pressure than there would be no one left on this planet because that is so much pressure that it can crush a submarine. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes to land on its surface. Next, i am going to talk about how NASA asspects on venus. Some thing that NASA is saying is that there only possible solution for how hot it is and how much pressure is in the air is that with these hostile conditions that venus shoudl allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 miles above the rolling Venusain landspace, with that venus would avoid the unfriendly group conditions by staying up and out of the way. The temperatures over the ground would still be 170 degrees fahrenheit, but the pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. These conditons are not easy, but thye are surviable for human's. Finnally i am gonna talk about how we can solve the high pressure and high temperature. The first way we can solve these conditions are if we started having people go and live on venus and took some other living organisms with them. The second way we could solve it is if we found away to connect venus to earth and that would take away all ot the problems.

I would have to agree more with NASA's ideas on how to solve the problems venus is dealing with. i agree with the author it is just i don't think his idea's will wokr as well. One day i think we will be able to live on Venus and have it connected to Earth. In this essay i told you about about the challenges author states in the story about venus, NASA's asspects on venus and how we can deal with these problems.",0
"Did you know that some cities in the world are car-free? Cities like Vauban, Paris, and Bogota  don't use cars. There are many advantages when it comes to limiting car usage. Less cars mean a decrease in air pollution, alternative transportation, and fewer traffic jams.

Due to a near-record pollution, Paris decided to partially ban driving to clear the pollutants in the air. Usually, Paris is more polluted than other European capitals. According to Reuters, ""Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe"" (Source 2 paragraph 16 lines 3-5). America's second largest source of emissions is transportation.

Bogota, Columbia started a car free campaign in the mid-1990s to promote alternative transportation. Millions of Columbians celebrated this day by either hiking, biking, skating, or riding the buses to work. Two other Columbian cities joined the event. This car free day gives people a chance to improve the city. ""...uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks..."" (Source 3 paragraph 28 lines 2-3).

Reducing the usage of cars also drastically cuts the amount of traffic jams. According to Andrew Selsky, ""...rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic..."" (Source 3 lines 30-31). Mimi Sheller says that ""The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing an dhas drawn empty nesters back in"" (Source 4 paragraph 35 lines 9-11).

The cities that have reduced car usage are making the planet a little better each day. Fewer traffic jams, decreases in the amount of pollutants, and alternative transportation can all happen if we decrease the amount of cars we use each day.",0
"Asking different people may lead to a better answer than just asking one person. Asking more people can help by getting then to say there opinion on the question your asking them so if you asked me what does 2+2 equal and i said 10 but if you asked another person the same question and they say it equals 4 you wold believe him because he is correct. You should also if you keep asking for people how to succeed youll get maybe a whole paragraph of advice but then that will help you if you keep viewing different perspectives of how people succeed in life.

Seeking multiple people for advice would make would be helpful sometimes but most of the time it is. Some good advice is that just keep on going or never stop trying because at the end there is going to be a reward and some of the bad one's would be stop trying you're never going to make it. You should as different people only f they gone trough and they have experience with it.

Another reason why you should ask multiple people for it is because some people maybe giving you the wrong advice so thats why it's helpful to ask other people that are similar to you because then they can give some some good advice that could be reliable to you. Reasons why you should ask more than person is because one persons advice could be like i was very passionate about my job and worked really hard to try to et it and i finally got the job and now the CEO of it. and the some bad one's is don't try to work because you can do what you love even tho you can do that but it can result of not a lot of money into your wallet but it sometimes will get you a lot of money and can afforrd what other people can afford.",0
"Is it good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age? For example, I got a academics scholarship into George Mason. With that scholarship I earned and worked so hard I could have a high chance of becoming a banker or someone who runs money and I been committing to this career from 8th grade. Knowing and committing to a career puts you on a very a head spot in life and also on what you want to become.

First off, having a head start of knowing what career you want in High School puts you on a spot that you're a head. People who don't know what careers they want, gives them a struggle because when you get to College or finish High School they would be in a position of not knowing what to do after. The stress will build up, over thinking, anxiety, give up, depression, and lastly the most important going to the wrong path. But people who know what career they want in High School will be ready for what college they should go to, what classes to take, after college they'll be applying to jobs, and lastly, doing something they always wanted to become or do since High School. For example, I have a friend who just turned 20, He always told me about what career he wanted to do and his plan after High School. A year ago, I asked him about his career and plan. He already has a job of what he wanted since High School but at the age of 19 and also told me he was thankful for staying with the career he always wanted and never gave up. He also told me, It wasn't easy to become what he wanted and no matter what if you want something, keep pushing and never give up because soon you'll be proud or yourself.

Secondly, The stress of committing a career from High School is less than not having one. People who already know what they want to become or do will have their challenges because it wont be easy to getting up there. For example, people who already know what they want will face tests, projects, public projects, quizzes, finals, and etc. But that's only what they have to face. For the people who don't know what they want to do, will start worrying about what they want to do, stressing over why they didn't think of a career in High School, over thinking, and etc. It's better if know what you want to become early than late because it could waste your time if you start late instead of starting early or on time.

Lastly, having to learn different careers is good, but it'll some times be confusing, over whelming, stress, anxiety, and etc. But just knowing one career you'll be able to focus on that specific career. Trying to push yourself passing those limits, making yourself you can do it, never giving up, and reaching your goal. Having to learn many careers is very good, because you know a lot and a high chance of getting many jobs. But learning and staying one career is better because you will know what to do in a mil of a second. People would want to hire you because how fast and hard worker you are. It's better to have a head start from everyone than being last.

Therefore, knowing and commting to one career puts you on a very good spot. For example having a head start, less stress involved, and lastly choosing you love since High School. Finally, these are the reasons why it is a good idea for students in High School to commit to a career at a young age. So what, are you going to commit to a career at a young age because time is clicking and soon it'll be too late. ",0
"Texting and Driving

I believe that you shouldn't be able to text while driving because you are putting yourself and others at danger because you are no longer aware of your surroundings and can steer anywhere while you aren't paying attention. I understand that there are some things that need attention, but it's not worth the lives of innocent people. Nearly about 400,000 people die from texting and driving. 1 out of 4 car accidents occur from texting and driving and that's truly a shame. The average text sent takes the drivers eyes off the road for about 5 seconds and that's enough time to get into a life threatening accident according to SafeWise. com. These deaths hurt people mentally and physically and usually cause depression due to the fact that they lost a loved one to a foolish person. Some people don't even pay attention to the rules put in to place by the law and are seen constantly on the phone with someone.

These people deserve to get their license suspended and maybe even revoked because these people have no empathy for people who actually want to make it to their destination safely. The phone calls and text messages can wait because they aren't worth someone's life and it sure isn't worth going to jail for. Just wait until you reach you reach your destination to do these things. Keep this nonsense of the roads. The roads were meant for you to drive on not to text on. I think we should have some type of scanner to see if there are any active phones in use and if there are police or some type of authority should be alerted. This should bring down the amount of deaths caused by texting and driving. This is also another way to prevent texting while driving.",0
"One topic that is frequently debated is ""Does true self-esteem come from praise or does it come from achievement"". Some people think, that praise that is given for deficient work undermines learning by lowering standards. They believe that the source of true self-esteem is achievement. I believe that the source of true self-esteem is by praising a student's work because that could help them grow more independent. By praising a student's work, they are going to be able to; work efficiently independent, have a bigger self confidence, and learn better.

First reason, When a student's work is praised that helps them achieve there work more efficiently. It emphasizes that they are capable of working independent and being able to have a good job. When some one is praised for their work, it makes them feel good and makes them want to do more work. A student's work should not get praised for their work if they didnt put any effort in the work because that would just make them want to not put any effort in the work, because they will think that they would get the same grade as someone that actually tried and actually wanted to get a good grade for something that they put so much effort into.

Second reason, When a student has a big self confidence that helps them get their work done more constant and with more effort because they know that they can do it and that are capable of having a good grade. when a student is willing to put a lot of effort into the work. their work should be more praised. praising a student's work can help them have a by self confidence, which can help the students learn more. when a student is willing to learn that is the true motivation that is considered being able to achieve more work and do it more efficiently and with more confidence.

Third reason, When a students is willing to learn a lot and are always on track, paying attention, and turning in work on time. and always putting a lot of effort in school, those kinds should always be recognized and praised, because they show how mature they are and how willing they are to graduate and have a good job. If a student is willing to learn and put a lot of effort in work, that makes them mature because it shows how willing they are to learn. other students dont care if they graduate or not because for them being ""popular"" and not listening to the teacher, and disrupting the class and doing what ever they want it more important than learning and getting an education.

Having a strong self confidence, being independent and willing to learn more are some examples of praising a student's work. when a teacher shows an appreciation to their students it shows that they care about them and it shows that they are willing to help them carry on and push them forward and being their when they need it, and that makes the students want to go to class everyday and want to learn because the teacher is fun and knows how to work with students very well. and that is why it is good to praise a student's work.

"Cars are one of the main causes of air pollution is the United States and the world. If everyone would limit their car usage, one would see all the great benefits of not using a car as much. Limiting car usage helps keep our planet clean and people would be a lot happier.

To begin with limiting car usage would help keep our plant clean. In the article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", the author, Duffer, states ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" After this ban was enforced Paris' air was cleared in a less than a week. This proves that one doesn't even have to limit their car usage a lot, even just a little bit helps. In the article, ""The End of Car Culture"", the author, Rosenthal, claims that Bill Ford, chairman of the Ford Motor Company, wants to create cities in which ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lowers emissions and improve safety."" This shows that even Bill Ford, the chairman of FORD MOTOR COMPANY, even agrees that limiting car usage would help lower global pollution.

On another hand, limiting car usage makes people a lot happier. In the article, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", the author, Rosenthal, states ""when i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two...."" A normal person, a person like everyone else, claims that they're happier without a car, less stressful, imagine what just limiting your car usage would do. In the article, ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", the author, Selsky, says ""'It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,' said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as her rode a twoseat bicycle with his wife."" This shows that limiting car usage for just a day, takes away stress and helps the planet. Wouldn't it be nice to have a stressfree day?

In conclusion, limiting car usage, even just a little, reduces pollution and causes happiness. One can help themselves, while also helping the planet.",0
"Yes seeking help from others can help you make better choices, for you can make new friends, make choosing much easier, and others who have gone through the same situation as you can help you make a good choice.

If you ask someone to help you make a choice it can lead to you making a new friend that you can depend on when you need it the most with any situation and give you advice that will help whenever you need it and make you a better person as well.

Also, asking for help from others can making choosing much easier since they have no bias opinion on what you should do and they could choose for you on what to do instead of you making a hard choice you do not have to worry about all that given that someone helped you make choosing easier.

You could ask for an opinion from someone who has been in the same situation as you and they could tell you which choice is the best choice to make that will make everyone happy and no conflict at all.

However, asking for advice from others can make it harder to choose, some people believe that some choices can end frienddhips, and sometimes advice from people who have gone through the same situation can give terrible advice and can lead to you making a bad descion and you regretting your descion.

In conclusion asking for advice from others can be very helpful because, you can make new friends,make choosing easier,and others who have gone through the same situation as you can help you make a good choice.",0
"Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm because to have success is important to do a great effort. It is very important in the life, but to learn the value that it has sometimes failure is also necessary. Also success is not something easy to get, but without loss calm could get it with enthusiasm. Success has an role important in the life of many people since it is something that is necessary in their academic level, their jobs, and their goals to have a better future.

First, success is difficult to get at the academic level, but the students need know that although they are failing with effort they could get it. Since to get it, they need to study a lot without loss the hope of getting success. Also they need to practice each step to do more easy their activities and have a better success. For example: if students loss any test they need to study and practice a lot to get their success with enthusiam. For this reason, the importance of the success also depend of failure to failure to learn.

Second, in the work, the success depend of many dedication and is absolutely necessary working a lot to get it. If the employees is not working well, the problem could be that the company not could have success and the employees could be exonerated of their jobs. Moreover, if they are exonerated their jobs, they need to looking for another jobs without loss the calm to get their new jobs with a great enthusiasm. For example: An employee was farawell for does not a good report, but continuous practicing and learned to do a good report after that the employee found a good job did a very nice job. Sometimes the success in the work is not easy to get, but neither impossible.

Finally, the people have many goals in their future, but also have obstacles to get success. The goals are difficul to accomplish, but not difficult to do. Furthermore, to realize their goals, they need to keep completely firm their ideas to find the success. Sometimes, they can failure, but they have the capacity to do anything and accomplishment their success for example, A family want to go to the beach, the problem is that they do not loss money to their vactions, yet they were to the beach because winning money working hard and with a great emotion they arrived to the beach. All goals can get with dedication and effort.

In conclusion, from failure to failure, the success can be possible and get it with a great enthusiasm. In the academic level, job and goals for future there are not impossible to accomplish the success. Does not matter the difficulty that everything have, the most important is realizing all with success, but without loss enthusiasm. Success is important, but the most important is learning to surpass failure to get it with enthusiasm. ",0
"DO YOU HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THE PRESIDENTIAL VOTE?

At long on the History, There's strange and curios case in the story of the political, especialy in United State of America (U.S.A) The political allways had serius problems, like corruption, the confusion of what president choose, the bad counting vote, etc. But with all those problems that happens in the world.. How United States choose good presidents? First, we are going to talk about the curius case in the U.S.A talking about the political and how U.S.A choose the future president.

There's alot of curios case in the U.S.A. For example, it's said clearly in the article that for first time in the story of U.S.A there's 2 represents to be president that came from the state of Hawaii in 1960, and those represent was against Jhon F. Kennedy. Or the other case that the Electoral system in those times it was very confused and for each state it represents 1 vote so The legendary John Kerry wins 34 democratics votes. There was alot of controversy.

But with all those problems, how those U.S.A choose good there presidents? The goverment like there citizen have clearly 5 things (according the article wrote by Richard A. Posner) That are: ''Certainty of Outcome'' That is selecting a president that ougth to be who most votes receives is the winner. ''Everyone's President'' Means that is a resulr by a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president.''Swing State'' Is a method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates.''Big States'' Is a large state that gets more attention from presidentail candidates in a campaign than small state does.. And the last one is ''Avoid Run'off Elections'' That it could be argued method selecting the president may turn off by potential voters.

In my opinion, i'm pro with. Is a very nice Goverment and Can helps every country in the world becouse there potential economic that they have.",0
"Everyone shows emotion at some point in their lives. Whether it be joy, sorrow, or even anger everyone has expressed their emotions in one way or another. Now there is a computer software that can recognize six emotions. Reading the emotional expressions of students in a classroom using this technology is valuable because it could tell the instructor when a student is confused, it could modify the lesson, and it could help people feel more empathy for each other.

Students can become confused very quickly when an instructor is teaching about something. This computer software could stop this from happening and overall help students have a better experience at school when trying to learn. In paragraph six Dr. Huang talks about how this could revolutionize a classroom, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This would overall help a teacher know when someone is confused so they can help them after class or talk to them more in-depth about the lesson. This invention could hep out many of students that find lessons to be very hard and don't know how to do whatever the instructor is teaching. This software could also modify the lesson that an instructor is teaching so that it is easier for a student to grasp.

Many teachers present day don't necessarily care if the students are learning what they are teaching, but just the fact that they are teaching it gives them a clear concious. This computer program could give the teachers an alert saying that someone isn't getting the lesson because they are confused with a certain topic that the teacher talked about during the class. They could then modify their lesson so that it is easier for everyone to learn. An example of evidence from the text of this is when Dr. Huang talks about how using this technology teachers could modify their lesson so that it would be easier for their students to learn, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This helps point to the fact that it could help everyday teachers know when their students aren't completely grasping the lesson that they are teaching. This technology could also help people have more empathy for each other.

People present day are always talking about how nobody has any empathy for each other. This software could fix this especially in the classroom. A student would know when their fellow student would be sad and they would be able to talk to them and help them overcome the sadness. Another reason empathy may happen would because we unconciously imitate other people's facial expressions. Here is a quote from this article where the author, Nick D'Alto is talking about how this technology could cause empathy, ""Empathy may happen because we unconciously imitate another person's facial expressions."" This would help people show more empathy for each other. Overall this would be a great addition to the classroom.

Having this software in a classroom setting would stop students from becoming confused from a lesson, help modify the lesson so that an instructor could make the lesson more understandable for students, and give people more empathy. These reason give evidence that having this computer software in a classroom would not only benefit the students but benefit the teachers as well by giving them that peace of mind that their students get the lesson that they are teaching.",0
"What is the Electoral College? The Electoral College is a process ,not a place. The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between elections of the President by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. In the United States people select a president every three years. They would either select their president by Electoral College, or by the most popular vote.

Voting by Electoral College is not safe at all,they should change it to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. When you vote by electoral vote it is never guaranteed that they are going to vote for who you wanted to vote for. They might even change their mind at the last second ,so you never know what they are about to do. Some rich people can pay them to buy off their votes. Then ,boom you lost a vote it might result to a tie or lost. According to paragraph 11 ""In the same vein,""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast and deciding vote for whomeverthey please..."". You never what could happen ,it is like taking a very riskfull risk and every votes matter.Just one vote can make a very big difference. Further more,voting by popular vote would give you a better chance of getting your candidate to win.When you are the one that elects the President you feel more confident and good.You'll know that you voted for the one you wanted to win and the one that you think that will change everything the way you wanted to. Also ,you don't have worry about anything else ,like people going in the voting box and taking the votes out. Once you vote ,your vote is immediately safe.

In the other hand,voting by Electoral College benefited us.Obama which is the current president of the United States wouldn't probably be president if it wasn't for them. according to the last article ""In 2012's election ,for example ,Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and rodney...."" That means their votes helped Obama win. also the Electoral College avoids problem of elections in which no candidates recieves a majority of the votes cast. Winners take all methods in awarding electoral votes for what they've done.

To summarise my reasonnings Electoral College votes should be change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Peoples should be allowed to vote on their own. Everybody would be much happier.Without happy people the country would be upside down.",0
"Think of a clear world, no smog, no pollution, just a beautiful day everyday. Now wouldn't that be nice. What if I told you that you can make it happen? It's as easy as snapping your fingers. This thing you have to do is, drum roll please..... not using your car. I know it sounds crazy right now but let me tell you about all the good that comes out of it, and maybe, just maybe you'll change your mind.

Now as most of you know there is alot of pollution all over Earth, and this pollution is caused by alot of things, but the two main reasons are cars and power plants. Pollution caused by cars affects alot of things including greenhouses. When smoke from a car reaches a greenhouse it produces a gas that negativly affects the enviroment. Your probably thinking that it's no big deal because ""theres not alot of greenhouses"", but that's where your wrong. As Elisabeth Rosaenthal says "" Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"".

Another thing that is caused by cars is smog. Robert Duffer, the writer of

Paris bans driving due to smog , wrote that "" Paris typically has more smog than other European capital ...[Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found"". Congestion in France was down 60 percent after almost a week of intensifying smog. They had to stop using cars of course, but it was the only way to get the smog to go down.

Now that we've talked about the bad stuff caused by cars, let's talk about the good that can come out of not using a car as much or not at all. alot of people who participate in not using a car, weather it was for a day or for forever, have said that it reduces alot of stress and air pollution. Lower air pollution makes for more clean and clear air. Which means you get to see the day better than before, and who wouldn't want that. Overall it not only helps you, but it also helps the planet you live on, so give walking a try, you might even find seeing nature around you better than driving by it.",0
"The author supports his arguement quite effectively, though not without any flaws. The author effectively lists off the benefits of exploring Venus, and proper proposals for doing so, however the complexity and unrealistic assumptions of the solutions as well as the negative descripton of Venus take away from its point rather than benefiting it.

The effective conveying of benefits helps to support its idea of risking danger for the reward of landing. The author describes how Venus is relatable with earth which creates a connection between the reader and Venus, as well as creating a mood of hospitality and familiarity. It also states that because Venus is the ""nearest option for a planetary visit"", it is a benefit to inhabit Venus first. This persuasion effectivly uses logos to show the audience logical reasoning for why the scientists should endevour to research Venus.

The author's proposals for ways to accomplish these tasks help to build ethos in the writing, as it shows that the author knows about the information that is displayed. The introduction of NASA also builds up this ethos, as to bring the audience to better trust in the author. The examples of proposals also provide evidence for how such ideas could be accomplished, such as the ideas of ""systems that use mechanical parts"" and therefore add to the logos of the paragraph, as the author logically explains why the proposals would be beneficial.

However in contrast with the effective support of the main idea, the author also convey's information and techniques that oppose his idea. Firstly, the author makes assumptions about how much technology would have advanced, and because his proposal for a ""blimp-like vehicle"" is so technologically advanced and seems outlansish, the mood created for the audience is incredulous and skeptical. This does not benefit the writer's ideas because of the audiences mood, and therefore the author loses the audiences trust in proper solutions.

Also negatively impacting the main idea are his descriptions of Venus. This is because the author uses a lot of evidence to support how dangerous Venus is, in direct contrast to what he should be supporting. Because of the logos used to show how dangerous Venus is, like how it has ""temperatures average over 800 degrees"" the audience is put into a mood of impossibility and doubt. Because of the mood of the audience, the audience is also less likely to understand why Venus could be beneficial if the landscape is so terribly trecherous.

In conclusion, the writer does a fairly effective job at expressing is ideas, in his building of ethos and pathos that help to support why Venus is so amazing, and how to explore it, however fails by accidently creating a mood of unbelievablity, and therefore losing the audience to the uncertain nature of the situation. If the author had attempted to create a mood that was more beneficial to persuading the audience, the passage would have been extremely effective in persuading the audience of his thesis.",0
"If someone wishes to travel somewhere, such as a normal commute, probably the first transportation method they think of is a car. Cars are everywhere. They're the things hiding in a home, waiting for someone to enter the depths of the dark garage. Unless the garage is truly empty of the worldkilling machine, such as in Vauban, Germany where people have done the unthinkable: got rid off cars.

Though it may sound preposterous, or even critically insane to even consider giving up a car, the citizens of Vauban are a lot happier to be rid of the burden. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" Rosenthal, In German Suburb, Life goes On Without Cars. As you may have forgotten, car payments, maintenance, check up, oil changes, and gas are all part of owning a car which may be a financial strain for most.

Again, those robots that you move with pedals and a steering wheel are seriously affecting our Earth. We're Earth murderers. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States"" Rosenthal, In German Suburb, Life goes On Without Cars. Fellow humans, we are not the only species on planet Earth. We are so used to cars it's like watching something interesting on TV and trying to pull away from it it's nearly impossible. ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clean the air of the global city"" Duffer, Paris bans driving due to smog. Less driving cars is less greenhouse gasses that destroy our Earth.

In our society today, cars are the dominant transportation method. When you go outside in today's world it is most likely not the sound of nature, but a manmade vehicle. Without cars, a whole new world will come forth, or most likely the beautiful world we forgot about that is mercilessly trapped beneath unessesary layers of greenhouse gases. When Paris banned cars, it improved the pollution stuck in the air. ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French part to recind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday"" Duffer, Paris bans driving due to smog. If we stop driving cars, it will help most people financially, help our Earth, and ease the worry and stress over the maintenance of a car. Once again, we are not the only species on Earth.",0
"Have you ever thought its time for change? Germany, New York , Columbia , and the United states are trying to reduce cars driven. Many benifits are coming from the downfall of cars being driven. Less stress, no smog from pollution, and less money spent on expensive cars.

Vauban's streets are completely car free. Heidrun Walter says she is less tense and much happier without a car. Walking, bycicling, and hyking are much more eco friendly. In 2006 a trend is growing in Europe. Vauban home to 5,500 residents may be the most expieriment in low car suburban life. Car ownership is allowed but there are few places to park large garages and the edge of development. 70 percent do not own cars and 57 percent sold cars to move to Vauban.

Car pollution is at its all time high, in paris motorists were ordered to leave their cars at home due to smog. 67 percent of vehicles in France use diesel fuel. Only 53.3 percent make up the rest of western europe. passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of green house gases, and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the united states. Chicago to Shanghai people tend to make their homes which is a huge reduce of green house gas emissions from tailpipes.

Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as the years pass. Americas love for vehicles seems to be coolig down. The number of miles driven dropped in 2005 and continued droppimg steadily. In 2013 the number of miles driven was nearly 9 percent below its peak. If this persists there will be beneficialimplications for carbon emissions and the enviroment. Last year a study was found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009.

This is why life today would be fantastic and more benifitcial with car free cities and more walking, bycicling and hyking. less stress, less pollution, and less money spent on cars. As days continue the percentage of cars and miles driven decreases drastically.",0
"The electoral college is a process,not a place. are founding fathers established it so that congress and election of the president by popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral college consists of the selection of the electors where they vote for the president vice president an the counting of the electoral votes by congress. thew number of electoral college consists of 538 electors. majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. Why do the state of senator wish to take away electoral college votes? because they think there is to much voting bc under the electoral college system voters vote not just for the president but for a slate of electors who in turn elect the president. but who pick the electors? who are the electors? the electors can be anyone that not holding public officean they pick the electors by the state. that how voters sometimes get confused about electors and vote. But the outcome of all this is that electoral college vite is possible an its less likely to dispute over the popular vote. A electoral vote is possible because the total number of vites is 538 is an even number. So to rap it all up it can be argued that the electoral collge method of selecting the president may turn off pontenial voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying for their state. voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. so state senator i think we should keep the electoral college.",0
"BOOM! CRASH! BANG! ""911, what's your emergency?"" ""HELP! we've been in a terrible accident, please get here fast!""Sirens and horns is what you hear after a terrible car crash. By limiting car usage, we could prevent less car accidentstraffic jams, pollutiongreenhouse gas and we can get more exercise.

To begin with, pollution and the greenhouse effect are really bad to the environment. Car exhaust and other gases are a big contributor to that. How do we do something to help that people ask? Well you can drive less and maybe walk or ride a bike. It will limit so many big issues if you just dont drive as much. Source 3, paragraph 24 business man, Carlos Arturo Plaza says ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" You know what he did after he said that? He rode away in a 2 seater bike with his wife. Thats a business man, and even he doesn't have a problem riding his bike to work with his wife. You can do so much to save the earth. You, can make a difference. You don't have to be the hero, but you can sure do your part to help save the day.

In comparison, car accidents? They are the absolute worst. It not only affects 1 car but it could affect 2 or 3. Maybe even more. Limiting car usage could prevent so many accidents and that means no more hospital visits. Source 2, paragraph 4 says ""congestion was down 60% in the capital of Frnce after 5 days of intensifying smog."" That means that there was 60 percent less traffic jams and accidents in 5 days! That's an amazing improvement. I always wished that people couldn't get hurt or that I could save someones life, so that what I will try to do. Drive less, or drive only when it's needed. Don't leve your car running. A big negative is don't speed and watch all around you. You can prevent killing someone, not just that, but you can decrease the amount of accidents that can happen. Don't make an asamine choice and drive because you feel like it. Help save this earth. It's really all we have left.

Lastly, you can get more exercise. Riding a bike and walking is a great source of exercising. Everyone always talks about how obesity is a big problem well this can decrease the amount of body weight you have and you wont put gases into the air. That's 2 problems solved in 1. There are so many things you can do to solve this issue and these are only a few. I see a lot of people riding bikes or walking to school. Teachers especially which shows you that they arent always asking teenagers or new drivers to do it. Don't be the reason the earth is getting worse. Be the reason its getting better.

In conclusion, pollution is bad and so are accidents. But there is always a soulution to the madness. You yourself can make a change. This earth can't take care of itself, it needs your help, so help it. Limiting the usage of your car is a great start. Yes, cars are great and they get you from point A to point B and they can warm you up when it's cool outside or cool you down when its hot, those are all true statements and that's fine it really is. Just limit it and things will start to get a lot better, trust me. It all starts with one person willing to make a change and that person can be you.",0
"I remember when I was younger, I used to think that I could solve every problem myself. I was wrong. People always think they know best, but this is seldom true. Everyone you see walking past has faced their own set of unique challenges, and consequently each person holds a knowledge that could prove beneficial to you. Seeking advice from more than one person can help someone make a better choice, because it allows the person to consider other's experiences, perspectives, and enables them to make a less biased, more sensible decision.

Listening to the experiences of others is critical when it comes to making a good choice. Ask for advice from someone who is older and wiser. Someone with additional life experience. While it may sound cliche, your elders do have valuable lessons to share. Additionally, this life experience could include bad decisions that they, themselves, have made in the past. Learning from the mistakes of those around you is a foolproof way to avoid making a poor choice yourself. Likewise, other people may have been in a similar situation before. If another person has been faced with the same decision, or one that is related to your own, that person will, certainly, be happy to tell you what worked, or did not work, for them. Taking into account the experiences of others increases the likelihood of making a choice that leads to your success.

In addition to life experience, everyone has a different perspective. These varying point of views could allow a person to see their own situation differently. Being able to look at the issue in a new light is, undoubtedly, one of the most important factors in deciding what to do. Moreover, another person might see a solution you did not think of. Putting multiple minds together makes it far easier to solve tough challenges in life. Lastly, in a way, hearing other's perspectives provides you the ability to observe your own life in the third person. Almost as if you have exited your body and can now see what everyone else is able to see. This new vision is useful in preventing you from making a choice that you will later regret. When you consult with others, you are sure to see something you did not consider beforehand.

The experiences and perspectives of other people help you to remain impartial and sensible when it comes to decision-making. In times of stress, people have a tendency to get wrapped up and consumed in their own heads. If you have someone to calm you down, you are far more likely to not make a rash, emotional decision. Furthermore, people are often biased of their own point of view. If you do not go to multiple sources, you may end up making a choice that is unfair to others, or unfair to yourself. Lastly, seeking other people's opinions gives you opportunity to effectively weigh the pros and cons of your options. Each person has something of their own to offer, and it is crucial that you hear the voices of others when making an honest choice. All in all, listening to multiple opinions on a matter allow a person to stay logical and fair when faced with a difficult choice.

All things considered, seeking advice form multiple sources is necessary if you wish to make a well-informed decision. The experiences and point of views of those around you are crucial in staying fair and not getting clouded by your own judgment. Ultimately, those three things that you can gain from listening to what other people have to say, are what is going to stop you from doing something irrational. If you refrain from asking for advice, or only ask one person, you could be missing out on obtaining information that could keep you from doing something you will regret.",0
"I will always remember the first time I walk outside to enjoy the outdoors view. I could see the nice green grass moving side to side, smell the fresh air, and see the pretty nice tall green trees giving a nice long shadow to the ground. I can tell people were having a lot of fun by their smiles on their face, and by running up and down the field. I can see people are having fun it made me want to have fun too. I remember the first time I went to the Community Park, then I went to the State Park, and also I went to the National Park.

The first reason, is when I went to the the Community Park for the first time. I could see this big blue, and yellow playground. Also I could see people running up and down at the Community Park having so much of fun. There was also other people playing tag with other people at the park. Lastly, the Community Park had so many fun equipment to play. Like the swing, slides, wall climbers and the monkey bars. There were a lot of people there so we had to wait for our turn to use every equipment they had at the Community Park.

Second reason, is when I went to the State Park for the first time too. I could remember walking under the trees with a nice wind blow to my face in a nice shadow made by the trees. Also I kept walking and I saw a lot of animals that were not attacking people. Animals that I saw were Frogs, Turtle, Fish, Lobsters, Birds, Snakes, Deer, and Ducks all over the park. Lastly, I saw their was a big river where people were fishing. Then Other people were swimming in the river water because it was a very hot day outside at the park.

Last reason, is when I went to the National Park for the first time also. The park has a lot of fun things that we can go look at and visit animals at the park. The animals they can go and visit are Monkeys, Snakes, Giraffes, Turtles, Tigers, Pandas, Birds, Frogs, Crocodiles, Gorillas, Sea Lions, Donkeys, Horses, Lions, Lizards, Iguana, and Elephants. Lastly, the National Park has food stands were we can go and buy food if we get hungry at anytime. We can take brakes if we get tired of walking in the National Park and sit down.

In conclusion, enjoying the outdoors is very fun because we can go and visit a lot of different Parks. I will never forget the first time I went to the Community Park, State Park, and the National Park because it's a very fun way to enjoy the outdoors day. I will never forget playing at the Community Park playground that day. I will never forget walking at the State Park river that day. Lastly, I will never forget looking at does pretty animals at the National Park that day.",0
"Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky and the closest in distance as well. However, the Venus has proved a very challenging place to explore or to examine more closely. In this exploring process, it will has a variety of stumbling blocks to make scientists stop to explore it. But actually, striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. So that's why people studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

Here're some evidences regarding why the people still to explore it. For instance: Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation ( Paragraph 8). According to this evidence of the article, I can see innovation can help people discover more meaningful things and make country's development gradually more flourishing than before. "" NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus."" "" The thought of computers existing in those days may sound shocking, but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all."" ( Paragraph 7) From those evidences, I know they've met important problems to solve when they were exploring Venus, but they still work on this project and try to use different ways or technology to solve those difficulties in not good conditions.

All above, despite the danger presents, we can use imagination or innovation methods to create and explore new works of our life, because that not only is able to help us improve our technology skills and the Venus is a valuable science achievement but also it desveres to explore the Venus. So that's why the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.",0
"Fellow citizens there have been an abudnce of incidents that  has happen that involved cars. I prepaired this statement from evidence of these incidents. Nowadays people rely to heavily on cars. dont confuse this statement as me want to eliminate cars .i jus suggest we limit them to a more mangable amount of vehicals. cars can be very reliable but the amount of deaths and car accidents. coupled with the gases cars give off to the ozone layer. limiting them can do so much good and save alot of nations alot of money.

VAUBAN streets are completely  car-free. there is a car ownership allowed but only can at large garages. at the border of the complex where only a vehicale owner can buy  a space for 40,000 witch includes a home. as result in this mass vehical rebiltaion 70 percent of vaubans popluation does not own vehiclas although 57  percent own  sold there vehicals to start move there",0
"Phones and Driving

Should a person text and drive?

Really don't you think its all up to them because I don't. I don't think you should always do it or always have to the need to use your phone while thing is happening around you. Imaging going 65 mph and your jus on the phone playing candy crush. What the chances of something wrong happening. A LOT

Driving is dangerous for those who don't really know a lot About it. You have to be sharp on the look about. What if a kid runs out to get his ball and you don't pay attention because you were on the phone? That would be devastating for your and the kid's family, having to act like you really wasn't on the phone lying that you didn't see him. All because they were on to phone and couldn't wait till, they were at a full stop to check it.

I think that's the only time you can check your phone, and I'm not talking about checking your whole social media accounts. I mean just making sure no one texted you or missed an important call. If you do pull in anywhere and check, if its that important you wouldn't put anyone else's life in danger. Its all safe or not safe at all and I don't care how long you've been driving anything can't happen to anyone. You can't de greedy and pick yourselves over a kid or young person who might have had something great happening.

Its never okay to check your phone while moving your vehicle. A lot of people lose their life's and others because there being irresponsible and just can't leave there phone alone. I hate driving and seeing someone texting like put it down before you run into me. Also, there are so many injury's and deaths because of it. There are almost 390,000 injury's each year and one out of fours car accidents are based on texting and driving.

Should a person text and drive? Really don't you think its all up to them because I don't. those are the reasons why I wouldn't want no one texting and driving its dangerous, and immature. I think everyone should just listen to the rules. Especially if you think about it, a law that could save your life or anyone else on the road. I think people shouldn't text and drive.",0
"Many times during online activites, students can become confused or just simply bored. They often need their teacher to come and explain the topic to them because the online course or activity just simply isn't helping them in a way that works for them. The Facial Action Coding System would be beneficial to both the students and the teachers in schools. This technology can enable online programs to be modified to the students needs, whether they're lost or just uninterested, and it can help the children more efficiently when the teacher has their hands full. The Facial Action Coding System would be an overall help to struggling students and teachers everywhere.

Bored students are never a good thing. No student looks at a boring assignment and thinks, ""Wow, I really want to do this assignment for the next hour."" A bored student leads to an unmotivated student who isn't trying very hard, and there is nothing more boring than staring at a screen for some period of time doing homework. In the sixth paragraph of the article it states that this technology could recognize when a student is becoming bored and modify the lesson like a real human instructor. This could keep students engaged and interested in the lesson. They would be more willing to complpete their work than if the lesson were monotonous. The Facial Action Coding System could eliminate bored students everywhere.

Teachers in public schools can have up to 40 students in one class and they can't help all of them at once. Teachers are human, they can't be in two places at once or helping two students at once. With the Facial Action Coding System, computers can modify their lesson and teaching to specific students and give them the help that they need to understand the standards. All students don't learn the same way and all teachers cannot possibly have time to help each and every one of their students individually. This technology can make studies a little bit easier for everyone, even the adults.

This technology would be very valuable in schools, especially in the times we're currently living in. Almost everything is online nowadays. Classes that taught how to write in cursive are being replaced with classes that teach how to type correctly on a keyboard. In many schools you will find children carrying around laptops instead of textbooks. You can even take college courses online. Why wouldn't you want to make the online learning experience even better by allowing the computers to customize themselves to the specific student?

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System would vastly improve the educational experience of students all around the world. If a student were confused or bored, the computer would adjust itself to keep the student understanding and engaged in the lesson. The computers would be able to provide just as good of help as the teacher would, thereby lessening the workload of the teacher and making sure the students are still getting all the explanations and teaching they need. Technology is everywhere, in almost every classroom. Improving the way it works would be improving our student's education and in time, their futures.",0
"If schools offers students distance learning as an option, that student should take the offer. That's my opinion if a school ever offer me online school. If I would have chosen this offer, I would have 3 reason why I agree that offer. Student should always think first if a school offers you something.

My first reason is, student can take their time in the morning to wake up and take a shower. For example, if a student wakes up late to school, that student wouldn't have time to do stuff he/she planned in the morning. But online school, that student can wake up late and take their time what he/she planned in the morning. My second reason is that its less cheaper. In online school, students only need: a computer, notebook, and something to write with. Students also receive free food from their home. But in regular school, some student pay money to get food, and the supplies for each class can be expensive. My last reason is student sometime finish their online school early, and have the rest of the day to play games, or hang out with friends.

In conclusion, student should always pick the right decision, when it comes to a offer in school. I think online school is good for students. Why, because if a student that is having family problems, and missing school every day. They can take online school, so they don't fail a grade, or miss any important assignment.",0
"Dear senator,

Today in class, we were discussing if we should keep the process of the Electoral College. Now this got me thinking,why should we keep the Electoral College? Well,since there are more pros than cons i'll go with the cons. Firstly,the Electoral College is unfair and secondly it is a non democratic way of selecting a president.

Well,where do i start! The winner take all system is definetly unfair. Because of this system, most canididates won't spend any time at all in a state that they know they have no chance at winning in. People in South Carolina said that they never even saw a capaign ad for the canididates;or for that matter the canididates themselves.

The Electoral College is by far a democratic way of selecting a president. For example,when you go to the assigned palce to vote in your area,you vote for a slate of electors. See, its the electors who vote for the president not the people. How in any way is that democratic? And, have you ever brought to thought the possibility that the winner of the electoral vote will not achieve the national popular vote. It happened in 2000 what's stopping it from happening now?

We should not keep the process of the Electoral College. The winner take all approach is just a crumb from this totally unfair and biased system. And,this system is galaxies away from being democratic in any way. So,how about we give the people what they deserve by terminating the Electoral College.",0
"The computer software is in schools would be a great thing for many different resons. The software could help the kids become more in volved in lerning,

It can release some stress on kids, and it can help its over all better grades within the class. The computer software can help people not just students in many ways.

First the computer software can help kids stay more interactive within school and help them stay focast at there task. with this software the computer can tell if you are getting board or unhappy, it will try and swtch things up to keep that student more ingaed in there work. This would make students enjoy learning and make them more focased at there work.

Another way the software can help is better grades when a student is more involved in school and enjoys learnign becaseu of how it is being taught will help grades rise. like it says in paragraf 6 ,""then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" this showing that they can help students get more out of thre learning. meaning better schools to choose from when it comes of time. when your grades go up then your gpa then you will hopfully fined a good school when it comes of time. and this software can help you bring up your grades becaseu it hellps yoiu enjoy school more and teaches you in differnt ways that you like better then when you have a teacher and helps you get the best out of what you have learned. When you understand it releases stress and then you day is better.

A third thing this software can do is not just for students what about for people who sit at a office or what about people who work with computers this software can help them be more profincent and help them do better at there job and can help them get payed for somthing they like and do somthing that they would want to do. They would have a better emotion threw out there day.

All in all the software can be very usefull for students and people to make there days a lot better and have better emotions threwout there day and improve there days in all and this software is a great thing that should be implomented in everyday life to help everyone have better emotions.",0
"You know what i do agree on what this article is saying why because people tend to use their cars all the time and yea what if we live far from town ok thats fine but i see people in my naighborhood driving two streets down just to hang out with there friends when one could simply just i mean put it this way if we were to drive less we would limit accidents , tickets, and polution so come with me as i explain my ideas.

You might ask your self how would this limit accidents well say you were driving one night to your best friend jeffs house and jeff lives three streets but you wanted to get there faster and the car on the oppisite lane the driver falls asleep and all of a sudden boom!! you dont know what just happen think about you could of been dead right in that instant but if you would of walked no accident you could of dodged the car.

Tickets and people might say "" man, police be racist pulling me over for know reason and now i have to pay a fine and go to court"" no buddy you were pulled over because you were being stupid on the road trying to act cool in front of your friend but see maybe if you where riding a bike or walking you probaly would of never got pulled over and  wouldnt have to pay a fine.

Less polution polution is really bad in alot of countries i mean its so bad that its kind of hard to breathe i mean it would suck if yoy were on vacation in the carrabians trying to enjoy a nice tropical day outside but you can't why because you can bearly breathe with all that polluted air around so yea.

I mean its not hard to ride a bike or to get a electric scooter or a moped or walk it benefits you and our earth i mean i agree with driving just to places you need to go like traval or grocrey shopping not to race act dumb or black smoke people i we made a don't drive your car week it would really benefit our earth alot.",0
"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

In the article, the author state that Venus has dangerous conditions for human life to explore. ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" Even though Venus has harsh conditions, there are still interesting facts about the planet that astronomers want to look more into. ""Astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may as well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life.""

In Paragraph 7 the author explains how sceintist are trying to make other approaches to studying Venus. ""Some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" Even though Venus is dangerous, this pushes scientist to innovate more to make their exploration successful and it will be effective on other planet explorations.",0
"imagine a world, twenety or so yeears from now, completely free of any nature. there is not a single tree, bush, flower or even a blade of grass to be found. only concrete roads and dirt everywhere, along with our cars driving on them. in the cars are us, fat lazy peoplle sitting in our cars, irritated and hollering out profanity at the mile long row of traffic as we try to get ot work. the cause of all this is toxic gases emited by our cars. this is our future. do we really want this to happen to us and ouur beautiful planet earth? i know i don't, and thats why all around the world, cities and even entire countires are doing something about it, they are working on cutting back peoples' vehicle usage, or even eliminnating it. without the cars, there would be a drastic decrease in polution, peoples' physical health would improve, and no more stress.

we all use cars, it has become a daily thing for all of us. we have become so acustomed to driving that we don't even think about it. we never thought about just how much damage our cars were doing on our home, planet earth. cars are the leading source of polution, everyday the polution is ripping awway at our ozone layer, slowly dooming us all and we are definnatly feeling the heat from it. places such as Vauban, Germany, have given up cars completely. in this experimental district, street parking, driveways and home garages are forbiden and, except for the main thoroughfare, the streets are commpletely car free. thanks to this, greenhouse gases in this area have gone down. residents of this town don't even seem to mind the car free life, they even enjoy it. having clean air makes this district a beautiful placce to live in.

not havinf motor vehicles also can immprove physical health. humans, especially Americans, have become incredably lazy, and as a result, incredably fat. no one has time in their busy schedual to excersize. everyone is too busy with work, school, kids, chores, or anythinng else. but, if we all got rid of cars and people either walked to and from their destinations, we would all be losing weight, be more aactive and be so muuch helthier. also, the helthier you are, the longer you live, so getting rid of cars will increase your life span!

having a car can also mean having a lot of stress. theres traffic backing you up making you an hour late for work, high gas prices sucking all the money out nof your wallets, expensive repair prices, and you are always putting your life at risk if you get into an accident. all this to think about while your just trying to get from point A to point B can be very stress full. but if everyone walked or biked to and from wherever, there would be much less traffic, no need for gas, the only repairs you would have to get is pumping more air in your tires, the onnly accident you might have is runninng your bike into another's bike and as long as you wear the right protectionn gear, you are very safe.

all of these factors add up to a safer, cleaner, helthier environment. if we all start now to eliminate cars, theworld would bbe a much bbetter pllace.",0
"Dear Senator,

Good day, I am writing this letter to let you know it's time for things to change. I have been reading and researching the Electoral College and i have a strong opinion on it. As you know, the Electoral College is a process when all five hundred and thirty eight electors vote on electors and defenders. This way of voting for electors lets the people have no say in whose running our goverment! Our goverment should not allow or be based on ""the winner takes all"" method. When we choose for OUR president we should be able to choose OUR electors too! Under the 23rd amendment of the constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the electoral college. The electors shouldnt be chosen by the canidate's political party, we should choose. By voting for a president every four years a new party of electors have already been selected to run with him and we dont get any say. After the presidential election, your governer creates a list of all the canidates that ran for president in your state with a list of their representative electors. This is later sent to Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

Richard Nixon, Bob Dole, Jimmy Carter, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all agree that we need to remove and forget about the electoral college. This year our voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could lose the presidency. Still the electoral college still has defenders fror themselves is crazy. Facts say voters arent actually voting for the president, but for a group of electors who in turn elect the president, and that is ridiculous. How are we supposed to trust these electors if we dont even know who they are and their background until after the election? Who even are these electors i wondered. I figured out that all the electors are actually anyone with a brain and not holding a public office, fantastic. So how do i know they are reliable and going to do whats best for my state and our country? Voters dont even control whom their electors vote for most of the time which is kind of scary. Some electors are even faithless in their party's canidate so they dont even vote for them at all! How can we rely on a group of people who dont rely on their party?

As much as I hate to say it, there most definitley is an upside to the Electoral College. The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that needs to be overruled by declaring the canidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. I personally think that is the best way to decide who gets in. Each party selects a slate of electors that are trusted to vote for the party's nominee. Sometimes the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Another reason The Electoral College is a positive way of voting is how certain the outcome is. There is never failure in the counting of the votes and there us rarely a tie between two people. My favorite reason is because ""everybody is president"". This means everybody can make their own decisions and have a great amount of freedom.

Even though im all for removing the Electoral College there is positives too. In a few years when i am able to vote, i will be careful of who I vote for and make sure that there is great electors in the party i vote for.",0
"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" tries to explain the several complications of sending a mission to Venus. They provide tons of factual evidence about the geography and climate of Venus. They give many good points, but ultimately fail at their task to convince readers that Venus exploration is worth it. Along with a failed point, this author tends to go off on side-tangents that have minimal importance to the story.

""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is an article about the positives and negatives of trying to land a spacecraft on Venus. He has a decent build-up into his first point while giving more and more small facts about our second planet. Venus is likely the most similar planet to Earth, with its rocky surface, hills, and mountains, but it has much more limiting factors to deter us from traveling there. It has terrible weather in comparison to Earth, with acidic carbon dioxide filling 97% of the atmosphere and with heats of 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The authors gives plenty of information about this planet, most of it relevant to the topic at hand, and therefore succeeds in teaching you about Venus.

Even after succeeding in information given, the author fails to promote the idea that travel to Venus is worth all the cons. They write about NASA wanting to know as much as possible about one of our closest neighbors, but don't give enough reasons as to why it's worth it. With acidic atmospheres ripping through machinery, technologies don't stand a chance on the Venusian surface. With the science that we have, the most we can hope for is a jet-like expirience, flying several miles above surface so that the pressure doesn't crush us instantly. Venus is additionally prone to constant volcanoes, earthquakes, and storms deadly enough to take out machinery. Given all this information, it seems like the author is trying to deter us from missions to Venus instead of promoting it, as they planned.

The final point to take into consideration when reading this article is the authors' side-tangents. Multiple times, the author delves into a side-topic as opposed to continuing on with the topic of Venus exploration. They start off the article with two sentences that have no relation to the story, yet confuse readers. The sentences are about Venus' nickname, the ""Evening Star"", and how even though it is a planet, it is still called this. This is completely irrelevant to exploration, as everyone knows it is a planet, and the ""Evening Star"" name is never mentioned again. Later on in the passage, the author rambles on about World War II-age computers and how they functioned properly even before the digital age. Once more, this is slightly irrelevant and does not contribute to the story at all except to add another paragraph instead of focusing on the specifics of how NASA is using them to help with Venus.

Overall, this article about Venus is less than ""stellar"". The author attempts to prove why Venus missions are a neccesity, but doesn't quite get their point across. They provide great knowledge and information, despite being off-topic occasionally. This article is full of great facts, but the delivery is off and could have potentially been a better read if the author was on the other side of the argument, which has more proof to back it up. All in all, the author does not support their idea the best.",0
"The presidential Elections.

The elections are a brutal time candidates compete for the favor of the citizens they campaign, give great speeches about why they would be best for the position of leading the nation, often state why their adversary would be the worst person for the job. This causes opposition in the nation tearing it apart, however now not only are the people emotional about the election but also about the process, their are aguments about whether or not that the original process would remain. The system that the elections have been held since the Constitution has been written was that each citizen in a state would vote for one candidate or the other by voting for the electors of that specific person then the electors in turn would vote for the candidate and their votes would decide the presidency as stated in paragraph six and seven of the first source"" What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register. This system although it has worked so far it is not the best way of conducting the elections in this time and age citizens should modify and conform the process to fit the need we have now.

The problems claimed by the ones poised to the electoral college, as told in the second source "" The Idefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, are that the process cause individuals to have little to no say in the person that will be their leader for years, they do not have control over who their candidates elect and must simply hope that they do indeed vote for who they promised to, also the election is decided by the few states that do not have a predetermined majority of voters in each state leaving the rest of the country feeling left out of the fiasco of the election and as if their perfered candidate dose not care of them or their support and opinions. This presents the system to be truly flawed in the way that it is currently operating.

Individuals,as source three ""In Defense of the electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner, wish to claim that the system is not flawed in great lengths because it has worked for such a time that it is seen by them sufficient in its orcastration. It is said that the electors often do vote for who they pleaged they would and that decite is uncommon: however why should America risk the possibility of decite it has happened befor and if not prevented it will happen again. Do we not owe it to ourselves, posterity, and country to fix all potental harms to our nation the presidency should not be taken lightly it is a grand position that gives power and fame to all who hold those who have it could maintain the country, grace the nation with new prosperity, or condem Americans to years of suffering, toil, and misery. As citizens we should not alow anyone but the most valid character obtain this place. Mistakes are not alowed! we should take it upon ourselves now to modify this method be for it is to late and avertid.

There is no mitake America must act fast and modify this method for the nation, for their children, and for themselves.",0
"People like me like to think what their choices are when people give advice. When I get advice from one person I have to ask another person just to see if they would give the same advice. I like to know that i have choices to pick from but thats it about me. People like me like to hear everyone opinions just to whats different about what we think. Sometimes we dont have that right advice to give ourselves so we hear what other people have to say.

When people take advice from one person they dont know if they telling the best advice that is good for them so what we do is ask someone else just to see if we can get better advice from someone else. When you hear advice from just one person maybe you don't feel like that was the advice you could of got, so we ask different people what there advice would be to see if you have a better choice. We know that everyone is different no one ever has the same advice but some people dont give the best advice and some people give great advice.

A lot of people give different advice we will not think is correct or maybe we think its the best but sometimes we got to keep our choices open. Ex: when are mom give advice it may not be the best so you may ask your dad to see what he will say and he say something way different then what your mom said so now you like you dad advice more the your moms. There is nothing wrong with getting advice from 10 different people. some one may not like that advice that the person give them so what they do is ask some friends or mom an dad just to be able to think. Maybe you might come up with your own advice but dont think its the best so you hear other people opinions. Having choices to run through is always good cause you can can like like that advice someone give you but you know that might not be like best or you might not like it so ask people. When you have choices to go around you can make the best choice.",0
"Throughout time, pollution has been known to be a huge environmental problem. The excessive amount of individual car owners driving down streets is in no way helping this issue. Efforts to diminish the number of cars we see on our roads have been taking place in order to help the environment and therefore citizens as well.

It is no news that passenger cars are harmful to the environment. They release gases that pollute the air we breathe affecting not only us but the environment as a whole. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of green house gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some areas in the United States Source 1. This realization has led to the promotion of ""carreduced"" communities by the U.S Environmental Protection Agency Source 1. But the problem is more widespread than that. Paris has acknowledged the importance of this issue after witnessing smog that rivaled Beijing, China, known as one of the most polluted cities in the world Source 2. Paris's solution was to enforce a driving ban in order to help clear its air. Due to this ban, congestion was down 60 percent shortly after the intensifying smog Source 2. It is a known fact that transportation is America's second largest source of emissions, therefore, limiting passenger car usage can greatly benefit the environment as well as citizens everyday lives.

Limiting car usage has not only proven to be helpful towards the environment but towards citizens as well. With a decrease in car usage comes new benefits not just to individual citizens but to communities. Less cars means less time in irritating traffic. Usually, car traffic and traffic jams leads to huge amounts of stress. This is because the idea of not getting to work is stressful not getting to work means losing money. Losing money adds even more stress. But when limiting car usage, losing money is not an issue one has to think about. Carlos Arturo Plaza agrees by stating that ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress..."" Source 3. Rushhour restrictions and other efforts towards limiting car usage have cut traffic making it easier for citizens to get to their jobs Source 4. Those who choose other forms of transportation that are less harmful to the environment have even less of a problem and appear to be much happier. Heldrun Walter states that when she had a car she was always tense but now she is much happier Source 1. The evidence has proven that limiting car usage is beneficial to not only the environment but to citizens daily life as well.

Keeping a clean environment is something of major importance. If one does not take care of the environment there will seize to be a healthy environment in which to live in. Limiting car usage is a big step when it comes to keeping the environment free of pollution. Not only is it beneficial to the environment but it helps citizens live a much happier life lessening the causes of stress. Limiting car usage helps the air needed to breathe, the money coming into your pockets, and one's overall happiness.",0
"Although chatting on a mobile phone while driving impacts how an individual drive, content informing thinks about the riskiest impact.

"Others would not appreciate kindness.

First acts of kindness has an impact on others because others may not be used to being kind to everyone around our environment.

Next showing kindness to other people is not something everybody does on a daily bases however that does not mean we hate each other we just don't show what kindness really looks like.

Finally it's not always good to be kind to others because other people like to be treated good or bad.

Kind isn't always the best choice.

First being kind isn't always the best choice in different situations. For example picking if a student should get bullied or choosing a friend for you to help on the test like who would a help.

Next kindness can also lead you to big trouble. For example u standing up for a student who gets hurt and bullied by the bully if your school has no cameras around it's easy for the bully to lie about the situation that happened with the kid who got bullied if there are no cameras in your local school.

Finally about the bullying part the person who is getting bullied by the bully and the person who is standing up for the kid who gets bullied they can even get in trouble for interfering.

Don't be kind to those who aren't good people

First students and others who are being mean to you they are probably not a good person therefore don't talk to them and shouldn't be kind to them.

Also a reason to not be kind to those who aren't good people is because they have the discipline to teach themselves to treat others right.

Finally if you are getting annoyed by the person who is being mean to you than talk to a teacher about it and they can talk to the student about being kind to others.",0
"As a young child peers into the endless night sky from his bedroom window, a bright flickering spot catches his eye and leaves a single question in his mind: ""Is there anybody there?"" In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author writes about that same bright spot, known as Venus, and explains that studying this planet will real human scientists is worth it despite the many obstacles it raises. By including staggering information of the endless hazards and later reassuring their readers with astonishing facts and likely solutions to survival, the author clearly supports their ideas very well. There may just be a chance for us to see Venus as more than just a bright little star after all.

Initially, the author puts more focus to the first half of their claim as they describe the dangers of this not-so-easy planet. The author informs us that even mighty submarines would not stand a chance in the undoubtably strong Venusian atmosphere; they continue to say that most metals would simply melt under its pressure (paragraph 3). By including such daunting information that makes human life anywhere near Venus seem impossible, it can easily be seen that the author supports that Venus is no cake-walk. Also in paragraph three, the author includes ""additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes"" in the background of Venus's already packed daily weather forecast. The author used these earthly disasters and explained how they happen regularly on Venus to prove just how many abstacles there are for scientists who wish to go to the planet, furthure showing their understanding of the idea that putting humans of Venus could be very harmful. Thankfully, exploring this scary planet has its hopeful side.

Near the middle of this passage, the author begins to turn Venus, no pun intended, and the conversation on taking humans there to a more positive angle. In paragraph four, the author writes about how Venus most likely used to be much like the place we currently live; it had amazingly Earth-like characteristics like huge oceans, mountains, and possibly even life similar to ours. With such exciting facts that leave even more questions about the mysterious planet, the author is proving to us that they know Venus has secrets worth uncovering. The author later tells the readers of a plan by NASA to make is possible to harbor human scientists near the Venusian surface by using a ""blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles [above Venus]..."", informing that the situation would in fact be viable for life (paragraph 5). The author showed how they highly agree with the part of their idea that analyzing Venus up close should happen by giving a reassuring soulution from such a well known and trusted organization as support. Exploring our planet's twin seems like it's not such a giant leap anymore, rather, it looks like it will only take a few small steps.

Keeping all of this information in mind, it is clear that the author is a firm beleiver that Venus, although it has put many seemingly impenatrable obstacles in our way, is worth taking a look at with human eyes. If we follow calls to action such as this, we will put the human race just that much closer to understanding the mysteries of the infinite universe around us, but Venus is a good starting point. As a young boy's eyes slowly slide shut, he can still see a tiny flahing light shining through the darkness outside his window blinds; he dreams of the day he can finally meet it.",0
"I think that the Facial Action Coding System is a good software improvement because people don't always tell whats going on with their life, even if sombody ask them what is wrong with them, they just don't want to talk about it.

This new software will make things more easier for people who try to determine wether the person is happy, mad, disgusted, sad or disappointment. But it also will make other people uncomfortable, those who have problems or they just don't want to talk about it, they might feel ashamed, furios or emberrass and will cause low selfsteem in their lives. In the picture in the right about Mona Lisa, according to the Facial Action Coding System she is 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful and 2% angry, maybe she never talk about how she felt when the picture was took and people just say she was happy and she wasn't happy at all . in conclusion, these new technology will make people understand more how other feels and people will be able to understand and konw more about that person's life and why they feel like that, and just making things up that are not true.",0
"Have you ever asked anyone for advice, well I have. Asking for someone else's advice can be very helpful because there is more then just one or two ways to do something. Their's not just one path you can take, matter of fact there's at least six different paths you can take. So I think advice is very important because it can help you with problems, questions,and how to do something.

Have you ever had a problem that you didn't know how to solve, this is where advice comes in handy. When you have a problem and you don't know how to solve it just ask some one for their advice it could work. Half of the time your own advice is going to lead you down the wrong trail. Some people don't ask for advice because they think their own is better or they just simply dont care about what the other persons has to say. Therefore I think getting advice is a good start to solving a problem.

If you have a question ask some one for their advice they might have the answer to your question. Advice is a very good way to solve a problem or a question. Personally I go to my grandmother and ask her for advice because I know she has the answer to 90% of my questions. I have a lot of questions because I'm a very curious boy and the internet give me false information 80% of the time, so advice is my number one thing. Therefore I think advice is and start to answering a question or it could be the answer to your question.

Have you ever been building a model or doing homework and not knowing how to do something... this is where advice comes in the handiest. Not knowing how to do somethings angers me the most especially in a video game. I live in a house where I'm the main one who knows how to do stuff. So if I don't know how to do something then nobody knows. Therefore I think advice is the one way ticket to learning how to do something.

So in conclusion I think advice is a very useful and effective way how to get things done every day. In my house me and my grandmother are the two smartest people in the house, but my grandmother is the only one give advice. This is because she is the smartest and oldest and she been through millions of different scenarios. So I think advice is very important because it can solve problems, answer questions,and help you do something.",0
"In the world we live in today, cars are used by people nearly everyday. To some they are looked at as a need such as water, food, or shelter rather something we want to improve our life. Although, it may improve our lives in the particular moment to some degree, we fail to see the greater and more long-term effects from everyday car usage. The following sources reviews these effects and reveals the problems and solutions we may have to fix them.

One of the more serious and more recognized problems from car usage is the steady increase of greenhouse gas emissions produced from vehicles all over the world. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. Vauban, Germany is an example of the effort being made to reduce these greenhouse gas emissions, this experimental city is trying to remain ""car-free"" and in doing so the city itself has to make its own changes. This basic precept is being adopted around the world by trying to compact suburbs and make them more accessible by public transportation.""When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" said by heidrun walter(source 1). With this new experiment, people are finding ways to adapt and live the changed life while others actually feel better off.

Another serious and impacting issue from car usage is the increase in smog over big named cities. In paris, after days of a near record breaking pollution, paris bans driving throughout the city in attempt to clear up the skies. Diesel fuel is looked at as main problem paris faced in cleaning out the intesifying smog, since a france tax act favors diesel over gasoline it displays an issue the france government must correct in their own wrong doings. A different look towards car usage is that recent studies show americans buying fewer cars, getting fewer and fewer licenses, and also driving less overall. If this pattern continues there will be positive reinforcements for carbon emissions and the environment, since its the 2nd largest emission producer in America. The internet brings a whole other chess piece to the game allowing kids to feel more connected with people without driving anywhere. ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" said by Bill Ford excutive chairman of the Ford Motor Company(source 4).

A program set up in bogota, colombia is a program developed to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. ""its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" said businessman carlos arturo(source 3). Sports centers and parks have also increased throughout the city;bad conditioned sidewalks have been replaced with smooth ones;rush hour restictions have been cut largely; and high class shopping districts have also been created. This program is already looked at by many countries and is being observed by the world like an exciting experiment.

There are many advantages to limiting car use and these are just few of them. Overall, the advantages observed are just from the few examples of less car use that we have, if more people look towards this problem of over used cars.",0
"Some people ask only one person for advice, but when talking to multiple people it can give you more advice. i agree with this statement. Here are my reasoning's why people should get advice from more than one person.

First maybe they don't know how to handle the situation. I say this because asking more than one person can help you more on trying to find a way to handle the situation. Also getting advice from then one person is good because it gets less stress off your back and you are hearing what other people have to say.

Secondly talking to more people can give you more advice on what to do. If you just talk to one person it may not help but if you go to more that one person you can gather everyone s advice and see which one is best for you. Maybe the first person that gave you advice was good but the other people you didnt like there advice. From there you can gather everyone s thoughts and see whats best for you. And if you don't know something the best thing to do is ask someone. And if you aren't sure if you are making the right choice then keep asking until you get the right information.

Lastly maybe your just unsure. My reasoning behind this is when your involved in something and your unsure on what to do asking a group of people would be your best choice. This helps you with getting more ideas and help with something. Say i wanted a pet cat but i didnt know the bad things about cats. I could ask multiple people on advice about cats and that could help me so i could be sure i am making the right choice.

Those are my reasons why asking multiple people for advice is good. Because not being unsure or making bad choice isnt okay so its always good to more than one person for advice on what to do.",0
"What is the one thing a citizen of the united states sees just about everyday of their lives, vehicles. Vehicles are one of the most important creations America has ever had to offer but sadly there is a catch its killing this planet we call Earth. But there is a simple way to stop this atrocity from going any further. Its quite simple really all we need to do is limit our time driving. The advantages of doing this will help stop air pollution, reduce stress, and help urban and rural areas feel more like a community.

its incredible how with time communitys stopped being what they used to be. What happened to everyone knowing everyone in their community. Well if we limit the time of driving not only will we need to find people to carpool with, Americans are going to start meeting new people and start becoming more of a community again. study last year has shown that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. They either biked everywhere or carpooled with friends and family becoming dependent on other people in their communitys.

The danger and stress that comes with driving is unmeasurable. overtime you drive on the road you are putting your life and everyone your driving with lives in danger. Its only reasonable to say the less amount of people driving the less stressed Americans are. In the passage carfree day spinning into a big hit in bogota, by andrew selsky he states ""Its a good opportunity to take away stress..."" and many other articles state that as well such as In German suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars written by Elisabeth Rosenthal ""when i had a car i was always tense. im much happier this way"". Driving less stressed will also lead to less accidents and less deaths per year.

Pitch black sky, every breath you take is killing you, and you wonder why did this happen, and you think back to all the advice people gave to you about driving. The future is sometimes hard to think about when your living in the present but the future will come and what it is will be based on what you make it. Air pollution is one of the biggest risks to this earth we have. To help stop this pollution well have to give up on using gas but for now lets take a baby step and just limit our time driving. Many communitys have stopped and or limited their time driving. Bogota located in colombia, paris, Vauban located in germany, why not just limit time spent driving in America.

Let us be the last of a dying breed and the birth of a new generation by being role models and start acting as americans worried about this planet. Out of everything asked for us to do this is only a tiny portion of it. This change will not only help us altogether it will change the outcome of the future for the better.",0

"Dear State Senator, I send you this letter to bring up an issue that is often debated amongst us Americans. Should we kee the Electoral College? No! The electoral college just doesn't work anymore and we have seen that in the past. You probably ask yourself what is wrong with the Electoral College? The problem with the Electoral College is that it is unfair, it doesn't rely on what the people say and it can sometimes really make the public mad.

The Electoral College is really unfair, especially for voters. We vote for who WE want, not for some other guy to say what we want. Voters want THEIR voice to be heard when they vote not someone else's. When we vote for a presidential candidate we want to vote directly for who we are voting, we want to pick who we want directly. In source 2 the article explains how the Electoral College works. The author says ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president."" What this means is that when you voted for Obama you didn't vote for Obama , you voted for a group of people to vote for who they wanted. So your voice was not heard. Don't you find that unfair to the voters and to the candidates?

overtime one person votes for a certain presidential candidate, they are basically ignored. The President should be chosen by the people! And at the moment the President is being chosen by politicians who will ""represent"" us and repeat what we say although that has been proven to not always be true. Passage 2 reminds us of the incidence in the 2000 election in which Al Gore lost the presidency to George W. Bush by electoral votes, even though he had more individual votes. This proves that our state representatives will not always represent us how we want them to, but how they want to represent us. This is the reason why voters need a direct voice from them to picking their leaders. We should pick what we want not what some politicians want. You are probably saying that these incidents do not happen very often, as said in source 3. The article says ""...it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000...but that was the first time since 1888"" This says that situations like this are very rare, yet it is still possible. Even so, wouldn't you rather the people be heard rather than a politician that claims to represent his state?

So many people got mad in 2000 when they just chose the president most people didn't want. There's many ways to make us Americans mad and this is just another one of those ways. In the United States you are supposed to be able to choose what you believe to be right. If you want to choose what you think should be the future's right president then you should be able to pick him and not have to expect anyone's approval or opinion on your vote. You should be able to walk out from the voting center and say I voted for this guy. Eventually keeping the Electoral College will only cause more problems, because as time goes on the human develops its opinion futher and creates and spreads new ideas meaning that there will be more people picking different things. If you think that what you are picking should be picked you should be able to say ""I want that"" and not have to through the bother knowing that a politician may have chosen what you DON'T want. If you want to make Americans mad, then keep the Electoral College.

In conclusion I think that the Electoral College be removed and the use of popular vote be put into effect because the Electoral College is unfair, it does not reply on what the public says and it makes the Americans mad. Please take this letter into consideration.",0
"Negative, We have to take Information about the Books, Play games etc. Ok We do what we want, but not everthing we do it is correct There is will be correct some will be incorrect because we don't know all the information about this games, books, shop etc.

"When someone has to make a decision, would they choose to ask one person or many people for different opinions? They choose to interview different types of people as it helps to make an intellectual choice. By asking a variety of people for wisdom, one collects different viewpoints and utilizes their mind to make the best decision.

To begin with, having multiple ideas from others gives an understanding of what choice someone would have to make. Therefore, it is important to ask a vast group of people for their knowledge. For example, say that a female has to make the decision of whether or not to vote in the upcoming general election. She decides to ask for the judgments of her friends and family. The lady will then attain wisdom on the subject from both groups. The viewpoints she receives will impact her decision of choosing to vote or not. Secondly, by asking a single person for advice, one would have to trust they are talking to the right person. Many people invoke their judgments to influence others. Interviewing one person wouldn't allow multiple sources in which one can make a proper choice. The interviewee may or may not give a beneficial judgment to the interviewer. In contrast, multiple viewpoints contains different aspects of the decision. Thirdly, reaching out to a variety of sources gives one the experience of others. Humans carry a huge amount of wisdom inside of their brains. Many use their previous opportunities as a way to impact others. Hearing about different events that happened to others will impact the decision-making; anyone would appreciate to listen to the path taken by multiple people. All in all, having a vast group of opinions will educate a person to make their choice wisely.

Then, by receiving validated judgments, one uses their brain in the final process of making their decision. Firstly, intelligence and opinions balance each other to make the best choice possible. No one in the right state of mind would blindly make a decision without conducting research. For example, currently the world is involved in the massive coronavirus outbreak. As a result, airlines have canceled many flights and dropped prices for airline fares. People have taken interest into visiting the infected places but they realize that they could be at risk for attracting the virus and possibly dying. By using their brains and judgments from others, the proper choice would be to not travel to the contaminated places. Next, receiving useful information will impact your decision. Whether it's one tiny detail or a statistic that can't be overlooked, it's bound to take affect on your judgment. For instance, a junior in high school is deciding what major in high school he wants to take. The boy looks at websites online to find facts about the different majors. He finds out that being a business major is quite useless compared to specializing in bio-medical engineering. This opinion is taken into account as the junior wants to be useful and help other people later on in his life. Last but not least, one must trust their mind to make the right decision. There's a process into making a solution, and it's valuable to follow. Providing your brain the time and space to make the best possible choice gives one confidence. To say the least, the final outcome involves the usage of one's mind.

To wrap it all up, making the best choice possible is made through different opinions and intelligence within one's self. It is important to realize opinions and knowledge plays a role in the decision-making process. Therefore, seeking advice does help the overall outcome of one's choice.",0
"Just a few months ago I applied to three boarding schools. Last week I heard back from them, I got rejected from one, accepted to another and wait-listed at my favorite. I was supposed to get back to all of them with an answer within 48 hours. This meant I had a decision to make, one that would shape my life for the next four years. I went over the pros and cons of every decision I could possibly make and I just kept circling. I reached out to my friend Generic_Name and I spent an hour talking with her about what decision I should make. We landed on the safe decision of saying yes to the school I was accepted to. I still felt uneasy about this decision, I wan't sure if that was what I wanted. I talked to my mom and she reminded me that I wouldn't really be happy at that school, it wasn't the best fit for me. I still felt that I was fairly uninformed so I sought more help, I talked to my guidance counselor who reminded me that most wait listed students do get in. She also reminded me that this was my education and I deserved to be at a school I felt comfortable learning in. I decided to say yes to my favorite school. I came to that conclusion only because of all of the people I had talked to and the perspectives I had heard. It was easier to make a decision after talking to multiple people.

Everyone lives a different life, acquires different wisdom, and has a different point of view on every subject. No two, three, or four people are going to think the same on every debatable issue. When it comes time that you need advice, you should talk to two, three, or four people who know you well or have gone through the same thing you are going through. Each one of them will bring something different to the table. You might not agree with all of them, and that is a part of the process. You can listen to everyone's ideas and insights and narrow your options down to what is best for you. You might even find out other options are available. But, no matter what conclusion you come to, the more people you talk to, the more confident you will be in your decision.

We often seek advice from others before making big decisions. To make these decisions it is important that we are informed. Talking to multiple people is also a great way to become more informed about your situation. When you talk to people who may have experienced something similar, you acquire more information and insight to help you make a decision. Imagine that you needed help picking a new house for your family, you might talk to your best friend who would suggest to biggest one, but your mom might suggest the smallest one, less to clean, and another parent might suggest to middle one because your kids need space. Everyone thinks differently, all of these thoughts together can help you make the smartest choice. Notice how when scientists or researchers conduct their studies, they use multiple people rather than just one. That is because they recognize to importance of gaining information from more that just one person. You can feel better about your decision if you know you were informed about it first.

When asking for advice, it is important to talk to multiple people and hear multiple opinions. This will make you more informed about the choice you are going to make. When you are informed, you are likely to make the best choice. Talking to multiple people has helped me to make decisions about my life and particularly my new school. While I have mostly just mentioned big life decisions, it doesn't mean that you have to limit this process to life changing decisions. In everything that you do, talk to multiple people, listen to their ideas, and become more informed.",0
"In my town getting your license is a huge deal. As soon as I turned fifteen I went streight to the DMV to take my test and get to driving as soon as possible. In countries and cities such as Germany, France, and Bogota, driving is ban pretty much where ever you go. After days of near-record pollution,paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city and as a result congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog. Smog flooded Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the entire world.

Limiting car usage has numerous advantages from streets being safer than ever, to totally eliminating smog that drapes over the world today.

Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions and desil fuel was blamed. we the people want to stop the pollution and eliminate it once and for all so the People proposed "" A day without cars"". It's part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s. This campaign has seen the construction of 188 miles of nicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to the citys mayor. Parks and sports centers have beeen packed throughout the city, Sidewalks have been redone, rush-hour restrictions have cut traffic, new and more resturaunts have been built, and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

The end of car culture has hit everywhere and id just getting to the U.S.

President Obama's goal to curb the United states' greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient  shift in American behavior. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewwer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. the essential question is "" Has America passed peak driving?""

the United states had been long one of the worlds prime car cultures. But America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. when adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily after. As of april 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in january 1995.

""different things are converging which suggests that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,"" said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and policy center. She cites various factors about how the internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet your friends. the renewal of centercities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. The rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexable commuting arrangements, inncluding the evolution of shared va services for getting to work.

a study last year found that driving by young peopple decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009 and even car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright. ""pedestrian, bycycle, private cars, commerical and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emmissions and improve safety.""",0
"Dear Senator,

I would like to argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College. I believe that having an Elecotral college vote helps the President have a greater chance of becoming elected. This process also makes it a fair game of becoming elected for President.It's not only about the President though. When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors.

As I mentioned before, having and electoral votes makes it fair game for everyone. It states that the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. This means that the presidential candidate cannot get votes based on the region they are from. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a President. He gains no votes by increasing pluraity in states that he knows he will win. This results with unlikely success of the President.

The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. When no candidate wins a majority of the vast cast, it causes complications in the presidential election process. That's when the Electoral College steps in and prodices a clear winner.

Sure it can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may not be the best way of geting potential voters for a candidate, but the way they do things makes it fair game. It keeps the system balanced. The Electoral College is an established compromise in the Constitution brought on by the Founding Fathers. It's something original that I think should live on instead of being taken away. The Electoral College should stay.

"Have you ever asked someone for advice? Did you go to one person or did you go to several people for advice? Does it matter how many people you ask for advice? In short, yes it does matter how many people you ask for advice. In fact, the more the better advice you get. Asking more than one person for advice can get you better version of what you're trying to do. The more people you ask, the better the answer. Asking more than one person for advice can get you a more accurate rating of what you should do. The blue socks or the red socks? Ask around, see which ones your friends and family enjoy more. Sometimes, you can also get another option if you're stuck. Let's say you're working on a project and you don't know what to do. Ask some people as to what you should do, maybe you'll get an amazing idea.

Asking several people for advice can give you a more beneficial response. Let's say you have a massive test, your friend has already taken this test. You ask him, ""Should I study?"" He responds with, ""No, it was easy."" So you just go with his advice and you don't study. You get to the test day and you realize don't know anything about it, you end up failing the test. If you had just asked your other friends for advice as well, you would've known that it was hard and that you needed to study. You shouldn't just ask one person for advice, they can't just be the end-all-be-all decision maker. You should ask several people whether or not you should do something. A person can be invalid, bias, or even wrong, that's why you consult more than one doctor when you have bad news. Maybe the other doctor realizes something the first one didn't. It's also precisely why consulting more than one person for advice can give a better answer.

Asking a variety people for advice can also give a more accurate response of what you should do. Maybe you're indecisive about which gaming console you should get, X box or PlayStation 4? You ask your friends and you decide, they give you the pros and cons and even tell you which one they have. You can get a more accurate response of what you should do. You should always consult a variety of people because maybe they can think of something you can't. Different people think about things in different ways. Just the like X box or PlayStation 4 example, people have their reasons, different people have different reasons. Let's say you have a more important decision, like which medication you should take. You should ask different specialist and pharmacist about which one they think is better. Maybe one has less side effects than the other, you won't know unless you ask. If you ask a variety of people you'll get answers that reflect on the right decision that you should make.

Asking more people can get you different options if you're stuck. Maybe you don't know what you should write on your essay, you're just stuck and you can't think of what to do. Ask your friends and family as to what you should write, maybe they can give you different options of what you can write. Different prompts, different styles of writing, everyone has their own experiences. You haven't done everything which is what makes other people's points valid, maybe they've done something you haven't. You may get stuck but you shouldn't stay stuck if you ask for advice. The power of asking several people is endless, people can come up with amazing ideas, even if you can't. If you're stuck, ask for some advice, maybe someone was in your shoes and they can give you and answer.

It matters that you ask a variety of people for advice because advice can make and idea better, or you could find an amazing idea from advice. You shouldn't rely on one person to give you advice, you should have a group of people. The more people you ask, the better the advice will be. Advice can add on to an idea or it can build an idea. Asking for advice gives you more accurate feedback of what you should do. Maybe you're indecisive and you don't know what to do, ask for some advice to help you along your way. Maybe you can find another solution to the problem you're thinking of, maybe someone has a brilliant idea but they just haven't discovered it. You can be the person who can discover it. You need to ask for advice, you can't get by in life if you don't.",0
"I think it will be ok because it will be cool to see other painting emotional. Then people can know how she was during the painting. In classroom it could be ok but i think some students wont like it . Some students might not want what emotional there feeling that day but some would liek it. I will be ok with it. Also it will also be cool it painting a drawing then see it emotional.

They did this in Unversity of Amsterdam with Dr. Huang they developoing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. They use 3-D computer model of the face. It will show every emotional u are feeling when u are there. It called Facial Action Coding System or FACS. The facial expressions for each emotion are universeal. Humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day.

In conclusion it will be a good class to be in and will be fun. They should make a class for it so other students can see the new technolgy. Dr. Hung is smart for making this and the other people that help him. I would like to help him with the project that he did . The FACS will be good for every one that want to see his emotion.",0
"Ai one poini, I believed ihe elecioral college was a bad idea. Alihough, afier reading ihis, my view on ihe maiier as changed dramaiically. The elecioral college keeps a balance in a couniry, a balance very much needed. I agree wiih ii one hundred perceni.

The elecioral college was esiablished as a compromise beiween eleciion of ihe Presideni by congress, and eleciion of ihe Presideni by popular ciiizen voie. The founding faihers feli ii would given congress ioo much power if ii elecied ihe Presideni all by iiself. They also feli if ciiizens chose ihe seai by ihemselves ihere wouod be chaos.

I myself feel ihis meihod is greai. Ii leaves room for very few misiakes. The problem wiih ciiizens voiing direcily for ihe presideni can be broken inio iwo caiegories: unceriainiy and underqualificaiion.

Anoiher ihing ihai makes ii hard for ciiizens io direcilly voie for iheir presideni is being underqualified. Many people ihink for ihemselves and only ihemselves. They are noi qualified io make choices for ihe sake of ihe whole couniry, ihai is where ihe eleciors come in. These are people chosen by siaie conveniions, siaie pariy commiiiees, and someiimes candidaies ihemselves. They hear ihe ideas of ihe people and manage ihem so ihai ihey are able io help everyone. They are pro poliiicians whose job in life is io preserve our couniry The elecioral college is noi of a democracy, bui of a diciaiorship.

"People love doing their favorites things where it will keep them safe and healthy. Activity means when you are doing something like playing sport, going outside, or participating in some type of competitions. There a lot of activities, you can choose and participate in it. My favorite activity is playing with my friends at national parks. The choice, I chose is playing with my friends at national parks because it keeps you healthy and unstressed.

To start, one reason I chose is that playing outside keeps you healthy. For example, I had one friend like some years ago, but now we don't talk because we kind a faded, so we used to play a lot. One time my health was getting bad because I stayed at home all the time and doing nothing then I talked to my parents about my health and they said that I should play outside with my friends, go somewhere special where you haven't been. Then, I went to the parks and played there tag, played hide and seek, and played soccer. I had fun and after some months, my health got better and I just continued playing those 3 games. It's important because nobody really wants their body to have some problems and then they regret, so that's why you should go outside and play with your friends.

In addition, other reason, I chose is that playing outside doesn't give you a stress. For example, in 2016, I had this big stress about school and about homework and what we do in classroom. I just couldn't focus on my studies and got like bad scores on the test. Then I tried to find the way to get out of the stress and it said that you should go outside, do activities with your friends that you like. I asked my mom about this and she said yes to me then I started to go outside with my friends everyday and I was kept forgetting about my school and homework which was good for me. I didn't have any stress after in 2016. it's important to be not stressed because then it affects on your study and also it affects your health, so that's the other reason, you should go out and hang out with your family and friends.

In conclusion, playing outside helps you not stressed out and keeps you very healthy. As a result pf these reasons will help you in your life and honestly these two reasons are actually reliable, you just have to follow them and there you go, your life will be amazing. Playing outside and doing more activities help you a lot and it doesn't give you any bad day or anything like obviously you don't want any and bad situation to be in your life, so follow them.

"The electoral college has been around for as long as our nation has reined over this land. I fervently believe we should keep the electoral college as it is. We, as people, are not ready for the responability of choosing our next leader directly viva popular vote. Some of us might be ready for this responability now, but the magority of America cannot handel this responibity. The majority has stared riots over lost football games, acknolaged said riots and justifyed them then turn around and see a riot about a kid being shot 6 times by an officer and send in swat teams and start throwing smoke bombs. Because of these actions and the many like it, I whole-heartedly believe if we leave the responability to chose our president in the magority vote that this country will become more unstable than it already it because, most people already do not vote, some are biast, and some dont follow the consititution when they vote.

To begin with, letting the majority vote on our new president would have potential if the whole of the country voted, but alas only a small essence of the country votes for our future leaders. Most people are too busy, or lazy, or just dont want to take part in voting becuse of all of the conficting ads placed on television. One of the most atrocious of these ads was the one from mitt romney when he was in the race against President Obama. They put these ads on a chanel designated for familys to veiw, along with children. These ads inculded vivid pictures of aborted fetus, saying this is what would happen if we voted for obama. I've only saw that ad once, but once was more than enough to make me side with Obama more than I already was. If our president is prepared to threten the country like that then they should not be eligable to even run, let alone become President, and it was horendus to think of all of the children watching at the time to have to see that. Most Americans who are eligable to vote have full-time jobs, full-time school, or are busy in some other aspects of life. These people do not have the time to vote for our president becuase they are working at the time, most work one or two jobs at the least, leaving little time for social graces and time alone, let alone time to vote. One other reason citizens dont vote is just hte sheer fact that they are lazy. A good precetage of Americans just do not care about who our president is or who runs for office, thus not voting out of sheer laziness.

Furthermore, letting the majority vote rule who is our president would have potential if the majority of America was not biased in who they vote for. Almost all Americans have voted baised on their beliefs, or who is running for president. These are the people who voted agaoinst obama becuase of his ethnic background, or what he looked like. This should not go against who we vote for, or who leads us, as long as they are non-biased in what they stand for and have the good of the people in their minds, then they should be eligable, or even voted, as a canidate/president/offical.

To continue, letting the majority vote on our new president would have potential if the majority of Americans followed the consititution when voting. The majority does not follow the consitiution when voting for our new president, thus inducing an unfair campaine and an biased leader. The consitiution clearly states the Church and State are to be seperated, yet many Americans vote baised on the beliefs of their Church on matters of the State. The latest case of this happening was for the ban on gay marrige. Most voters voted in favor of the ban due a passage in the bible that stated that man shall not lay with another man as he lays with a woman, even though there is a homosexual couple in the bible, mathew/mathius something. The story aout a man named Dave and another named John, if i remember correctly, one of them said ""your love exceeds that of a woman"" or something close to that. There are a number of testiments that say not to judge others or to love everyone, but most focus on the one against those. Baising your vote on spiritual beliefs does not help anyone and is unfair towards those whos lifes you are negativly affecting. We should all think logically when voting for our leaders, and ask questions like 'who will this affect' 'how will this improve apon the lifes of my fellow Americans' 'will this improve our dilapitiating economy and crippling structe of the government' along with other questions that relate to how this canidate will improve apon the country as a whole.

All in all, I believe that the electoral college should stay in affect untill America, as a whole, grows up, becuase most dont vote, some who vote are biased, and some dont follow the consitiution when voting. We should not have to write papers on why we shouldnt let the people of America vote directly for our leader, nor should we have to have our rights taken away from those who use their religous prectices as an excuse to hate someone. We, the people, should all live together in this country, equaly, as one, not letting our beliefs negativly affect the lives of others. We should be able to practice what we want, when we want, without having to be fearful that others might punish us baised on what they practice. We, the people, need to grow up before we are allowed to vote directly for our new leaders. And that is why i beileve that the electoral college should stay in effect.",0
"Our character traits are formed by influences beyond our control. For example family has a very huge impact on who you become as A person because you are with them every day. Another big impact on our life is the community we grow up in.

We do not get to choose who our family is therefore thats beyond our control. Family can influence you to either be a great person or A horrible person. For example If you grew up watching your father abuse your mother, you have a higher chance of putting your hands on females. How ever if you have kind, loving parents you have a higher chance of becoming a nice, loving person. Keep in mind we are with our family everyday so were most likely going to end up like them.

We can't choose our community either therefore its beyond our control. Personally I feel like the community we grow up in has a huge impact on our life because it determines the kind of people you grow up around. For example if you grow up in a bad neighborhood you will be around gangsters and drug dealers. As a kid you may think selling drugs is fine because you seen other older kids do it. Selling drugs is going to result in you going to jail which means your going to be around other bad people which is most likely going to have an influence on the person you become.

Others may think seeing bad should inspire you to be better but unfortunately it is not that simple. Your character is usually built over the years not over night.

In conclusion the person we become is built by influences beyond our control and we can not just change when we want to.          ",0
"Presidential elections are a big part of the American culture. They decide who will be president for the next 4 years, who will be the one making all the choices. But is our way of chosing that person right? We use electoral colleges to decide for president. Some people believe that we shouldn't have electoral colleges, and that we should let the peoples vote be the one to decide. But electoral colleges are a good way of deciding our future president for many reasons, it allows for a certainty of outcome, avoid runoff elections, and balance out the distribution of votes.

Electoral colleges will allow for a certainty of an outcome. The amount of electoral college votes are 538 this allows for us to see a clear difference in the votes for each party, as oppose to a people votes where you have hundreds of millions of people voting making it impossible to see a clear difference unless you have a blow out. The outcome of a tie is possible but according to the third source ""A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes538is an even number, but it is highly unlikely..."" Also most states use a winnertakeall system where the majority of the votes in a state would win the electoral votes of that state providing a voice for the people. This this shows that having electoral votes decide the president is a good idea because it marks a clear winner.

Having electoral college votes will also allow us to avoid runoff elections. Runoff elections are when no part receives a majority of the votes. Electoral colleges help avoid that because of the fact that they are distributed evenly and mark a clear winner. ""Runoff elections add a huge amount of burden on the candidates, but some of the pressure is reduced by the electoral colleges"" states the third source.

The distribution of votes is balanced out evenly thanks to electoral colleges. If a state is larger then they will have more electoral votes than a smaller state. For example the third passage states that ""The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012 nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes."" This shows how the state that is larger in population gets more votes pleasing more people.

The electoral college is a great way to determine the future president for many reasons. Some being that it allows for a clearer outcome, avoids runoff elections, and distributes the votes evenly among the states population.",0
"Twenty Five years ago, something oddly strange happend on Mars. The NASA spacecraft, Viking 1 had caught a photo on the red planet that had a very strong identical look to a human face. Many scientist thought it was the work of aliens but here are some facts to prove that this theory is incorrect. Through the process of movie films, books and other things people used to explain this phenonmean, and through scientifical evidence.

When the news spread about the strange human face on Mars, many people became interested in the fact that aliens could have been responsibel for this event. To surpise the face on Mars has become a popular icon, with many Hollywoodfilms, books, magazines, and even talk shows. This greatly increased the number people going with the idea that aliens could be the cause of this but this idea is false. In the atricle ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"", it talks about on April 5,1998 that the Mars Global Surveyor was launched over Mars to check the so called alien monument. While using the Mars Orbiter Camera, Micheal Malin and his crew used his ten time sharp vision to scan the ""alien monument"" and found out it was just a natural lanform.

Even though the scince had proved that the strange face on Mars was just a landform, not alot of people were convinced. However, Science once agian came out to prove once and for all that it was indeed a landform. Using the camera again, Michael Malin and his crew caluclated the picture of the landform while using maximum resoltion and their result was amazing. The photo on Mars and a photo on earth had proved that the Mars face was just a butte or mesa landform. Infact, these are common in the American West!

There will always be arugements around the world, but these facts prove that the Mars Face is just a landform. All the movies, books, and magizines can be be true and interesting to belive, but the science in it all proves that this whole ""alien monument"" and that Mars has a face, is all far-fetched.",0
"Have you ever thought of limiting your car usage or just stop driving period? Well you might. Today the average joe driving to work filling the air with pollution, but tommorw he could be riding a bike or any type of public transportation. Limiting your car usage is very important, you could save the world and it's pretty efficient.

To begin, the earth is filled with pollution, but scientist have been trying to find a solution and I think we just found it. In ""German suburb, life goes on without cars"" Elisabeth Rosenthal writes about a small upscale community called Vauban, Germany where the residents are suburban pioneers. What made them pioneers was that they had given up their cars. Places like Vauban are becoming a trend in Europe, the U.S, and elsewhere to seperate subrban life from auto use as a component of a movement stated in the text as ""Smart Planning."" Also in Paris a law was passed, banning all cars for a couple days as presented in ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" Rober Duffer states that ""Congestion was down 60 percent...after five-days of intesifying smog."" This idea to solve the worlds pollution problem is working.

Furthermore, this idea is also efficient. The idea need you to reduce your car usage and revert to other methods of travel, like bikes, skateboards, and public transportation. For example in ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" Andrew Selsky writes ""millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day...leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" this event has going on for a while it's creating a revolution. This event has ""seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths."" What about America? Well recent studies suggest thet Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by as stated in another Elisabeth Rosenthal article ""The end of car culture"". Also the article says ""If the pattern persists...it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment. Only the future will tell where this solution is headed.

In conclusion to, the fact that an idea like this has been around for years and the amount of progress it has is amazing. The polution and green house problems are going out the window and were to blame for it.",0
"when someone asks you for advice , who do you go to ? when that person is needed to be given advice out to , they sometimes talk to more than one person. when you seek multiple opinions, you can get opinions that can add onto your advice or make it less full of detail because if you need to give someone advice , you need to give them some advice that is going to be helpful. it gives you an idea of what others think about toward that opinion and what and why you think what you're thinking about it when someone gives you the same opinion on advice as yours, you won't get that person's point of view since they already have the same idea as you. they won't be able to add onto your opinion of advice.

however, if your opinion goes wrong, their's can work out for you and the person you're trying to give advice to as an alternative if they have a much more different idea than yours, you have their point of view it can give you an idea of whether you want to add onto yours or edit it.

you can know whether your advice toward that person is going to be helpful or not.

it makes you think about how and why you chose that advice you wanted to give out you think about why that person thought about another opinion thats more different than yours, and maybe about how it might impact you

The next time someone asks you for advice , ask other people and see what they tell you . when somebody asks another person for advice , they'll either get the same thing you were having an opinion of or a different opinion. however, there's no right or wrong answer. it all depends on what you're doing an opinion about , but have to think it straight through before giving out that advice. it's a better choice to know what's best then not knowing something straight up that's not true.",0
"Limiting car usage isnt such a bad idea. For starters, it helps keep a friendly enviroment, it also saves money and time for people to get to know eachother and talk a little more.

To begin with, limiting car usage would help keep a healthy, clean enviroment. In the article, 'In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars' Elisabeth Rosenthal states that ""the Enviromental Protection Agency is promoting car reduced communtities, and legislatures are starting to act, if cautiously."" Which shows that less car usage would help protect our enviroment. Not only the enviromental agency, but the government and people agree. Also in the article 'Paris bans driving due to smog' Robert states that ""the smog cleared up enough Monday for the ruling French part to rescined the ban for odd-numbered plates on tuesday"" giving us the fact that th esmog from the cars was hurting the eviroment and causing smog and reckless driving.

Secondly, limiting car usage would would save money and gas. In the article, 'Paris bans driving due to smog' Robert Duffer says that ""almost 4,000 drivers were fined-diesles make up 67 percent of vehicles in France."" We all know diesles an expensive gas, that more than half of France has to pay for just to get from place to place. It also proves that reckless driving and smog from cars can cause damage to someones pockets with fines.

Lastly, reduced driving can help people within the same community, get to know eachother better because your either riding around on a bike or walking, giving you the chance to associate with your neighborhood friends. As stated in the article 'Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota' , ""parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven pitted sidewalks; rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new resteraunts and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" which shows that driving had good aspects and helped the communty get along more.

In conclusion, thats why limiting car usage would have a good affect on our communities and a good affect on th ewhole world in general, because it helps keep a friendly enviroment, and it saves money and time for family and friends.",0
"The author said the studying Venus is the worthy pursuit despite the dangers. The Venus was the closet planet to the earth and the closet in the distance. In Venus there are 97 percent carbon dioxide and hightly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus atmosphere, and Venus is the hottest surface temperture than any other planet in our solar system.

First, the author said Venus was the closet planet to the earth and the closet in the distance. Earth,Venus, and Mars orbit the sun at the diferent speed. Sometime the earth are closer to the Venus because Venus is sometimes right around the corner. Human has sent numerous spacecraft to land on cloud-darped world. The mission was unmanned because the numerous factor contribute to Venus's reputation to study.

Second, in Venus there are 97 percent carbon dioxide and hightly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus atmosphere. Tempeture average over 800 degrees fehenheit and atmosphice pressure is 90 time greater than our planet. It is dangerous for human's environmant because it would crush a submarine accustomed to divided the deepset parts of our ocean.

Next, the authour said Venus is the hottest surface temperture than any other planet in our solar system. Venus is hight pressure and heat,Venusain geology and weather present impediments like erupting volcanoes,power earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on it surface.

Then, the author said some features that are anologous on Earth. It has surface on rocky sediment, such as valleys, mountains, and craters. The National Aeronatics and Space Administration has senting human to study Venus. They found that Venus would avoid the ground condition by staying up and out of their ways if they fly over many storm. At the thirthy-plus miles above the surface, temperture would be toasty at around 170 degrees fehenheit, but the air pressure would be closed to the sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth level. It survivable for human.

finally, the author also said Venus from a ship orbiting safty far above the planet can provide only limite insight on ground condition because most of light can't penetrate the dense atmosphere, redering standard form of photography and videography ineffective. Challenge presented by Venus has value because curiosity wil likely to lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.

In conclution, the studying Venus is the worthy pursuit despite the dangers. The Venus was the closet planet to the earth and the closet in the distance. In Venus there are 97 percent carbon dioxide and hightly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus atmosphere, and Venus is the hottest surface temperture than any other planet in our solar system. the author said some features that are anologous on Earth. the author said some features that are anologous on Earth.

"Have you ever wanted to be apart of NASA or a scientist? Scientist get to explore many parts of the world, even outer space. Have you ever wanted to travel to Mars known as the, ""Red Planet?"" Mars has a long history, however some NASA scientists say that in 1967 they saw a face on Mars and some people thought that aliens created it.

Twenty-Five years ago from this date May 24, 2001 a spacecraft called Viking 1 was circling around the planet Mars taking pictures of possible landings for the sister ship named Viking 2. As the spacecraft was circling around the planet Mars, it saw something very odd which was, shadowy likeness of a human face with and enorumous head nearly two miles from the end it seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region on the red planet called Cydoina. Soon scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, however this one had unsusual shadows which made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

As NASA looks at the images the caption said ""huge rock formation."" The Mars then started to reveal images of a face such as the, eyes, nose, and mouth. Mars has now became a famous planet. The planet Mars has starred in Hollwood flims, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even in a haunted grocery story checkout line.

The agurment now is weither or not the face was made by aliens and the answer is NO. In passage seven, it says, ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the orgional Viking photo. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landfrom. There was NO alien monument after all.

I believe if I was in the NASA or if I were a scientist I would use passage seven to back my answer up. It gives all the details about why the aliens did not make the face on the planet Mars. Even though everyone would not be satisfied with my agurement, I now have proof that it was not created by aliens.",0
"I would say that we keep the Electoral College because it has worked over the past century so why change it now. The people voting don't always know what they want in a president they might be undecided and just choose the best looking one. I mean yeah some have their facts straight and know how the president they are voting is going to help the united states become a better country overall. When people have to much freedom they don't know what to do and do wrong choices so i think choosing a elector is a good thing they have studied the president and have heard countless promises that he has done. I mean he or she most likely will vote for the candidate running for president you did because he or she is a elector he or she gets the people who also voted for the same person as he or she wants.

I mean we people are still voting we still have the vote just that our vote goes to choosing a certain elector instead of just directly leaving it to the people to vote for a certain candidate running for president. By this the number is much smaller since each country is weighed and is worth certain points and decided by electors you choosed to trust to vote for the same president you did. You still are in control just that you choose somebody heher is not likely to change his or her mind and vote for the exact person you want he or she to vote for. It stated in the article that ""Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party."" I say that if the candidate political party chooses the electors then they must be good and the party must be sure the elector won't change his mind out of no where.

This does make the candidate running for president try to convience the electors he is the one they need and that he will help our country be better. This also helps the candidate running for president know what states he should go to since some states they already know they lost. It stated in the article that ""A solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the south,has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win.""So this keeps the president from having to go to every state because its just no based of popular vote and want every individual person votes for.

I think the Electoral college is great and well organized the process is good and the only thing is does is make the voting process more easier and ordered. I think we should keep it i mean it has had his troubles her and there but it has worked so good for such a long time. We don't want to change it and create choas since a lot of people are not use to change and don't take it quite well. I hope this is the way we keep on voting i think its great and that changing it would just make things harder on everybody.",0
"There are many advantages of limiting car use. Have you ever thought of just how much gas we use and how bad it is for our air. All the driving we do as teenagers is a way of showing our freedom for most, others just need a ride. I drive myself but i do have to say i couldnt give up my car, i dont live close enough to anywhere so that i could ride a bike or walk, otherwise its a great idea. Some advantages are not as much greenhouse gasses are emmitted into the air.

I also see that without driving some can get more excersize that is well needed and it also gives people the chance to see the things they dont see everyday because they are in such a hurry. It can aslo help use save our resources that have been having shotages. In america not many people are worried about driving and getting thier liscences as there use to be. Another advantage is that we can save money that could be used for other things.

Some places are having days rthat people cannot drive and if caught the get fined. I think its neat seein g a community coming together and doing stuff together. It shows just how are humanaty works.

However, the electoral college is flat out taking away our right to share our thoughts about the future leaders of the nation. The electoral college is irrational, and unfair.

The most basic reason why the electoral college is unfair to our country is because not everyone is fairly represented. For example, there are 55 representatives in California to represent 35 million voters. As you can see, it is an unfair ratio. It is impossible for the House's votes to reflect the views of the people in California. That also means that since each state only has one fianl vote, a state such as Wyoming, who has 500,000 voters, would have as much say as California, with 35 million. California has more people, and my making every state have equal representation, it is messing up representation in states like California.

In the system we have today, it is very easy to have a deadlocked election. In 1968, a mere 41,971 votes would have caused a major deadlock in the election. The same thing happened again in 1976, if 5,559 votes in Ohio and 3,687 votes in Hawaii decided to vote differently. In both cases, and few thousand votes could have caused a serious disaster. History tends to repeat itself, so if the almost exact situation happened in the span of less than ten years, what makes you think it won't happen again?

The electoral college creates an unfair system to gaining votes. In 2000, 17 states, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, who are home to some of the largest media markets, didn't even get the chance to see a campaign ad. If you were a candidate, wouldn't you want your ad to be seen in the some of the largest media markets? The candidates had already thought they won those states, which is a ignorant move to make. Because of the electoral college, and the unspoken rules that have been set in place about certain states views, the candidates missed a greatly helpful opprotunity to gain more votes.

However, many might think that the electoral college is a good system because it gives a clear winner, and it makes the states have equal representation. If the people are barely being represented, and a state with less than a million voters has as much say as a state with 35 million voters, then it doesn't matter if the process gives a clear winner. The people want to have a say, not someone choosing for them.

The electoal college may have been a good idea back when it was first created, however, times are changing and the number of people being able to vote is growing day by day. The voters want to give their opinion through voting, and by having the electoral college in place, it is making voting unfair, irrational, and nearly impossible to do.

Thank you for your time.",0
"I think that we should not have that in are classes because that would make people fill unhappy to come to school. Then that wouldamke people not want to come to school because the teachers would know how we are filling today and whats on our minds. Then they would know what we are thinking. Then they would know when we are happy, when we are mad, when we are sad , when we just dont care anymore. Like they said in the first line she? 83 percent happy, 9 ercent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. Then they said that? not your science teacher, grading your latest lab assignment. They start to talk about how many major muscles in the modle must move like human muscles. there are 44 major mucles that must move like human mucles. Thats just in the face. The movement of one or more mucles is called an ¨action unit.¨

They tell you to do this one fun lab thing you can do while you are looking in the mirror at home.

It gives you step by step how to do the lab.",0
"Taking a deep breath in a city filled with cars and buses, people would be inhaling all the emissions giving off by the heavy duty use of cars. Taking in smog is like breathing in dirt. Changes around the world are taking place to accomodate to the impacts caused by cars. In the twenty-first cenury, cars are a must to get from place to place. So, why is it that there is a decline in the buying of cars? Well, the less usage of cars creates no smog to inhale, would promote alternative transportation, and the culture in this society helps create less dependence on cars which leds to a better envrionment.

First things first, around the world something known as ""smart planning"" is taking place. This is a movement to seperate suburban life from auto use. One main reason this movement is taking place is to reduce emissions giving off by automobiles, that would soon lead to smog. According to

Source 2:

""Paris ban driving due to smog,""  by Robert Duffer,  which states,"" After days of near-record polluton, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" This ban was necessary due to the over pollution cars create and because of it, air was able to become breathable again.  Moreover, in

Source 3:

"" Care-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,"" by Andrew Selsky, Bogota tells the goal behind the car-free day, which states, ""The goal is to promote alternative transportaion and reduce smog."" Clearly, having a bus filled with residents is a better choice than having cars filled only by one or two passengers because one bus would not produce as much emissions than twenty cars.

Futhermore, the less dependence of cars would promote alternative transportation. Having a city filled with people walking, riding bikes, and taking buses would allow a traffic free city. In Europe, cities are taking the step forward by creating a city where it is difficult to obtain a car. According to

Source 1:

""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, explains the main motive why cities are making it difficlt to use cars, which is, ""Its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accesible to public transprtation, with less space for parking."" This means, that by making it a struggle to obtain a car, it would help promote others to use public transportation or another method, which at the end of the day, would benefit the environment.

Last but not least, the culture of the world is constanly changing day by day. In the twenty-first century, technology has taken over the lives of many. From apps to the internet, the changes are inevitable thanks to the breakthrough in technology.  In

Source 4:

""The End of Car Culture,"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University, explains,""Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift."" Mimi is talking about the recent decline of automobile sales occuring which mean less and less people are buying cars. She believes the reason behind the decline is due to the culture in which involves technology. Moreover, she goes on to say,"" Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work."" Again and again technology proves to be a saving factor in this world to humans, and in this case it is saving humans from injurying the only home it has. With the easy access of calling someone up for a ride or searching up public transportation near by, allows the environment to be fresher and cleaner, as well as, it allows humans to interact with one another without having to drive to that person's house.

Movements take place to improve what seems to be a problem. It is obvious that the over usage of cars is a problematic case. Around the world, people are going around side by side, without depending on cars like they use to back a couple years ago. Improvements shown in places like Paris, shows how the limiting of automobile usage can greatly impact the envrionment to create a clean atmosphere. Not only would it help clear smog, but it would allow a stress free city from being populated by traffic jams and yelling individuals, who are experiencing road rage thanks to the taffic. A happier environment would be created when people are out rding bikes to places and walking with friends. In cocnclusion, the benifits of limiting car usage are as clear as water, it would reduce smog, promote other forms of transprtation, and would help our culture by creating a happier, cleaner atmosphere to live in.",0
"Dear Senator, As you may know, there is a huge dilemma with the voting system we have as of right now. I am writing to you because it is in our best interest to abolish the Electoral College and change election to popular vote for the next presidential election. The reasons we should make this change is because the Electoral College is unfair for voters, also a disaster waiting to happen and the popular voting system bring so many more benefits and opportunities for the people.

The Electoral system simply takes away the people's say on who they think the best candidate is. It is simply unfair for the voters. In this system, according to the second source, popular vote, which is what the majority people select, most of the time loses the election due to the Electoral System. An Example used in this source was the 2000 election with Al Gore, he had won the popular vote, but had lost the election thanks to the Electoral College. With this system in play, voters cannot control who they want to vote for and that is not how it should be. In source one, it clearly states most states have a ""winnertakeall"" type of system that awards all electors of that state to the specific candidate, which is the complete opposite of benefiting the people, because not everyone in that state wants to vote for that specific candidate. Source 3 says big states that a larger state gets more attention than a smaller state does because of the amount of votes, however some states claim they never even got to see a presidential campaign had because of how small the states was. Its is Unfair to these states which include Rhode Island, South Carolina. It takes away opportunities from these smaller states.

In source two, Bradford Plumer mentions the single best argument against the Electoral College, which he calls the ""disaster factor"". Voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. This means that voters dont really have control on who they vote for, as mentioned before. The Electors can defy the will of the people, the only reason people vote, in this system, is to ""sway the opinion"". This is known as the ""disaster factor"", the electors defying the will of the people. Another problem with this system is that if there is a tie, it is definately out of the peoples choice. The decision is left to the House Of Representatives. The Electoral College is a disaster waiting to happen, like a bomb ticking, at some point in time, it will explode.

The benefits of switching to popular vote really pays off. With popular vote, these issues adressed would not be a problem at all, such as the unfairness to voters, the disasters awaiting to happen with the Electoral College. The only downside to this is that it will take a little longer to count the votes and finalize the election, but it is worth it. All voters would be at peace of mind knowing that their vote actually counted for something. In my opinion, this is the best choice and option out there. We need to get rid of the Electoral College because it brings us no good at all. We could finally stop worrying about the timer!

I hope you take this into consideration.",0
"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.

When i was 15 years old, i broke my leg and that made me incapable of going to the school for 3 months, during those 3 months i didn't get any support to keep track on my classes because the school i was attending didn't had distance learning; Consequently, i almost failed my school year, because of this i support the option of having distance learning.

The fact that some schools have the equipment to offer distance learning is motivating, because it gives an opportunity to teenagers that struggle to get the education they need and this can be for several reasons that can limit them to get to their schools such as a medical condition, being isolated from their schools, or any circumstances that can happen during the school year; Furthermore, having distance learning as an option that is beneficial to the students and to the schools in general.

Students who are having problems to get to their schools, for factors such as not having money for the transportation or the schools are located too far from them, will benefit of having distance learning. For example, if a student can't get to his school because he can't afford a way to get to their classes on time; Consequently, the student is probably going to fail his school year for not being able to get to his classes, this shows that having distance learning support is beneficial for students that struggle with this type of problems.

Students who have for a medical condition, will have problems to get to their schools because of their medical state.

For example, a teenager that suffer from osteoporosis is hardly going to be able to get to his educational institution, and this is not going only to affect the student in his education is also going to damage his life by not having that knowledge that he needs to be progress as a person in his life; Furthermore, having support of distance learning to student that can't arrive to schools is an important and necessary characteristic that every schools must have in their options, this demonstrates that having distance learning support can help student that suffer from a disease that makes them unable of being present in school.

One of the most important characteristic of having distance learning is that it can be useful in scenarios where the students are in danger of coming to the school for something like a pandemic that would make the schools close, losing a huge a amount of days that will have an impact on the school year; Similarly, to what is happening with the COVID-19 in several country's around the world that are getting infected by this disease and where they are closing the schools because of this virus, however with the use of temporary distance learning students would be able to keep on track of their studies even when a disease or something similar to this is happening at the moment.

On the other hand distance learning can be used in a wrong way, where students simply don't care about their classes, this shows that is not a perfect system that needs to be used only when is necessary to put on practice.

In conclusion the use of distance learning in schools is important and useful to the students when they have problems to get to their educational institution and that it also can be used in scenarios where the student won't be able to assist to the school.",0
"Many believe that the ""Face"" on Mars was actually created by aliens.

This landform gives off the illusion that it is a face.

To clear all confusion, the Face on Mars wasn't created by aliens.

As the cameras traveled around Mars what appeared to be a head from end to end stretching two miles was actually a Martian mesa.

Martian mesa's are common around Cydonia therefore NASA made the assumption that it was.

This Martian mesa was a bit different than the others.

This one had unusual shadows that gave off the look to be an Egyptian Pharaoh but was still considered a mesa.

Secondly, this landform was common around the American West.

This butte or ""mesa"" was just more oddly shaped than the others. This landform was created by a lava dome which caused it to look like a face somehow.

Garvin refrenced the Middle Butte in Snake River Plain in Idaho which is another idea that it was just a landform.

On the contrary, this could be an alien made figure. The landform gave off an illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth.

The passage also stated the landform stretched two miles from end to end which made the ""head"".

If the structure was bona fide that means it was well-rounded and nicely structured which means it took time to come together then it was done by what we call a second life.

NASA would rather hide that being afraid of conspiracy theorists.

To conclude, the ""Face"" on Mars isn't an actual face.

This structure is just a landform proven by NASA with statistical facts and photographs.",0
"""How Small Acts of Kindness can have an Impact on Others."" Happiness, Safety, Health, and Anger. people can be more happy, be more safety, and take care more of their Health and be less angry, a small act of kindness impact others to make better choices in their lives and many others good things. Kindness is a big thing in this world, without Kindness every one would be in a war. So as little of Kindness you have that can still impact other to make the right decision.

First, People will be more happy, when someone act kind to them and made them have more energy to do anything. You can have a better friendship with your friend or a family member so you can be a better person. You will have more friendships, if you are kind to others, people will respect you for your kindness and how you made them happy. People fell depress when no one act kind to them that's why people have to be kind to each other.

Second, People will be more safe, they will be less car accidents because people will be more careful when there driving. People are getting hit by cars often, when you are upset and try to cross the street and you don't look were the cars are coming from you have a big chance of being hit by a car. People will act more carefully when you doing something. Athletes will be more careful so, less injuries in all of the sports. Workers will be more careful about doing their jobs, one of the dangerous job in the world is working doing sky-fellers workers are risking their lives doing there jobs.

Third, People health will be better with an act of kindness and be less angry, people have a better health when they get an act of kindness. People will go outside every day and play sports with others in the sun and people will have more Vitamin D. Vitamin D is good for your health. Anger when people dont get kindness they will do something wrong and they will be less problems and fights. Sometimes people cant control their anger and want to get revenge or do something to someone. The other thing is people act buffoon when they are furious.

"Human emotions have been around about as long as humans have. For milenia humans have been able to convey feelings through facial expressions for many hundreds of years. Peole have also figured out ways to fake or force emotions if they feel it necessary and have been doing so for hundreds of years. While classrooms are newer but feel boring to most,they are a big part of life. Classrooms might be boring, and while it has become possible to use new technology to make learning fun, but this begs the question, is it practical?

Computers are newer and facial recognition is on the rise but is the facial recognition software fit for a classroom? Facial recognition software might be available,but as the article mentions,personal computers can't handle the software. How are schools supposed to use something that requires a larger computer with only a small amount of money to spend? The article also doesn't mention how costly the software itself is so it could be too costly for schools. Most schools simply do not have the kind of money required for this new technology.

The new software could be used to make lesson plans more fun but is that practical. Ignoring how the schools would get this new software,the practical use of it has a cost of its own. Changing lesson plans to be more fun may sound practical,but what about the cost and different types of learning? There are different types of learning,auditory,visual,hands on,and probably more types of learning,but how are schools supposed to cater to those who like to learn differently than the rest? The methods of putting these other types of learning into effect would be far too costly for most schools an would probably require even more software and other technology.

The costs of practical facial expression recognition software usage are big but ignoring that, will people accept a comuter watching their facial expressions? Though the article mentions about facial expressions and analyzing them, it fails to take into account how people feel about this. According to the article,this software could be used to tell if a student is bored,but would students be comfortable with a machine that could tell how they were feeling just watching them as it taught? Many students would feel uncomfortable being watched constantly especially by a computer that could analyze how they were feeling. Not to mention the fact that for some forms of learning the computer might be forced to move around with the help of other technology to give examples which might make students more uncomfortable.

In conclusion while facial reading software seems like a good idea,maybe it isn't. The software wouldn't be compatible with school computers. The cost of replacing the computers and putting the new and more fun learning techniques into practice would be very costly. Many students would feel uncomfortable with this new technology and some things students are forced to learn simply can't be made fun easily. While it might seem like a good idea on the surface,some things just aren't practical.",0
"useing technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom to identify human emotions in class .

personal i think that would be a great idea and would help out a lot. it states that ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored ,"" that could help in a lot of ways . if you computer could do that it would help many students to get more involved in the class work and not lose anybody with lack of understanding or any other reason .

it can even tell the diffrence between a genuine smile and a forced one . it says that in a real smile a muscle called the zygomatic major lifts the corners of your mouth. when a smile is forced the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a diffrent muscle.

i feel like this would help alot in some cases to keep everyone involed it would help teachers know when someone isnt on the same page or doesnt understand, and the teacher can adress that . so yea its a great idea",0
"In recent years, many places all around the world have taken the intiative to lower the use of motor-vehicles, specifically cars, with the intent of decreasing the amount of greenhouse gas being emitted into the air. There are various actions being taken in this attempt, with some neighborhoods going as far as eliminating the use of their cars completely. No matter what actions are being taken, the real goal is to improve the planet and the quality of the air that we are breathing.

As mentioned before, one of the main goals of limiting car use is to improve our air by decreasing the amount of greenhouse gases being put into it. If you are driving your car to and from work every single day, and you live in a city where your house/apartment is about 10 minutes away, don't you think you could ride your bike every now and then? Even if you don't have a bike, you could try taking the bus, or maybe even a taxi. By riding your bike, you are eliminating the chance of putting out any greenhouse gases, and by taking the bus, you are reducing the amount of gas being put out.

Aside from improving the environment by limiting car use, you can also improve yourself. Instead of driving your car everyday, you can ride your bike to where you need to go (as previously suggested), and in turn get a small workout. Riding your bike works your muscles, especially your leg muscles, gets your blood pumping, and even reduces stress. If you start riding your bike, you could improve your health and just feel better overall. You can also avoid sitting in a stuffy car and breathe in some fresh air.

In the end, limiting car use seems to have more pros than cons, so it's easy to see why so many places/people have jumped on board with the idea. Even if cars weren't harsh on the environment, they're still bulky and expensive, being more of a hassle than anything else. Why wouldn't you want to limit their use?",0
"First impressions are almost impossible to change. I disagree because when you look at a person for less than 6 seconds you think you know that person. Until you have a coversation with that person at least for ten mintutes. Your impression will change. However i disagree that first impressions is almost impossible to change. The reason why is that the way a person looks,personality, and their communication skills are always that change your whole point of view of that person. From your first impression, when you look at them.

However the way a person looks from your first impression isnt always who they really are. Your observation on someone aren't truely who they are. The person can be good looking person you've ever seen and you really want to meet them. Until they are the wost person, that you hate so much. This also works the other way around too, the person could be the ugliest person you have ever met, but you never gave them a chance. Thats when you realize that, that person is really good. Its also like dont judge a book by its cover. Until you actually meet that person and get to know them.

Personality can change your first impression. Personality is mostly who you are finding out, who that person is, can be life changing. For you not knowing who someone is can have a big change for you. You really dont know who you are really meeting. Personality gives great insights in that person and who they really are. Also however they want to come out to you.

Also communication is key its really important to have communication. Communication gives confidence to the other person who you are communicating with. That shows that you understand the other person and feel comfortable with them. Having good eye contact and hearing all the information of the conversation that they are giving you, makes them open more up to you.

Additionally, i disagree that the first impression is almost impossible to change. Their personality, the way they look, and communication skills can always change your whole point of view on a person. Looks can be looks, personality being honest no matter what. Communication skills are you by listening, can help you on your first impression. Therefore by taking the time, day, hours , and effort to get to know someone can benefit you from not judging a book by its cover. First impressions can change ,by getting to know that person and who they really are.             ",0
"The limiting on car usage would be a huge positive on the world and the people. As everyone knows, cars now adays are the key to ""Making it around the world"". They say cars make your life easier and its good for the economy. Some of those facts are true but at the same time not exaclty.

Automobiles are the ""linchpin of suburbs"". People can not live without their cars and need them for where ever they need to go ; work,the park,the store. Sooner or later in the future humans might not live at all with the usage of cars. In the article In German Suburbs,Life Goes On Without Cars, it says ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emmisions in Europe"".  All these fums and such are beimg spread in the air. And in Paris, pollution was a big effect on the peopel. Filing the air with smokes and harmful gases that affect a persons health. Do you want to go outside and have a hard time breathing?- Nope i didnt think so. Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France after intensifying smog. Diesel fuel was the cause of that only because France favors diesel over gasoline. This decrease in cars will be better for implications for carbon emissions and the environment.

When you buy a car, you need space for it to stay in. A space can cost up to $40,000 max. That is alot of money you could save for other appliances and daily life products. Also with a car you may get fines for speeding or anything in that state. In the article Paris bans driving due to smog Robert Duffer said motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined. The less cars the better! why go through all that trouble. As well as less cars means no highway usage meaning more construction for buildings and stores. And think about it! More stores you can shop at and save more money to shop at those stores because you arent buying gas everywhere you go and paying for car innsurance.

Cars are benefitial for alot of things. But for the people and our future,it would be best to cut out cars and make our lives healthier and better. It will become a huge positive on the world.",0
"Many people in the world today think that cars and driving everywhere is a necessity; however, many people feel that owning a car is ""impractical (and) undesirabe."" (paragraph 43) There are many advantages to having cars, but there are also many more advantages to not using cars wherever people go. Some advatages include conserving resources, making people have a little more money in their pocket and it also improves safety in many suburban cities.

In the world today, a major problem that still exsists is greenhouse gases. Cars emit a lot of gas that isn't good for the enviroment. In the first source, it says that people living in cities ""is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes... passanger cars are responsible for 12 percent...in Europe...and up to 50 percent... in the United States.""(paragraph 5) Exports mean to say that it is better for people to live in cities so they don't have to drive everywhere. This means that the more people that live in cities, the less gas goes into the air. In Paris, the city issued a ban for driving to try and reduce the smog. The second source says that ""congestion was down to 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog."" (paragraph 14) Only after five days of the no driving ban, more than half of the smog was gone in Paris. It also says that the amount of smog was almost as polluted at the city of Beijing, China, which is the most polluted city in the world. Bogota also did the same thing. They have an event called ""A Day Without Cars."" Participant Carlos Arturo Plaza says it is a good way ""to take away stress and lower air pollution.""(paragraph 24) They also got other cities, and even other countries, to follow suit and join the event. America faces the same problem as Paris; too many greenhouse gases are being put into the atmosphere. President Obama has a goal that he wasnts to achieve and  that is to try and make the enviroment healthy. The last article says that driving less ""will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviroment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants.""(paragraph 34) This implies that the amount of gases let into the air will be reduced. If peolpe didn't drive as much from place to place, the world would be a happier, healthier place.

Apart from the fact that cars give of gas, not driving everwhere also means people save more money. In Vauban, Germany, nobody has any cars, they walk or bike to wherever they need to go. ""Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park-large garages at the egde of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.""(paragraph 2) People would be more inclined to not getting a car rather than spend an extra 40 grand on top of getting a house for a parking space. Also, in Paris, a fine was issued for people who drove their cars during the car ban. The second article says ""even-number license plastes were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine..""(paragraph 11) If people didn't drive their cars around when they weren't supposed to, they would still have the 22 euros they lost. The same type of fine was issued in Bogota, Columbia. If people drove their cars on ""A Day Without Cars"", then they would have to face a $25 fine. However, in the United States, ""recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.""(paragraph 29) Without having to pay for a car or gas money, Americans are saving way more money they had been when they first got a car. Wit people not having to worry about payments or gas prices, they have more money in their wallet.

Not only does not driving save money and reduce gas, it also improves cities and people's lives. Heidrun Walter, a German media trainer, says that ""when (she) had a car, (she) was always tense. (She's) much happier this way."" (paragraph 3) She likes not having to drive everywhere, it makes her feel more calm and less tense. It's not only changing peoples lives, but it's changing the cities. Cities are attempting ""to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with eless space for parking.""(paragraph 6) Cities are changing their apperance in order to intice people into driving less and walking or biking more. They intend to make the stores closer together rather than having to drive across the highway to get to the next store. Also in Bogota, there has been a ""cunstruction of 118 miles of bicycle paths"" and ""parks and sports centers...have bloomed throughout the city.""(paragraphs 27&28) With more people walking, the city wants to make the outside apperance different and more appealing than what it looked like before people just used cars. Not driving is not only good for personal well being, but for the a city's well being.

There are many advantages to driving cars, such as saving time and getting to places faster but, not driving cars is way better in the long run because of a better enviroment, saving money and better cities and personal health.",0
"Dear, State senator

Voting is a public thing that happens every fourth year when a President is resining or cannidating for a second run. People all around the United States vote for a President they think can run the country the best. I think it's not fair that our votes are getting thrown away, and not even looked at. Bradform Plumer said that ""the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational (source 2 paragraph 14), and i think that is true. I think we should Bannish the Electoral College because it is a old process, unfair to Americans, and can lead to disasters.

The Electoral College is a very outdated process. Dont you think we should use a new one? The Elctorial College has been use since the 13 Colnies, and has been ignoring the public ever since. I think its only fair if we have a part in the president election. Also, if we could change it to popular vote, more people would be intact with politics. Bradford Plumer says that ""the eclection is only a few swing voters away from a catastrophe. (source 2 paragraph 12). I agree with him because the Electoral College is very old and can break at any time. I think its time that we change that and start fresh.

America's saying is ""home of the free, land of the brave""; well its not free if we cant vote for our president we want, and the government does it for us. Bradford Plumer says that the electorial college is unfair to voters, and candidtaes because of the winner takes all system (source 2 paragraph 13). The winner takes all system is states choosing if the are going to pick a republician president or demicrate president. Lastly. it is unfair to us. We have no power against the government, and our votes mean nothing to them.

The Electoral College can also lead to disasters! Riaets can flood the streets if they dont like the legislators choice, and that can lead to deaths. Secondly, shootings could start to occuring around the states, and can get out of hand. Inicent silvilians can get hurt for no reasons. Lastly, there can be financial crashes, and everyone around the states could go in dept.

to sum up my letter i think the Electorial College should be bannished for good. You have heard that it is a old process and can lead to falure, it is unfair to americans, and it can lead to disasters all around the country. Give the Americans what they want, freedom!",0
"Phones & Driving

Smart phones have not been around for a very long time , but they have hugely impacted today's society. People can literally use their phones for anything which is not good , because it has become an addiction for many people. They are using them at the wrong times and of them is while driving. People are so focused on their phones that they risk their safety and others safety everyday. 1 reason that it's bad is because you can't pay attention to the road which can cause accidents and driving with 1 hand is not easy. This a very big hazzard that can be stopped , but people would rather be on their phones.

The National Safety Council report that cell phone use while drivng leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries are caused from texting while driving. This is not good. Too many people are being hurt and some are even killed from these fatal car crashes. The regulations must be changed because this is making the roads unsafe. People should not have to worry about if their life is in danger or not because someone is in on their phone.

In conclusion Phones and Driving isn't safe and it should not be permitted.

The Risk is very high and too many people are being hurt by the situation. We should try to fix this problem as soon as possible.",0
"Cars have been in use ever since World War II. Yet, more and more people have been limiting their usage of cars. Many take the alternative of bikes or buses, which ultimately creates benefits for not only one's self, but as well as all of the other people within the area. The benefits of limiting car usage are lowering pollution, creating less road and city congestion, and stress relief.

First of all, people have known for years that cars are a large source of air pollution. However, what most don't know is that ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car intensive area in the United States"" (Rosenthal, Elizabeth Paragraph 5). ""Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions"" (Duffer, Robert Paragraph 15). Therefore, not only do the car emissions go into the atmosphere, but it gets trapped there, so the more cars being used, the more emissions get built up and added. By limiting the usage of cars, the car emissions in the atmosphere that create air pollution can be reduced.

Secondly, many big cities have to deal with cars and traffic congesting the area. ""BOGOTA, Colombia-In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams"" (Selsky, Andrew Paragraph 20). This allowed more room for people to move along the roads and without having to worry of being hit by a car. ""Rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic"" (Selsky, Andrew Paragraph 28). In doing so has allowed for pedestrians to be safer when crossing roads. A benefit in which prevents a hospital bill.

Lastly, stress relief can come from limiting the usage of cars, including relieving stress. ""'When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked the verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor"" (Rosenthal, Elizabeth Paragraph 3). Heidrun isn't the only one who agrees that life without a car is less stressful. ""'It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,' said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife"" (Selsky, Andrew Paragraph 24). Arturo and his wife were participants of the Colombian car-free day program. When you live a stressless life, it is proven that you can live longer, especially when replacing your car with exercise.

In conclusion, the benefits that come with limiting car usage are a healthier world. One, by replacing your car with exercise and relieving stress. Two, by lessening road accidents. Three, by lessening air pollution, which is not only better for the environment, but yourself. By limiting car usage, all of the benefits work out in your personal favor.",0
"Limiting car usage in america would be a great idea! For one  it would make some of the pollution go away and for two our government can find ways for more buildings with walking space instead of parking spaces. This way we can have stores in walking distance instead of driving distance and we will be safe by doing so.

By limiting our car usage we can save the planet from the pollution and saving people as well. In the article '' In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars'' it says that '' cars are responsible for for 50 persent in some car-intensive areas in the United States''. Thats alot!. If we were to limit car usage we could make that number 50 dissapear. It would be alot better for the planet .

When people drive cars they dont know the damage they are doing. when we drive cars it causes pollution to exit our car and enter the air. Thats why it would be safer tolimit our car usage. in the article '' In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars'' it says that '' In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street rather thanin malls along some distant highway''. this is saying that if we limit our car usage  we can walk to the stores rather than waste your time driving to them. I do agree with them.

Important people like Mr. president Obama are encouraging us to ''chill out'' on car usage.  In the article ''the end of car culture '' it states that recent studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer license as each year goes by. This is  showing that  people do care about their enviornment and want to help. They also support the idea of walking . That goes to show that people are wanting to do something about this pollution. Well lets face it America can use the Exersize!",0
"I am against on the value of using this technology to read student emotional expressions. why? because if a computer can read a students facial expressions then the computer can mostlikley see them and that means no personal space for the students. ""While it shows just how much this computer can do, imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad. I also choose to disagree on not having this techonlogy becuase if the computer can tell your facial expressions then when you get bored in class then the computer can see that and get you off topic while in class, astudent can become easily distracted and tooken to another site . ""A Classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored,""Dr. Huang predics.""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective himan instructor.""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive-for video games or video surgery. Therefore I chossed no for many resonings and with them I stay the same, having this kind of technology is good to have but not helpful at all in classrooms.",0
"Dear State Senator,

I read all these articles about some states having to vote for the president's electors. They say basically when your voting for a president, your voting for his/hers electors. My opinion is there should be no need for electors. It should be easy and not too complicated. A presdient, a vice president, and a secatary. No electors or nothing. I think a president can do alot of his own work and think of ideas alone. If he need help than instead of us wasting our time with voting for people to give the presdient ideas and help him out. Well the President always say's God Bless America. Shouldn't the President be listening to the voices of his country. America. Yes, I think the candidate with the most votes should win. But, If they say that their going to do something for our country than they need to keep their word. Make it a better place not for himslef but for everyone. For instance, Barack Obama. What's the need for this unessarcy work that he has done. America is loosing their mind and doesnt know what's going on. Why is he doing this? The president is to make smart decent relevant choices. And if he listen to the voices of Americans than he would have lots of ideas lots! Instead he listens to who? His electors. People complain saying to themselfs, Where does he come up with these ideas? Well if you payed close attention to the presidents background and know what he really wants to do than you would know why. Honestly to me I dont think the Electoral College should keep going its just a bunch of mess that just doesnt make sence. Elelctors dont matter to most American's. Take the electors and the Electoral College away we dont want something we dont need. All we need is a President, a Vice Presdient, and a Secatary.

Sencerely, America",0
"According to the article the Facial Action Code System i think is valuable to student in classroom's. I am for it because aacording to the text its tells you how great it can predict how your feeling. The article gives us a little information on how accurate it works numbers showing she's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry it shows that the Facial Action Code System is an new way to figure out people's emotions. Also it says the Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do. Also this new software can show a lot about your emotions for example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. Also i think its a good idea for students in classroom because the computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored and your teacher could help you or could try to do something more to keep you from getting bored. I think from the articlke this would be a great thing to get and to start using because according to the text its a great tool to use in the future.",0
"In 1976 NASA'S Viking 1 Mars Global Surveyor had taken a picture of a face-like form on Mars.

The area that this was found in is common for having these types of forms.

This land form was found in Cydonia, a region on Mars.

This form on Mars is a natural land form, although many people thought it to be created by aliens.

This thought had sparked sudden interest into the people about Mars, when it was released to the public.

Scientists had further looked into it and found it was just a land form.

However, somone had still thought that this was created by extra terestrials because they knew it was winter in Cydonia, so it was cloudy.

They stated that they thought the clouds could have blocked off many features of this land form.

They also thought that if you had taken a clearer picture then you would see many other features explaining that another life form had created it.

The same picture was later on taken in 2001.

This picture had many more pixels to show an HD picture of the object.

This updated picture showed a much more smooth and almost dome-like formation instead of a face.

This led many scientists to believe that this is a natural land form.

Some of the rock's features still had resembled a little bit of a human face.

Before NASA could know for sure wether this was natural or not they made the face on Mars a priority to take more pictures and find where it is and when they did, they had found that yes, it was just simply a natural landform.

In conclusion, NASA had seen a face on Mars and couldn't figure out what it was so they took more pictures as the technology advanced.

This allowed scientists to know for sure that this was a natural thing.

Many people are still convinced that this is an extra teresrial creation and thet Ancient Eqypt had truely been crated by these creatures considering the fact that this face looks like and ancient pharoa from around those exact times.",0
"Do you agree with ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm, yes or not? I agree with Churchill's statement of success consists of going to failure to failure without loss of enthusiams because not all the time we can win or make the things perfect. For example, when I took my English test last year in my English class. I practiced a lot and I did my best for taking A+ or maybe B+, but I did pass the test. I was very sad, however, my teacher told me that I had a second chance. So, I took it and this time I passed with A-, I was so excited. To fall out the test made me to understand that it doesn't matter how many times we can fall out about what we want, we only need to be strong and try as much as we can for being successful. Moreover, this year my aunt was trying to travel to El salvador, but when she called to the airline for buying the ticket, the tickets were so spends and she doesn't have to much money, so she decided to wait few months. seven month ago she called again to the airline and the prices tickests increase more money, but she didn't want to continue waiting more time so she decided to buy it, when she was buying the tickets the person told to her of her ID was already expire, so she can not buy the ticket. My aunt was sad because she did not remember about to renew her documents, but she went to renew her documents some weeks later and after that she has to wait at less three months to receive the new ID. at this time the three months already pass and she didn't receive her ID, she's really sad because she wants to go visit my grandmother. even thoug she can't travel yet, she doesn't lose her enthusiasm of travel this year to my country. Churchill's statement of success consists of going to failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm is more than true because anybody is perfect and we need to fall out for learn lessons and learn to be stronger persons in the life. some people think this statement is not true because some of them loss multiple times for being successful in their life. also, they say when the person loss the first two times they're losers, stupy persons, or other bad things that are not right. in my oponion this cause happend to them or they are saing that because they loss their enthusiams and become weak person. in conclusion, for being successful we have to fall out in the life, like when i fall out my test and with my aunt cause. this teach to everyone to be stronger person and never lose their enthusiams of be successful in each persons life.

"Studying Venus may be an great idea to the author and it may be very needed.

Venus seems to have had some type intrest to some people such as the author who suggested studying the planet even if it means harming yourself should be acceptable.

The author believes that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Venus is close to Earth and many don't really know this because Venus isn't talked about as much as it should be. The planet was descibed in the reading and the description seemed like it would may be an good idea to study Venus as it states in the text descibing Venus and I quote "" The planet has a rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys,moutains, and craters"" this description gives you an inside view of how Venus looks on the inside.

Although many don't really think about Venus it's a very important planet and the author listed some very good pointers to think about that'll make you want to look more into the planet. The author stated and I quote

"" Astronomers are fasinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth like planet"" the author believes that Vensus was once like earth and he thinks looking more into Venus can solve some unanswered concerns. There is a maybe that Venus may have had an ocean there as it states in the text "" Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life"" this states that it seems to be life on Venus before. If there was life on Venus before beacuse of what their observing then studying Venus might not be so bad and the author may be right that despiting dangers studying Vensus is a good idea.

Studying Venus after all may not be a bad thing after all. The author gave many details and explained a lot about Venus that some mahy have never known about Venus. Venus is an over looked planet everybody knows of the planet Venus but nobody really knows the history behind the planet. The author explained that Venus seemed familiar and seems as if he's been there before. Venus looks much like Earth as if a human once lived there before as descibed in the passage. It seems like Venus is worth risking something dangerous happening to you just to study it because the author suggested it meaning he's down for what it takes to study this planet the right way.

In conclusion the author suggesting that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit shows how committed he is on studying the planet. The author suggested that looking past all of the dangers that comes with studying Venus is a good thing to do because there may have been life on Venus before. If there was life on Venus then studying the planet may give the people studying the planet some good informantion to back up their assumption of human living on the planet long ago.",0
"Electoral college is a process of electors and a poupular vote is by the people. In this argue it ask which one would i favor, i have read the artical and as i was reading i have seen that i would keep Electoral college. I have three reason. one of them it's easier for us understand how the prosses works. my second reason is some people dont care about who they vote for, and my third reason is the history of Electoral college.

My fist reason is the the way the process work. The process works as a number of electors. The electors are what count more thoes are what count to see who are next president is going to be they are the final vote. The electors get together and talk it out so see who wins the most votes. The number of electors are 538. About 270 electors are for the president. The election for the president is held every four years after the first Monday in november.

My second reason is",0
"Some schools thinks that students should attend classes at home. Others might think that attending classes at school will give benefits to the students. Attending classes at school will get the students to learn more subjects than online classes. If students does not attend classes at school there would not be teachers and staffs at the school.

Attending classes at school will get the students to learn more of other subjects. If a student takes classes at home they would not be focusing on their assignment. They going to be on their phone, TV, or other type of devices. There will be no one supervising the students at home. They need teachers to teach them, educate them, and motivate them to learn. Attending classes at school as you can see will benefit the student..

In addition, If the students does not attend classes at school there would not be no teachers and staffs at the school. Many jobs will be lost due to students taking classes online. Plus, the students needs to build a relationship with the teacher and staffs. Online classes would not teach a student face to face, It would be better If a teacher teaches the student face to face. As a result, there should be teachers and staff at the school, If the student takes classes at the school. Plus, the students will get a better education.

Many people may argue that students should take classes online instead of going to school. People think that online classes will give the student benefits. They also think that the benefit of taking online classes, is to give the students more opportunity to learn. In the other hand, they are people who also believe that taking classes in school is better. Schools are meant for students to learn on other subjects. If a student takes classes in school they will have the opportunity to learn much better.

Therefore, students should take classes in school. Schools are meant to be for students to learn from all subjects. Taking classes in school would benefit the students. If the students take classes in school, there will be more teachers and staff at the school. Truly, learning from a teacher helps you a lot, because they are teaching you face to face.",0
"""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa -- landforms common around the American West.

""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin.

""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same heightas the Face on Mars"".

That information was from the artical ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"".

After reading all the information in the artical ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" I don't think that aliens made the face on Mars, I think that it is just a natural landform.

The reason I think it is just a natural landform is because ,all the information I read has convinced me that the Face on Mars was made out of rocks and big mounds of dirt, the shadows on them make it look like a face.

""Thousands of anixous web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform.

There was no alien monument after all.""

Another reason is because I don't think aleins are real.

My whole life I have been told that aleins are not real, and that we are the only living things in our univerce.

This is what I think the Face is made out of and why it looks like a face.

"The technology, Facial Action Coding System (FACS) was created to recognize peoples thoughts/emotions through a facial coding system by the muscles or movements in your face. Created by Prof. Thomas Huang, he tested it on Leonardo da Vinvi's Renaissance painting, Mona Lisa. Not only does this technology just recognize your emotions, but on a computer, it can respond to your emotions as well. Dr. Huang's new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code.

The real question is, would this be helpful or benefit us in a classroom? I think yes. The author states that ""If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar one might follow."" Can you imagine having a computer that knows when your happy or sad? Having computers like these in school classrooms would be so valuable, due to the lack of ""fun"" in school, these computers could determine when youre bored in class and change something about it. Or say you're learning a new lesson in math class, and you're becoming very confused. The computer would recognize your confusion by the facial expression you have and help you out. Dr. Huang says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Another reason this technology would be helpful is because it would be less physical work and planning for the teacher. Teachers wouldn't have to deal with their students being bored, confused, or falling asleep in their class while they are teaching. This technology could greaty change the way class goes during a school day in many positive ways.

The new technology 'FACS' can encode any emotion of yours, this would be so helpful to us students in school for important reasons such as, being sad, or being confused. If so, the computer can modify things or help you out. Dr. Huang did an incredible job of creating this masterpiece, he stated that ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional commnication, so computers need to understand that too."" This technology could change the world, since us humans now of days are so addicted to our phones. This computer can not only help us in school but be a new way of emotionally and physically communicating with other people. In school classrooms, and at home. The Facial Action Coding System is a very valuable thing.",0
"Why do people hate the electoral College Proccess? It's just trying to choose a more helpful priesident. Although the Electoral College should be abolished for there dispicable disision making,there just choosing a way to get a better prisident. Although there just doing the proccess to help peoples everyday lives, but also the proccess is to help other people choose the right prisident and not just because they can talk proffessionaly on a TV screen but to choose the one with a pure heart about helping the people and not just themselves.

Why are people so angry about the Electoral College? The Electoral College process is showing how to choose the right way for a good prisident.""Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsiblities are....""(office of the federal register, source 1).

this process will help choose a president not by how professional or handsome he look but by the his chocies and background he or she has made in the past.""The winner-takes-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the canidates- as we saw in[2012's] election- to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states....""(Posner, source 3,3. swing states,passage 20). But why do people hate this process? Just because it is antiquated doesn't mean it is a terible process, but people and there studorn ways will not drop this stupid stituation and go on with a ""normal"" life.

Even thought this process is antiquated done not mean it need to be abolished and destroy but the true reason why everybody today hate the process is because we want somebody professional but the process chooses the the president right for the cause and not if he professional. We get caught up in this world, but  we forget what the true meaning of being a president. Being a president is a honor but it come with difficult task and you need to learn to be a leader and not be the person behind the mask.",0
