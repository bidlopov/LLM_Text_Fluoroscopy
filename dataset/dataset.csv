It is widely accepted that knowledge can be a great source of power and success in our lives. One way that knowledge can lead to financial success is through the creation of something tangible. For example, thanks to the invention of the light bulb by Thomas Edison in 1879, he and other inventors were able to make a great financial gain. This knowledge gave Edison the power to discover more technologies and inventions, which, in turn, allowed him to become one of the most successful inventors in history.

Not only did Edison acquire financial success with his inventions, but other inventors and innovators have had the same success in recent years. Take for example the invention of the 3D printer, which has revolutionized the field of manufacturing. Through their knowledge of advanced engineering and usage of the 3D printing technology, inventors have been able to create profitable businesses designing and printing complex products. 

Another way knowledge can lead to financial success is through the power that comes with understanding the way the world works. People who are knowledgeable in a particular field, like finance, business, or marketing, can use their knowledge to their advantage and increase their financial stability. Understanding how the markets work, how a business is structured, and the way people buy and sell products, are all examples of knowledge that can be used to drive financial success.

Ultimately, knowledge is an incredibly powerful tool that can be used in many different ways to create real things, generate financial success, and increase power. For those who invest the time and energy to learn, whether it be through inventing products or understanding how the markets works, knowledge has the potential to lead to many great opportunities.

First impressions have a great power to shape our interactions and relationships with others, in both social contexts and business settings. When meeting someone new, we establish initial thoughts and opinions of that person based on behavior, appearance, and initial interactions. However, these impressions can change drastically after getting to know a person better and seeing multiple sides to their personality and character. 

Personally, I have experienced this change in opinion firsthand. After becoming close friends with one of my colleagues at work, I was able to look past the physical and professional barriers we initially had between us and appreciate the qualities that made them so unique. The same can be said for a friend I made in college. I initially got the impression that this person was cold and unfriendly, however, after continuing to talk and hang out with them, I was able to see the friendly, humorous, and creative person they are. 

In conclusion, it is clear that first impressions can be significantly altered after getting to know someone better, regardless of the environment. My own experience has shown how the best friendships or business relationships may often begin with a completely different impression to the one you are left with.",1

Subject: Support for the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my strong support for the Electoral College and urge you to maintain its existence as the method of choosing the President of the United States. While some argue for a shift to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College is essential in preserving the fairness, certainty of outcome, and representation that our democracy depends on.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. As mentioned in the Office of the Federal Register's text, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College tends to exceed their share of the popular vote. This minimizes the likelihood of disputes over the outcome of the election, as seen in the 2000 election crisis. With the Electoral College, a candidate who wins a slight plurality in a state can still secure a landslide victory in the electoral vote. This provides a clear and decisive result, avoiding the need for run-off elections or prolonged disputes.

Moreover, the Electoral College promotes the idea of an inclusive president for all Americans. Judge Richard A. Posner points out that the Electoral College requires candidates to have trans-regional appeal. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, meaning that candidates must appeal to diverse regions and address the concerns of a variety of communities. This prevents the marginalization of certain regions and ensures that the president represents the interests of all Americans, rather than just those in densely populated areas.

The swing state factor is another crucial advantage of the Electoral College. As mentioned by Judge Posner, the winner-take-all method of allocating electoral votes encourages candidates to focus on toss-up states. This ultimately leads to greater campaign efforts and attention being paid to the concerns of voters in these states. In turn, these voters become more thoughtful and engaged in the electoral process, resulting in a more informed and representative election outcome.

Furthermore, the Electoral College serves to balance the political power between large and small states. Judge Posner explains that while the Senate's mal-apportionment may disadvantage large states, the Electoral College restores some weight to their political influence. Presidential candidates recognize the importance of large states as they provide more electoral votes. This ensures that smaller states do not dominate the election process and guarantees that a candidate must consider the diverse concerns of both large and small states.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the complications and uncertainties that can arise from run-off elections. With the current system, a clear winner can be determined, even if no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. This eliminates the need for run-off elections, which can be time-consuming and divisive.

In conclusion, the Electoral College has proven to be a vital component of our democratic system. It guarantees a certainty of outcome, encourages trans-regional appeal, promotes engagement in swing states, balances power between large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. Abolishing the Electoral College would undermine these principles and potentially lead to a less fair and representative election process. I urge you to consider the numerous advantages provided by the Electoral College and to support its continuance.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I trust that you will carefully consider the importance of upholding the Electoral College.

Sincerely,

"Limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can benefit both individuals and society as a whole. This idea is being adopted in various parts of the world, as it is recognized that car usage is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. By reducing our reliance on cars and finding alternative means of transportation, we can mitigate the environmental impact and improve the quality of life in our communities.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a significant source of these emissions, accounting for 12 percent in Europe and up to 50 percent in some areas in the United States. By decreasing the number of cars on the road, we can decrease the amount of emissions released into the atmosphere. This is particularly important in the fight against climate change and global warming.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can help reduce air pollution. In cities like Paris, where smog has become a serious problem, driving restrictions have been implemented to improve air quality. During a partial driving ban, congestion in the city decreased by 60 percent, and the smog levels started to clear. This demonstrates the positive impact that limiting car usage can have on air pollution and the health of citizens.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of alternative means of transportation. By creating car-free communities, like the one in Vauban, Germany, people are encouraged to walk, bike, or use public transportation instead of relying on their cars. This not only reduces the reliance on fossil fuels but also encourages a more active and healthier lifestyle. Additionally, car-free communities often have stores and amenities within walking distance, reducing the need for long drives to access essential services.

Limiting car usage can also have economic benefits. By reducing the number of cars on the road, congestion is decreased, resulting in shorter commute times and improved efficiency. This, in turn, can positively impact productivity and economic growth. Furthermore, car ownership and maintenance can be costly, and reducing the reliance on cars can free up financial resources for other purposes.

In order to limit car usage effectively, it is important for governments and communities to invest in public transportation infrastructure. This includes expanding and improving public transportation systems, creating bike lanes and pedestrian-friendly roads, and implementing policies that incentivize the use of public transportation. By providing reliable and accessible alternatives to driving, people will be more inclined to leave their cars at home.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages that should be considered. By reducing our reliance on cars, we can decrease greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, promote healthier lifestyles, and stimulate economic growth. It is vital that governments and communities take action to invest in alternative transportation methods and create car-free communities. By doing so, we can build a more sustainable and livable future for ourselves and future generations.",1
"The Importance of Retaining the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to express my support for the retention of the Electoral College in the election of the President of the United States. While I understand that there are arguments in favor of switching to a popular vote system, I firmly believe that the Electoral College is essential in maintaining the integrity and fairness of our presidential elections.

First and foremost, it is important to understand the purpose and history of the Electoral College, as explained by the Office of the Federal Register in their publication ""What Is the Electoral College?"" The Electoral College was established as a compromise between election by Congress and election by popular vote, allowing for an equitable representation of both states and individuals. It consists of 538 electors, with a majority of 270 electoral votes required to elect the President. This system ensures that smaller states have a voice in the election process, preventing larger states from dominating the outcomes. Critics argue that the Electoral College is undemocratic, but its purpose is to protect the interests of all states and promote national unity.

One of the main concerns raised by opponents of the Electoral College is the possibility of a candidate winning the popular vote but losing the presidency, as mentioned in Bradford Plumer's article ""The Indefensible Electoral College."" While this has occurred on rare occasions, it is crucial to note that such cases are infrequent. The current system ensures the certainty of outcome, reducing the likelihood of disputes and confusion. In addition, the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, preventing candidates from focusing solely on highly populated areas and neglecting the concerns of citizens in less populated states. As Judge Richard A. Posner states in his article ""In Defense of the Electoral College,"" this system encourages candidates to campaign throughout the country, thereby promoting inclusivity and preventing regional disengagement.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system protects swing states, as stated by Judge Richard A. Posner. By focusing campaign efforts on toss-up states, candidates must address the concerns and desires of a broader range of voters. This encourages voters in these states to become more engaged and informed about the candidates and their policies. Without the Electoral College, candidates would concentrate their efforts on densely populated urban areas, potentially leaving rural and less populous areas marginalized and unheard.

The Electoral College also provides an important balance of power between large and small states, as highlighted by Judge Richard A. Posner. The system properly acknowledges the constitutional provision of equal representation for each state in the Senate. This prevents candidates from solely targeting large states, making smaller states relevant and their interests considered. It also discourages the need for run-off elections, which could complicate the election process and lead to further polarization within the country.

Although critics argue that the Electoral College disenfranchises voters, particularly in states that are consistently favorable towards one party, it is worth noting that the voter turnout in presidential elections remains high, as explained by Judge Richard A. Posner. Voters understand the significance of expressing their political preference. Furthermore, a popular vote system could result in only highly populated states receiving campaign attention, leaving other states feeling neglected and rendering their voters irrelevant.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system has served our nation well for over two centuries, providing a balance of power, ensuring regional inclusivity, and promoting national unity. It protects the voice of smaller states, encourages trans-regional appeal, and maintains certainty of outcome. While some reforms may be necessary to address certain concerns and make the system more efficient, completely abandoning the Electoral College would undermine the principles and values upon which our democracy was founded.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I trust that you will carefully weigh these arguments in favor of retaining the Electoral College. It is my hope that you will continue to support this important aspect of our democratic process.

Yours sincerely,

"There has been a long-standing debate on whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate. While some believe that competition fosters a sense of drive and ambition in children, others argue that cooperation is a more important skill for them to learn. In my opinion, both are necessary, but cooperation should be given priority over competition.

Firstly, learning to cooperate is essential for children as it teaches them empathy and how to work with others. In today's world, teamwork is becoming increasingly important in every aspect of life. Whether it's school projects or extracurricular activities, children need to learn how to collaborate with others to achieve a common goal. Cooperation also teaches children to respect other people's opinions and ideas, and to compromise when necessary. These skills are crucial in building a harmonious society.

On the other hand, competition can be healthy if it is introduced in a positive way. It can motivate children to work harder and strive for excellence. However, when competition becomes too intense, it can lead to negative consequences such as jealousy, low self-esteem, and even cheating. Therefore, it is important to teach children how to compete in a positive way, where they learn to respect their opponents and the rules of the game.

For instance, in a school setting, children can learn to compete in a positive way by participating in friendly academic contests, sports events, or talent shows. This can help them to develop a sense of pride in their abilities and also learn to handle both winning and losing gracefully. However, it is equally important to teach them that competition is not the only way to succeed, and that sometimes working together can lead to greater success.

In conclusion, both competition and cooperation are important skills for children to learn. However, cooperation should be given priority over competition as it teaches children essential life skills such as empathy, teamwork, and compromise. By teaching children to cooperate first, we can create a more harmonious and equitable society, where everyone is valued for their contribution.

Technology has had a major impact on peoples' lives and the way we go about our daily activities. On the positive side, technology has made peoples lives easier and more efficient. For example, the Internet allows us to connect with friends and family from all over the world, as well as utilized for educational and business purposes. Automation has made it easier for us to complete mundane tasks, such as making calculations and filing paperwork. Technology has also greatly impacted the way we consume and create media, allowing us to access a wealth of information at our fingertips. 

However, technology can also have negative effects. For instance, too much time spent interacting with technology can reduce our communication skills, leading to social isolation and reduced meaningful real life conversations. Advances in technology can create conditions for job displacement and unpaid labor, as companies increasingly rely on automated systems. Technology can also be used for nefarious purposes and can enable mass surveillance and other privacy invasion practices. 

Overall, technology has been a tremendous boon to our lives, but it's important to remember that there are downsides to consider when it comes to its widespread usage.",1
"A healthy lifestyle is a key factor in modern life, and it's no secret that regular exercise and proper nutrition can have a great impact on our physical and mental well-being. But the importance of exercise extends far beyond just maintaining muscle tone or looking good; it has been shown to delay the onset of degenerative diseases such as osteoporosis and dementia, decrease stress levels, improve sleep quality, reduce depression symptoms, increase energy levels, boost brain power and even help with weight management. Exercising regularly doesn't mean you need to commit yourself to an intense routine at the gym every day. Rather than focusing on quantity or intensity for better health benefits, try finding activities that give you joy - like playing tennis with friends or swimming laps in your local pool. It's important to vary up your workout too: try different classes or sports so you don't get bored doing the same thing all the time. This will also ensure that your body gets used to different types of movements which works out more muscles effectively than sticking solely with one type of activity. In addition to exercising often enough throughout the week (which should be around 30 minutes per day), eating right is also vital for staying healthy. Eating balanced meals full of fresh fruits/vegetables paired with lean protein sources like fish/skinless poultry along with whole grains will provide essential nutrients needed for optimal functioning while keeping calories low enough for weight control purposes if necessary. Avoiding processed foods high in saturated fats and sugars helps maintain overall health by preventing spikes in blood sugar levels as well as reducing inflammation-related illnesses caused by free radicals found in these Type 2 unhealthy foods are efficiently absorbed into our bodies when consumed too often).

"On the one hand, it is possible that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years. One reason for this is the increasing popularity of alternative modes of transportation, such as bicycles, electric scooters, and public transit. These options are becoming more accessible and affordable, and many people are choosing them over cars for environmental and health reasons. In addition, the rise of ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft has made it easier for people to get around without owning a car. As these services become more widespread and efficient, more people may choose to rely on them instead of owning their own vehicles.

Another reason why there may be fewer cars in use in twenty years is the development of autonomous vehicles. Self-driving cars have the potential to revolutionize transportation by reducing the need for individual car ownership. Instead, people could simply summon a car when they need it, and the vehicle would drive it'self to their location. This could greatly reduce the number of cars on the road, as well as the amount of space needed for parking.

On the other hand, it is also possible that there will be just as many cars in use in twenty years, if not more. One reason for this is the continued growth of the global population, which will likely lead to more people needing cars to get around. In addition, as developing countries become more affluent, more people will be able to afford cars, leading to an increase in demand.

Another reason why there may not be fewer cars in use in twenty years is the slow pace of change in the automotive industry. While electric and hybrid cars are becoming more common, they still make up a small percentage of the overall market. In addition, many people are still hesitant to switch to electric cars due to concerns about range and charging infrastructure. As a result, it may take longer than twenty years for electric cars to become the dominant form of transportation.

In conclusion, while it is possible that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years, there are also many factors that could lead to the opposite outcome. Ultimately, the future of transportation will depend on a complex interplay of technological, economic, and social factors, and it is difficult to predict with certainty what will happen.

"The importance of the Japanese art of Origami to modern culture cannot be overstated. Origami, which literally translates as “folding paper”, is a traditional craft that has been practiced in Japan for centuries. It requires no tools or special materials; all one needs are some pieces of paper and their own hands! Despite its long history, origami remains relevant today due to its versatility. Origami serves both practical and decorative purposes. From decorations for weddings and other celebrations to everyday objects like tissue holders and gift boxes, origami creations can bring joy into any space. In addition to these uses, origami is gaining popularity among children because it helps with improving their manual dexterity while teaching them patience and skill development - skills they will use throughout life. Even those who don't consider themselves creative find it easy to learn the basics of folding techniques with just a few practice folds!. . Outside of home crafting projects, origami also has important applications in science and engineering fields such as aeronautics engineering where designers have used advanced folding methods in creating new aircraft designs that save on fuel costs due to increased lift capacity from lighter structures made possible by using fewer parts overall than traditional designs require. Other industries including medical research are utilizing similar processes when developing 3D printed organs for potential transplantation surgery or drug delivery devices using smaller cells created via folded shapes within microfluidics research laboratories around the world . Finally, there's the philosophical side of this art form too: while children might appreciate how cool they look after making something out of paper alone (or how satisfyingly challenging it can be) adults get an entirely different experience through meditation-like state induced by folding movement itself; feeling at peace despite being surrounded by chaos brings a unique set of emotions often not experienced elsewhere -- feelings associated with mindfulness practices widely recognized as beneficial stress relievers despite ever changing daily distractions present everywhere nowadays . Overall, this ancient tradition still holds immense value today when

"If you open a textbook, for example a math one used in the past at school, it's quite easy to notice that each theory and concept is followed by a practical example that explains and allows the student to get a better understanding of the cited rule. For example, if a student wants to know how to calculate the area of a circle, he or she can look up the formula and find out how it works. The student can then use this knowledge to solve the problem.

I agree with this statement. I think that students should be taught to think critically and to be able to apply what they learn to real-life situations. However, I do not agree that the best way to teach critical thinking is to have students memorize facts and formulas. In my opinion, students learn best when they are exposed to a wide variety of ideas, concepts, and facts that they can apply to their own lives and the lives of those around them. This is why I believe that a college education should provide students with a broad range of knowledge and skills that can be applied to the real world.

"When discussing progress and the steps that need to be taken to achieve it, it is important to recognize that people will have differing points of view. It is only by engaging in a dialogue of contrasting perspectives that meaningful progress can be made. In this essay, I will discuss why the discussion of contrasting points of view is necessary for progress and provide examples to illustrate my point.

To begin, it is important to note that progress is a complex concept. It involves understanding the underlying problem, considering different solutions, and finding a way to bring those solutions into reality. In order to understand the problem and arrive at the best solution, it is necessary to consider various points of view. Only by taking into account the perspectives of different people can a comprehensive understanding of the issue can be formed.

For example, let's say a community is looking for ways to reduce crime in their area. If the only people consulted are the police force, it is likely that the solutions they propose will be ones that are focused on increasing enforcement and surveillance. However, if people with different perspectives are included in the discussion, such as community members and social workers, they may be able to provide insight into the underlying causes of crime and better solutions to address them. As a result, the police may be able to work with the community to develop programs that are better tailored to the needs of the area, rather than just relying on harsher punishments and surveillance.

In addition, it is also important to consider different points of view in order to build consensus and secure the support necessary to implement solutions. If the discussion is only between people who share the same perspective, it is likely that their solutions will be met with resistance from others who do not share the same point of view. This will make it difficult to move forward with the implementation of the proposed solutions. On the other hand, if different points of view are taken into account, it will be much easier to build consensus and garner the necessary support for the proposed solutions.

For example, if a school district is looking to implement a new curriculum, it is important to consider different perspectives on the issue. If only the teachers are consulted, they may come up with a curriculum that is tailored to their own interests. However, if the students and parents are also included in the discussion, they may be able to provide valuable input on what works best for them and what their needs are. This will make it much easier to develop a curriculum that will be supported by all stakeholders and accepted by the community.

In conclusion, it is clear that progress requires discussion among people who have contrasting points of view. By taking into account different perspectives, it is possible to gain a better understanding of the problem, develop more effective solutions, and build consensus to implement those solutions. Therefore, it is important to recognize the value of dialogue among people with different points of view in order to make meaningful progress.

"The advent of technology has brought a sea change in the way we live, work, and communicate. It has revolutionized the way we think and has made our lives easier in many ways. From smartphones to self-driving cars, technology has become an integral part of our lives. However, there is a growing concern that our reliance on technology may have an adverse impact on our ability to think independently. In my opinion, while technology may play a significant role in shaping our thinking, it cannot replace the power of human judgment and creativity.

One of the ways in which technology may affect our ability to think is by reducing our capacity for critical thinking. With the ability to find answers to almost any question at the click of a button, people may become less inclined to engage in critical thinking, questioning, and analyzing information. Instead of attempting to analyze a problem on their own, people may rely on search engines or artificial intelligence to provide instant solutions. This, in turn, may lead to a decline in our ability to analyze and evaluate information independently, making us more susceptible to misinformation and manipulation.

Moreover, technology may also limit our creativity and problem-solving skills. Working with technology can be addictive and can make us less willing to take risks and be innovative. With technology doing most of the work, people may become less inclined to experiment, take risks, or think outside the box. This can have a detrimental effect on our ability to come up with new ideas or solve problems creatively. In today's fast-paced world, innovation is key to success, and the inability to think creatively can cause people to fall behind.

However, while there are some concerns about the impact of technology on our ability to think, it is important to note that technology can also enhance our thinking abilities in many ways. For example, technology provides us with access to vast amounts of information that we can use to expand our knowledge and understanding of the world. With the internet, we can access books, articles, and other resources that were once inaccessible, which can help us to improve our analytical and critical thinking skills.

Furthermore, technology can also help us to collaborate and communicate with others more effectively. With the internet and various communication tools, we can connect with people from different parts of the world, share ideas, and work together on projects. This can promote creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills, as we learn from each other's perspectives and experiences.

In conclusion, while technology has certainly changed the way we think and work, it is not necessarily a threat to our ability to think for ourselves. While there are concerns that technology may make us overly reliant on it for answers and limit our creativity, it is important to remember that technology can also enhance our thinking abilities by providing us with access to a wealth of information and facilitating collaboration and communication. The key is to strike a balance between using technology as a tool to enhance our thinking and avoiding over-reliance on it to solve problems. Ultimately, it is up to us to use technology wisely and harness it's potential to think creatively and critically.

Making decisions about our future can have a significant impact on the rest of our lives. We can look to many successful people who have made their own decisions and seen the positive impact they have had in their lives. For example, Bill Gates decided to drop out of college and invest his time into starting one of the world’s most successful companies. Whilst this decision was brave and unorthodox, it was essential for him to reach his professional goals. Having the support of family is also incredibly important when making decisions about the future. Not only will it provide an individual with a sense of belonging and emotional security, it will also ensure they stay grounded and make rational decisions. Seeking advice from others is also beneficial; being open-minded and taking diverse perspectives on board can only be a positive thing. Of course, patience is also vital to make sure that our dreams can be gradually achieved over time. In conclusion, making our own decisions and having the support of our family can help to ensure we reach our goals, whilst taking advice from others and exercising patience can also be beneficial.",1
"Senator [Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am a resident and a student in our great state, writing to address an issue that has stirred intense debate over the years, the future of the Electoral College. On careful examination of the facts and arguments for both sides of the issue, I believe that while the Electoral College system has its shortcomings, it should be preserved and not replaced by the popular vote.

Firstly, the Electoral College, as per the federal register, was established as a compromise ensuring that both Congress and the public have a say in the election process. Yes, it isn't thoroughly democratic as the citizen's votes technically go to the electors, not directly impacting the presidential candidate's winning position (Posner). However, these electors are trusted members selected by the political parties, and it is a rarity that they betray their respective parties (Posner).

Secondly, Posner highlights that the winner of the Electoral College often ends up with larger numbers than they would have from a popular vote, due to the winner-take-all system. This system amplifies the winning candidate's victory and provides a distinct outcome. In situations where no candidate secures a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College avoids the need and complication of run-off elections.

While it's worthwhile to take note of the criticism presented by Plumer, such as the electoral college being unfair to the voters in states where the candidates do not campaign, it is also important to consider that the Electoral College system requires candidates to have trans-regional appeal. Therefore, providing better representation of diverse interests across the nation (Posner). This representation allows for inclusivity from all regions, making the president everyone's president regardless of their geographical location.

However, the caveat of the current system makes it possible for a candidate to lose the presidency while winning the popular vote, as seen with Al Gore. And yes, the current system puts enormous weight on swing states, which can seem unfair to voters from safe states.

Despite these criticisms, I firmly believe the Electoral College should be preserved. Why? It provides certainty of outcome, mandates versatility in candidates, balances between regional and national interests, and saves us from potential electoral crises. Simply stitching to a popular vote might seem 'more democratic,' but could lead to its own host of problems and unintended consequences.

As a concerned citizen, I implore you to take these points into consideration as you join larger conversations about this issue. I believe retaining the Electoral College is crucial to ensuring fair elections in our country.

Sincerely,

It is important to understand that it is not beneficial to pair older kids with younger kids. To begin, it can be a dangerous situation for younger kids due to an unfair physical advantage. An older child may use this physical advantage to bully or harm a younger child or put them in dangerous situations without fully understanding the consequences. Secondly, an older child may provide a negative example to the younger child. Older kids may influence a younger child to participate in activities or make decisions that can have long-term effects. Lastly, older kids should respect younger kids and not view them as inferior or expendable -- they should be seen as peers in terms of respect and value. For example, an older kid should not spread rumors or gossip about a younger child, as this can lead to ostracism and other negative effects. Considering the potential dangers, and the need for respect, it is essential that older kids not be paired with younger kids.",1
"There is no single answer to the question of whether or not moving big companies, factories and their employees to the countryside would solve traffic and housing problems in major cities. Some people might agree with this solution, while others might disagree. The following is an argument in favor of this solution.

First, traffic congestion is a major problem in many cities. By moving big companies and their employees to the countryside, this would reduce the number of cars on the road. This would then make it easier for people to get around the city.

Second, many cities are struggling with a housing crisis. The cost of housing is skyrocketing, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for people to find a place to live. If big companies were to move to the countryside, this would free up space in the city and make it easier for people to find a home.

There are, of course, some potential downsides to this solution. For example, it is possible that the quality of life in the countryside would not be as good as in the city. Additionally, it might be difficult for people to get to work if they are living in the countryside.

Overall, I believe that moving big companies, factories and their employees to the countryside would be a good solution to the traffic and housing problems in major cities.

We all have unique personalities and regardless of our similarities, our individual traits are what make us stand out. People can have a bad day for a variety of reasons. Stress, exhaustion, and feeling overwhelmed can all lead to a poor mood. Additionally, some people may struggle with depression or anxiety. It's important to take the time to recognize the reasons why you're feeling stressed or overwhelmed, and tackle the issues head-on. 

First impressions are not necessarily who a person is. People can grow and change over time and they can choose to challenge their first impressions of one another and create deeper relationships. It's important to give people the benefit of the doubt. Spend time getting to know the people you meet and take the time to understand them instead of judging them on a surface level. Together, we can work to prevent snap judgments and build a strong foundation of mutual respect.",1
"There is no denying that modern technology has made life more convenient in many ways. For instance, thanks to technology, we can now communicate with people all over the world in an instant. We can also access a wealth of information at the click of a button.

However, there are also some ways in which life was better when technology was simpler. For one thing, people tended to be more physically active when technology was less advanced. Nowadays, people are more likely to spend their leisure time indoors, in front of a screen. This can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, which can be bad for our health.

Another downside of modern technology is that it can be very distracting. It’s easy to get sucked into our devices and lose track of time. This can make it difficult to focus on tasks and can lead to feelings of anxiety.

In conclusion, there are both positives and negatives to modern technology. It’s important to strike a balance between using technology and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

"Many people believe that children should learn to compete and cooperate in order to have a successful future. There are many reasons why this is thought to be a good idea, and some people believe that children should be taught to compete in order to gain an edge in their field of study. Others believe that children should be taught to cooperate in order to make sure that they are successful in their future endeavors.

There are a few specific examples that show why cooperation is important for children. For example, when children are learning to read, they need to be able to understand the text and make sense of it. This is done by being able to contribute to the group and work together to get the most out of the material. In the same way, children who want to be successful in school need to be able to work together and contribute to the group in order to get the most out of their education.

Overall, I think that children should be taught to compete in order to have a successful future. I think that this is important because it will help them learn how to work together and be successful in their endeavors. I also think that children should be taught to cooperate in order to be successful in their future endeavors. This is important because it will help them learn how to work together and be successful in their endeavors.

"Everything has 2 aspects, so it's not easy to assert something is right or wrong.

What do you think is the best way to live with animals? I think it depends on the situation. For example, if you live in a rural area and you have a lot of animals, you should try to keep them as far away from your house as possible. If you are living in an urban area, then you can keep your animals close to your home, but not so close that they get in the way of your daily life.

"The debate about the use of animal testing in medical research has been raging for decades, and there is no clear-cut answer as to whether it should be acceptable or not. On one hand, people argue that animal testing can help save lives by providing new treatments and cures for diseases more quickly than if humans were tested directly, but on the other hand many feel that using animals to test new drugs and procedures is simply wrong. Despite this controversy though, a closer examination of the subject reveals that while there are some negatives associated with animal testing in medical research, the practice should still be allowed due to its potential benefits. First off, it is worth noting that most tests conducted on animals involve very mild procedures such as giving them small doses of medication or performing blood samples rather than anything extreme like surgical operations. This means pain and suffering are minimized even when tests do cause some level of discomfort for animals involved; additionally scientists put substantial effort into ensuring safety protocols are followed closely so any distress caused is minimized wherever possible. With these safeguards in place it becomes apparent then how valuable animal testing can be – potentially saving countless human lives through providing vital data necessary before clinical trials involving humans can begin. For example numerous important vaccines have been developed thanks largely in part due to data collected from experiments with animals which otherwise would never had happened had those tests not taken place at all – proving just how priceless their contributions can be towards furthering our understanding of medicine today. Furthermore an often-overlooked advantage associated with using animals over direct human experimentation lies within cost savings; costs related to running a single experiment on an animal typically works out cheaper than what might have been required if a patient volunteer was used instead (not least because ethical issues surrounding consent would need resolving first). This then provides resources which could better utilized elsewhere perhaps towards improving existing drug therapies already approved or developing entirely new treatments too - ultimately leading us down paths potentially resulting in life-saving breakthroughs quicker than ever before thought possible.

"As the world continues to try and catch up with modern technology, one industry that has been particularly impacted is the retail sector. With internet shopping becoming more popular and convenient for shoppers all over the globe, physical stores are struggling to remain competitive. This essay will explore how this transition of power from traditional brick-and-mortar stores to online retailers is affecting small business owners who operate within the retail field. The growth of e-commerce has had a major impact on both large stores and smaller businesses alike; as shoppers increasingly head online instead of visiting physical locations in malls or downtown areas. According to recent studies, it was estimated that by 2021 around 95% of purchases would be made through electronic channels such as websites, apps or voice assistants like Amazon Alexa (CNBC). As consumers become more comfortable purchasing everything from groceries to furniture through digital means, local retailers have had no choice but to shift their focus towards web based sales in order to stay afloat financially. However, while larger companies have been able make this change relatively easily due to their access substantial capital reserves and resources they can dedicate towards updating software systems or hiring specialized IT personnel; small business owners don’t always have those same advantages at their disposal which makes transitioning much harder for them. It requires an immense amount of time for these shops’ owners just setting up a website let alone having one with all necessary functions like customer account management system so customers can store their addresses & preferences etcetera (Small Business Resource Center). Additionally many independent retailer lack marketing expertise needed in order attract new customers online since most people tend search on Google before making any purchase decisions (SmallBizTrends). . Undoubtedly some small businesses are taking advantage of various opportunities present in digital marketplaces today ; Indeed platforms such as Etsy allow anyone open a shop without paying any cost upfront which helps level playing field between big brands and individual sellers(Etsy).

"Drivers Should Not Use Cell Phones in Any Capacity While Operating a Vehicle 

In today's society, cell phones have become nearly indispensable for communication and access to information. However, the ubiquitous nature of cell phones has also led to significant risks when used while driving. There are several compelling reasons why drivers should abstain from using cell phones in any way when operating a motor vehicle.

First and foremost, the act of driving requires a person's full attention and focus. Any distraction while driving can potentially lead to accidents that endanger not only the driver but also other people on the road. Talking, texting, or otherwise interacting with a cell phone diverts the driver's eyes from the road as well as their hands from the steering wheel. Even seemingly simple tasks like checking notifications or changing the music can be dangerously distracting at high speeds. 

Scientific studies have shown that driving while using a cell phone reduces reaction times and situational awareness to similar levels as drunk driving. In fact, data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration indicates that cell phone use is a leading factor in car accidents annually. Texting while driving in particular makes a driver 23 times more likely to be involved in a collision. With so much evidence that phones impair driving ability, the risks are simply too high to justify their use behind the wheel.

Allowing any cell phone use also makes it difficult to enforce more restrictive policies against texting or handheld phone conversations. Drivers may claim they were just changing songs or accessing maps when seen on their phones by law enforcement. A total ban creates a clear standard and eliminates loopholes and arguments over what activities are truly ""hands-free."" 

In summary, the dangers of cell phone distractions while driving far outweigh any perceived importance of access to phones. For the safety of all citizens that share the road, drivers must abstain from cell phone use entirely when operating a vehicle. Public safety should be the top priority in deciding responsible policies around this issue.",1
"When one thinks of the Great Lakes, it is hard to imagine that something so vast and powerful could be threatened. But unfortunately, climate change has had a tremendous impact on these beloved freshwater seas in recent decades. Rising temperatures and increased precipitation have led to massive algal blooms, higher levels of nutrient runoff pollution, and more frequent severe storms—all of which threaten human health as well as fish populations. The most acute consequence of climate change on the Great Lakes has been the dramatic increase in algae infestations caused by an influx of phosphorus from agricultural runoff or sewage plants. These infestations create dead zones where oxygen-dependent aquatic life cannot survive; if left unchecked they can also cause widespread damage to entire ecosystems due to their potential for toxic releases into waterways. People may also experience negative health effects when toxins are ingested through contaminated seafood or recreational activities such as swimming and boating in areas with high algal growths. In addition, changes in weather patterns have brought about more extreme weather events like heat waves and floods that can harm fisheries by altering spawning habitats or eliminating food sources needed for survival. Warmer water temperatures can lead to lower dissolved oxygen levels while heavy rains often result in sediment runoff which triggers changes within lake communities by stimulating excessive plant growth while smothering bottom-dwelling creatures essential for maintaining balance among species interactions. The disruption brought about by changing weather patterns also increases water turbidity making it difficult for organisms like zooplankton essential for providing food resources throughout the lakes’ food web to thrive adequately enough sustain other forms of aquatic wildlife dependent upon them as a source energy production too then suddenly collapse when those primary producers are unable longer around anymore either way because everything else needs it all connected together still no matter what happens though right?. Clearly there is much work yet remaining before we come close protecting our precious Great Lakes from future environmental threats posed by global warming but fortunately scientists continue researching solutions both inside out over time suggest

"Limiting car usage has numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. The passages provide examples of communities and cities that have implemented measures to promote alternative transportation and reduce car dependence, and these examples serve as evidence for the benefits of such initiatives.

One major advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in suburban areas where car usage is high. According to the passages, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road and promoting alternative forms of transportation like public transit or cycling, communities can make significant strides in reducing their carbon footprint.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement in air quality. The passages highlight how smog and pollution levels decreased when driving was restricted in Paris and Bogota. These cities experienced a significant decrease in congestion and smog when cars were banned or limited to certain days. This improved air quality has health benefits for residents, as poor air quality can lead to respiratory issues and other health problems.

Limiting car usage also has positive implications for urban planning and city design. The passages mention the concept of ""smart planning,"" where suburbs are designed to be more compact and accessible to public transportation. This includes placing stores and services within walking distance, rather than having them spread out along highways. This type of planning promotes walkability and reduces the need for cars, resulting in more livable and sustainable communities.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. The passages mention how car-free initiatives can lead to the development of alternative transportation infrastructure, such as bike lanes and public transit systems. This can create job opportunities and boost the local economy. Additionally, households that choose to forgo car ownership can save money on car-related expenses like gas, maintenance, and insurance.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, ranging from environmental benefits like reduced greenhouse gas emissions and improved air quality, to improved urban planning and economic benefits. By promoting alternative forms of transportation and implementing measures to reduce car dependence, communities and cities can create more sustainable and livable environments for their residents.",1
"Nowadays, electronic dictionaries (E-dictionaries) have been increasingly popular among students. However, teachers think that the overuse of E-dictionaries might have more disadvantages than advantages for English learning.

There are several reasons why teachers believe that the overuse of E-dictionaries may have more disadvantages than advantages for English learning. One reason is that, like the use of calculator affecting the skill of calculating, reliance on E-dictionaries may lead to the deteriorating of our spelling ability. Another reason is that, since E-dictionaries provide multiple definitions for a word, students may be more likely to choose the wrong definition, which could lead to a misunderstanding of the text. Additionally, using E-dictionaries too often may prevent students from learning how to use a dictionary properly, which is an important skill for English learners.

Despite these potential disadvantages, there are also several reasons why students might find E-dictionaries useful. For example, E-dictionaries are often more up-to-date than traditional dictionaries, and they can provide more information about a word, such as it's origin and usage. Additionally, E-dictionaries can be accessed quickly and easily, which can be helpful when students are working on a writing assignment and need to find a word quickly.

In conclusion, while there are potential disadvantages to relying too heavily on E-dictionaries, there are also several advantages that students can gain from using them. Ultimately, it is up to the individual student to decide whether or not to use an E-dictionary, and teachers should provide students with guidance on how to use E-dictionaries effectively.

"In today's fast-paced world, many people feel stressed and overwhelmed by their work. It is a common belief that work nowadays is more stressful and less leisurely than in the past. I completely agree with this statement, and in this essay, I will provide several reasons to support my opinion.

Firstly, the modern workplace is highly competitive, which puts a lot of pressure on employees. Nowadays, companies are focused on maximizing profits, and they often expect their workers to do more work in less time. This means that employees have to work harder and longer hours, which can lead to burnout and stress-related illnesses. Moreover, job security is becoming less common, and people are often worried about losing their jobs. This creates a stressful working environment that can negatively impact their mental and physical health.

Secondly, technology has dramatically changed the way people work. While technological advancements have made work easier and more efficient, it has also created a culture of constant connectivity. Employees are expected to be available 24/7, and this can create a feeling of being always ""on"". This can lead to stress and anxiety, as people struggle to maintain a work-life balance.

Thirdly, the nature of work has changed, and many people are now engaged in jobs that require high levels of cognitive skills. This means that people are constantly required to think and make decisions, which can lead to mental exhaustion. Moreover, people often have to work in isolation, which can lead to a sense of loneliness and disconnection from others. This can be highly stressful, and it can negatively impact their mental and physical health.

In conclusion, work nowadays is undoubtedly more stressful and less leisurely than in the past. The modern workplace is highly competitive, and employees are expected to work harder and longer hours. Technology has made work more efficient but has also created a culture of constant connectivity. And finally, the nature of work has changed, and many people are now engaged in jobs that require high levels of cognitive skills. This has created a stressful working environment that can negatively impact people's mental and physical health. Therefore, it is crucial to find ways to reduce stress in the workplace and create a healthy work-life balance.

"The Phantom Face on Mars 

Many people see mysteries where there are none. The so-called ""Face on Mars"" is one such case. While its pareidolic shape understandably sparks imaginations, scientific evidence tells us the landform is simply a natural rock formation, not an artifact of aliens. 

Several facts support this conclusion. Firstly, newer photos from 1998 show the face has eroded away over time due to processes like wind erosion. If aliens carved it, why would natural environmental factors wear it down? Its features have changed and faded without purpose or design. Secondly, similar mesa landforms on Mars, devoid of faces, follow the same wind-created patterns as the ""face."" Scientists understand the geological mechanisms that shape rocks into sheer cliffsides and mesas under Martian conditions. The face fits these natural profiles. 

Some argue its symmetrical qualities prove its artificial nature. However, symmetrical rock formations occur throughout our own planet through geologic uplift and weathering alone. Symmetry does not require an intelligent hand. The ""face's"" symmetry has more plausible scientific explanations than alien sculptors. Further, subsequent high resolution images reveal its features are asymmetrical up close, contradicting claims of artificial precision. 

While the human tendency to see faces remains intriguing, extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. No evidence substantiates carved or constructed origins for this mesa. Ultimately, understanding comes through facts, not fantasies. The Face on Mars is best understood as a chance product of ordinary geological processes on another world, not alien visitation. Natural explanations have held up under scientific scrutiny, while alien sculptors remain in the realm of unproven hypothesis. For these compelling reasons, most experts agree the Phantom Face is merely a natural rock formation.",1

"The importance of protecting coral reefs cannot be overstated. They are some of the most biodiverse ecosystems in the world, often providing essential habitats for a variety of marine species including fish, mollusks and crustaceans. Coral reefs also contribute to coastal protection by buffering wave action, promoting shoreline stability and sheltering coastlines from storms and erosion. Unfortunately, however, these underwater formations are facing grave threats due to human activities that can significantly damage their structure or even completely destroy them altogether. One major factor threatening coral reef health is climate change; rising ocean temperatures can cause corals to expel living symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae) from their tissues which results in “coral bleaching” – turning them white as they starve without food sources. This process leaves corals vulnerable to disease leading in many cases to complete death of affected colonies if conditions do not improve quickly enough. In addition acidification caused by increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide has been linked with reduced calcification rates among stony corals resulting in slower growth or even dissolution of structures depending on local water chemistry conditions. Overfishing is another key threat impacting the sustainability of coral reefs; it removes important prey species such as fish that graze on harmful algal blooms keeping these populations under control while simultaneously reducing available food sources for predators like sharks and sea turtles who rely upon them for sustenance. Furthermore bottom trawling used by commercial fisheries causes excessive amounts physical disturbance damaging delicate seabed communities as well as uprooting live organisms like sponges which form important parts within reef systems themselves contributing substantially towards biodiversity and increasing productivity within this environment . . It is thus clear why there needs to be more stringent regulation put into place both nationally and internationally so as better protect our precious coral reefs before further irreversible harm is inflicted upon them or worse still they disappear entirely never again detectable except through memories or photographs taken before any destruction ever occurred at all unfortunately

"When it comes to technology, we have seen an unprecedented amount of advances over the past few decades. The invention and development of artificial intelligence is one such example. Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be defined as machines that are capable of carrying out tasks that would normally require human intelligence or cognitive abilities. AI has had a profound impact on our world—from automating mundane tasks in manufacturing industries, to revolutionizing healthcare by providing diagnostic data with greater accuracy than ever before. In recent years, businesses have begun leveraging AI technologies to improve their operations significantly—increasing efficiency while reducing costs. Banking institutions are utilizing AI-based solutions for fraud prevention, customer service assistance and automated loan approval process; retail companies are using machine learning algorithms for personalization services; and airlines use predictive modeling techniques for maintenance scheduling and route optimization purposes. All these advantages combined make it evident why businesses should consider incorporating AI into their processes—it offers great potential cost savings without sacrificing quality or productivity levels. Yet even with all these improvements brought about by the application of AI in various fields, there remain some ethical concerns regarding its usage in certain scenarios where human decision making is required —for instance when determining whether someone qualifies for social benefits programs or evaluating applications for housing loans etcetera . In such cases relying solely on algorithms may lead to unfair decisions based on biased assumptions which could potentially hurt marginalized individuals disproportionately resulting in further inequality within society at large . Thus it is important to exercise caution while considering utilization of any form of automation so as not to infringe upon basic civil rights , but rather work towards finding balance between implementing efficient technological solutions while also addressing existing socio-economic issues responsibly . Furthermore research needs to be conducted regularly around regulations governing the use of these tools along with public awareness campaigns that focus on encouraging responsible practices among both business owners & users alike . . Overall , although there still exist certain areas where concerns need addressment , artificial intelligence definitely holds multiple opportunities when it comes increasing productivity & efficiency amongst organizations

"In today's fast-paced world, work has become an integral part of our lives. Many people believe that work nowadays is more stressful and less leisurely than in the past. I completely agree with this statement, and in this essay, I will provide specific reasons and examples to support my opinion.

Firstly, the modern work environment is highly competitive, and employees are expected to work longer hours and meet strict deadlines. This leads to increased stress levels and a lack of leisure time. For instance, a recent study conducted by the American Psychological Association found that more than 60% of employees reported feeling stressed at work, and nearly 40% said that their job was negatively affecting their personal life.

Secondly, technological advancements have made work more demanding and less leisurely. With the advent of smartphones and other digital devices, employees are expected to be available 24/7, which means they are unable to switch off from work even during their leisure time. This constant connectivity has led to increased stress levels and a lack of work-life balance.

Finally, the nature of work has changed significantly over the years. In the past, many jobs were manual labor-based, which meant that employees had more physical activity and were able to take breaks throughout the day. However, with the rise of the service sector and desk jobs, employees are required to sit for long periods, which can lead to health problems such as back pain and obesity.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that work nowadays is more stressful and less leisurely than in the past. The competitive work environment, technological advancements, and changing nature of work have all contributed to this trend. It is essential for employers to recognize the negative impact of stress on their employees' health and well-being and take steps to promote a healthy work-life balance.

False praise and hope are powerful tools for educators, as they can instantly boost a student's self-esteem and encourage them to work harder. However, these tools must be used carefully and judiciously, as not all students may respond positively to false praise or hope. False praise, for example, can create false expectations, which can lead to disappointment and feelings of inadequacy or shame. Similarly with hope, it is important to provide only realistic and achievable goals, rather than trying to set unrealistic expectations. 

The best way to build and maintain self-esteem is to promote a sense of deep intrinsic motivation in the student. This is achievable by focusing not just on the outcome, but on the process of learning and striving for something worthwhile. This way, accomplishments and successes become less about achieving a goal and more about propelling the student to learn something new and develop skills and knowledge. At the same time, by nurturing the student's sense of worth and ability to overcome setbacks, educators can help build a strong foundation for self-esteem. 

In conclusion, the best way to build and maintain self-esteem is to focus on helping students develop their intrinsic motivation and sense of worth through learning and striving for something worthwhile. By doing so, educators can foster a lasting sense of self-efficacy and self-esteem that can help them become better learners.",1

One of the biggest problems that students across America face is not enjoying the school lunch offered in the cafeteria. Many students become unenthused with the same meals, and it affects their performance in school. 

After conducting research, it is evident that there are several underlying reasons why students don't like school lunch. Firstly, the quality and the presentation of the food are often subpar; moreover, many school cafeterias lack variety and offer the same selections of meals every day, causing students to develop an aversion to the food. Additionally, the taste is often an issue, as the cafeteria food is usually not very flavorful and for many students, it is not enjoyable to eat. Furthermore, many students are concerned with the nutrition and safety of the cafeteria food.

To make the school cafeteria more appealing to students, the first step is to improve the quality of the food. The menus should be regularly reviewed and changed to make sure that there is enough variety for the students. Schools should also invest in hiring experienced chefs to provide meals that are both nutritious and tasty. Additionally, schools should focus on improving the presentation of the food, as this may make them more attractive and more appetizing to students. Further, schools should also introduce alternative options such as healthier protein bars and smoothies. Finally, parents should be actively involved in the choices being made, as their input is necessary to make the school cafeteria more appetizing and appealing to students.",1

The success of a program in a school can have a significant impact on student relationships, teamwork, and trust. This is especially true when it comes to programs that are designed to foster collaboration and team work. When students are working together towards a common goal, it can lead to relationships that are more collaborative and trusting. Friendships can be formed among students who are part of a successful program, and this relationship can lead to greater collaboration and success outside of the program.

In addition to fostering interpersonal relationships, participating in a program can also encourage teamwork and trust. By working together, students can better communicate their strengths and weaknesses and learn to trust each other. When teams are formed, the value of solidarity and working together towards a common goal increases, allowing everyone to benefit from each other’s unique skills. This trust can carry over to other areas of life and can create a stronger student community.

Finally, participation in a program can also lead to greater self-esteem and confidence. By achieving success as a team, students gain a deeper sense of self-esteem and gain the tools they need to build their team skills and trust in others. This confidence can carry over into other areas of life, such as their relationships with family and friends, or in their abilities inside or outside of the classroom.

"As the world around us continues to change and evolve, so too does the definition of what it means to be successful. Today's society is placing an ever-increasing emphasis on entrepreneurial success, or the ability for individuals to take charge of their own destinies by creating a business from scratch with little more than hard work and dedication. While this type of success has its own appeal, there is something to be said for those who achieve financial stability through regular work rather than a grandiose venture. Furthermore, these successes can often provide much more satisfaction in life if one takes into account all that goes into attaining them. To truly understand how rewarding achieving financial stability through steady employment can be, one must first acknowledge what it entails. This endeavor necessitates discipline and consistency in order to stay afloat financially while simultaneously keeping a job schedule that works best with existing lifestyle needs - both now and potentially further down the line when family obligations are added into the mix. It is not easy; many times balance between responsibilities must be managed carefully as well as time spent networking for new opportunities or improving skills in order to maintain relevance or gain an edge over competitors vying for similar positions. The end result requires adaptability but ultimately offers security; once achieved nearly any future endeavour becomes achievable due to having resources available where otherwise they may have been limited before reaching such levels of fiscal security and prosperity. Beyond just career advancement however lies another component which makes achieving financial stability through consistent work even more satisfying: leaving behind some kind of legacy or being able attain peace within oneself about past decisions made along life’s journey regardless if successful or not at certain points in time leading up until present day conditions were established financially speaking within ones given circumstances . This could take form in different ways depending on individual preferences such as providing greater opportunities for friends/family members whom would benefit greatly from received assistance due prior efforts put forth towards establishing healthier economic foundations via one's regular job endeavors (or lack thereof).

"I believe that the university education is not only to prepare students for employment, but it is also to give students the opportunity to learn about different fields and to develop their skills. For example, a student who attends a university with a business program may learn about accounting and business management. This would give them the opportunity to find a job in a business setting after they graduate, or to start their own business. Additionally, a student who attends a university with a medical program may learn about different medical procedures and how to treat patients. This would give them the opportunity to become a doctor or to work in a hospital after they graduate.

Another function of the university education is to give students the opportunity to learn about different cultures. For example, a student who attends a university with a law program may learn about American law. This would give them the opportunity to work as a lawyer after they graduate, or to become a judge. Additionally, a student who attends a university with a business program may learn about Japanese business practices. This would give them the opportunity to work in a Japanese company after they graduate.

"The Facial Action Coding System is a new technology that can detect human emotions. It's like a computer program that can read your face and know how you're feeling. Some people think it's a good idea to use this technology in classrooms to see how students are feeling. But I don't think it's a good idea.

First of all, it's kind of creepy. Imagine you're sitting in class and the computer is watching your face the whole time. It's like Big Brother is watching you, you know? It's like they're trying to read your mind or something. That's not cool.

And what if the computer gets it wrong? Like, what if it thinks you're mad when you're really just concentrating? Or what if it thinks you're happy when you're really just bored? That could be really embarrassing.

Also, this technology could be used to judge students. Like, if the computer says you're not paying attention, then the teacher might think you're not trying hard enough. Or if it says you're looking sad, then the teacher might think you're not happy in class. That's not fair.

I think it's better to just ask students how they're feeling. Like, a teacher could just ask, ""How's everyone doing today?"" And then we can tell them if we're feeling good or bad. That way, we can talk about it and work it out. It's more personal that way.

So, in conclusion, using the Facial Action Coding System in classrooms is not a good idea. It's creepy, it could be wrong, and it could be used to judge students. Instead, teachers should just ask us how we're feeling and we can talk about it like humans.",1
"Vehicles were invented to help people move around. The first cars were simple and easy to use, and they helped people get around without having to walk. In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.

Some people may argue that this is a good thing, because it will make it easier for people to get around. Others may disagree, because they may find it hard to find a place to park their car. Either way, it is clear that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years.

The drawback to this is that cars will become less useful. They will no longer be able to get around easily, or they may not be able to do so at all. This will make it harder for people to get around, and it could even lead to accidents.

Overall, it is clear that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years. This may not be a bad thing, but it is important to be aware of the potential consequences.

"Animals in captivity have been a source of debate for many years, and one particular species that receives a great deal of attention is the elephant. The issue lies in whether or not these majestic creatures should be kept confined within zoos, circuses, and tourist attractions. On one hand, some people argue that keeping elephants in captivity can be beneficial for both the animal and humans alike—providing an opportunity to observe them up-close while protecting their endangered populations from extinction. Zoos are also able to provide more nutrition than what wild elephants would normally get access to; they are often better managed and given veterinary care on site if needed. Additionally, conservation efforts by breeding programs have seen success over the past few decades. On the other hand, others believe that housing elephants in captivity does more harm than good—keeping these animals away from their natural environments where they can roam freely with their herds and enjoy living as nature intended them to do so. As social animals who require companionship, being alone or having just one or two other individuals with them can lead to mental distress due to isolation; this causes depression which leads further negative effects such as health issues resulting from stress levels being too high for extended periods of time. Furthermore, many experts criticize zoos' limited space size when it comes to caring for elephants properly since this restricts movement which may cause physical problems like arthritis as well as unnatural behaviors such as swaying back and forth due its lack of stimuli available compared to open land where roaming is possible without any boundaries blocking its path. Although there are valid points on both sides surrounding this issue; ultimately it's important to keep our ethical responsibility towards all wildlife at the forefront by considering how our actions affect each individual animal affected - regardless if it be domestic or wild - before making decisions about maintaining practices involving keeping animals locked up against their will no matter how much we think we’re helping them out by doing so simply because we want what’

"Are We Ready for Autonomous Vehicles?. In today's society, we are surrounded by advances in technology that make our lives easier. Autonomous vehicles - or cars and trucks driven by computers rather than humans - could potentially be the next big thing in transportation. This new technology has sparked a debate over whether we are ready for it to become mainstream. On one hand, autonomous vehicles have been proven to reduce accidents caused by human error on the roads and highways. In fact, studies have shown that 94% of all car crashes involve some form of human error such as distracted driving or drunk driving. Eliminating these types of errors with computer-driven automobiles would drastically reduce traffic fatalities across the country. Additionally, fewer collisions mean less time spent stuck in traffic due to accident clean up on roadways; this could save commuters countless hours each year which can then be used more productively elsewhere. . However there are still many unanswered questions about how autonomous vehicles will fit into society when they become more commonplace down the road (no pun intended). For starters, who will be liable if an autonomous vehicle is involved in an accident? Will it be the manufacturer of the car itself? The company responsible for programming its software algorithms? Or perhaps even both parties depending on specific circumstances surrounding any given crash? Furthermore, since autonomous cars rely heavily on sensors like LiDAR and cameras for navigation purposes – what happens if these sensors malfunction or experience technical glitches during operation? These questions must first be answered before introducing self-driving cars onto busy city streets full of pedestrians and cyclists alike. . . On top of safety concerns facing autonmous vehicles is also privacy matters related to their useage. If a person’s car can track their every move via GPS tracking – what kind of data will companies be allowed access to collect from drivers using these kinds devices ? How secure is this data going to stay once collected ? Who owns this information , who has access too it ,

"In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote alternative forms of transportation. This trend can be seen in the examples of Vauban, a German suburb, Paris, and Bogota, Colombia. By limiting car usage, these communities have experienced several advantages, including reduced pollution, improved quality of life, and increased accessibility to public transportation.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions, and this number can go up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By encouraging residents to give up their cars or use them less frequently, these communities are able to significantly lower their carbon footprint. This is particularly important considering the urgent need to combat climate change.

Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to a better quality of life for residents. In Vauban, where cars are generally forbidden, 70% of families do not own cars and 57% sold a car to move to the community. Residents have reported feeling happier and less stressed since giving up their cars. They are able to walk or bike around the community, enjoy the peacefulness of car-free streets, and interact with their neighbors. This sense of community and connection is often lost in car-dependent suburbs.

Furthermore, limiting car usage promotes the use of public transportation and other alternative forms of transportation. In Paris, a partial driving ban was enforced to reduce pollution and congestion. As a result, congestion decreased by 60% and public transit was made free of charge. Bogota, Colombia also implemented a car-free day, during which millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work. These initiatives not only reduce traffic and congestion but also make public transportation more accessible and convenient.

It is worth noting that limiting car usage does not mean completely eliminating cars. In these communities, car ownership is allowed, but there are limited parking spaces available. This encourages residents to use cars as a last resort and prioritize other forms of transportation. It also promotes the idea of sharing vehicles through programs like car-sharing and carpooling, which can further reduce the number of cars on the road.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages. It helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve the quality of life for residents, and increase accessibility to public transportation. The examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota demonstrate the effectiveness of such initiatives in creating more sustainable and livable communities. By embracing smart planning and reducing our dependence on cars, we can work towards a greener and more connected future.",1
"Title: The Benefits of Limiting Car Usage: An Analysis of Global Trends

With the increasing concerns surrounding climate change, pollution, global health, and an overall desire for more sustainable living, societies worldwide are re-evaluating one of the most distinguishing aspects of modern life: car usage. This essay aims to discuss the potential advantages that limitation or even cessation of car usage can bring about by examining real-world examples from Vauban, Germany, Paris, France and Bogotá, Colombia. 

In the German suburb of Vauban, Rosenthal (2009) gives us a glimpse of what a low-car suburb can look like and how its residents thrive without individual vehicle dependence - a lifestyle that just might be the answer to the threat of increasing greenhouse gas emissions and pollution worldwide. The measures taken in Vauban led to 70% of its population giving up car ownership. Furthermore, it shed light on an unexpected advantage: increased peace of mind. A resident confessed leading a much happier life without the constant stress of maintaining and using a car (Rosenthal, 2009).

A partial ban enforced in Paris successfully decreased air pollution and respiratory health hazards by a significant measure, reducing congestion by 60% and bringing under control smog levels which had been akin to highly polluted cities like Beijing (Duffer, 2014). However, it’s important to note the resistance faced by some, as seen in the case of 4000 drivers fined for violation of the ban, suggesting that behavioral and cultural shifts would be an essential part of this transformation.

In Colombia, car-free days have become a cardinal part of public policy, promoting alternative transportation methods, and reducing smog, while massively improving public health. The public participation, as seen in Bogota, suggests better acceptance of such policies, especially when bolstered with improvements in pedestrian spaces and community zones (Selsky, 2002).

In the United States too, an interesting trend has emerged with newer generations driving less, buying fewer cars, and acquiring fewer licenses (Rosenthal, 2013). This cultural shift is indicative of the potential for reduced car-usage, especially when combined with effective policy measures. 

As we move ahead, it's crucial to understand the success of reduced car-reliance isn’t only about changing our transportation choices, but also about reconsidering how we envision our communities. “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg (Rosenthal, 2009). The successful transformation of Vauban, the car-free days of Bogotá, the temporary car ban in Paris, and America's changing driving trends all testify to the feasibility and tangible benefits of a reduced-car world. 

In conclusion, limiting car usage is not merely an environmental issue, but a pathway to sustainable living, improved public health, community building, and rejuvenation of urban spaces. Acceptance and implementation of this change would necessarily involve combined efforts from government, city planners, and citizens. The transition might pose challenges but the benefits are valuable and far-reaching. Redefining mobility holds immense promise for our future.",1
"There are many different opinions on whether education is a life-long process. Some people believe that education is something that should be continuous throughout one's life, while others believe that education is something that can be accomplished in a specific time frame. I believe that education is a life-long process.

One of the main reasons I believe education is a life-long process is because there is always something new to learn. The world is constantly changing and evolving, and new information is being discovered all the time. Even if you think you know everything there is to know about a certain subject, there is always the potential to learn more. Additionally, as you learn new information, you may find that your previous understanding of a subject was inaccurate or incomplete. For example, I recently learned that the Earth is not actually round. I had always been taught that the Earth was a perfect sphere, but it turns out that it is actually an oblate spheroid. If I had not continued learning, I would never have known this new information.

Another reason I believe education is a life-long process is because it is important to keep your mind active and sharp. Just as you need to exercise your body to stay healthy, you need to exercise your mind to stay sharp. Learning new things and expanding your knowledge base can help to keep your mind active and sharp. For example, I have noticed that since I started including more brain-teasing activities in my daily routine, such as puzzles and Sudoku, I have been better able to focus and pay attention.

In conclusion, I believe that education is a life-long process for a variety of reasons. There is always something new to learn, and it is important to keep your mind active and sharp. I think that everyone should make a commitment to lifelong learning in order to stay informed and keep their minds sharp.

"It is often said that knowledge is power, and in the academic world, the acquisition of facts and figures is an important part of the learning process. However, when it comes to the education of students, understanding ideas and concepts is of greater importance than learning facts.

To begin with, understanding ideas and concepts gives students a better understanding of the subject as a whole. For example, if a student is studying biology, they may learn a variety of facts about different organisms. However, it is only by understanding the concepts behind these organisms, such as the role of natural selection in evolution, that the student can gain a deeper understanding of the subject. This understanding is more valuable than simply memorizing facts, as it allows the student to make connections between different areas of the subject and apply their knowledge to real-world situations.

Furthermore, understanding ideas and concepts helps students develop critical thinking skills. By learning to analyse information and draw their own conclusions, students can become more independent in their learning and develop the skills necessary to be successful in their future studies and careers. For instance, a student may be asked to read a text and then provide their own opinion on the topic. In order to do this, they must be able to understand the ideas and concepts presented in the text, and then use this understanding to form their own opinion. This type of critical thinking is more valuable than simply memorizing facts, as it allows the student to think for themselves and make informed decisions.

Finally, understanding ideas and concepts gives students the ability to apply their knowledge in different contexts. For instance, a student may learn about the principles of economics in a classroom setting. However, it is only by understanding the concepts behind these principles, such as supply and demand, that they can apply their knowledge to real-world situations and make informed decisions in their everyday lives. This type of understanding is more valuable than simply memorizing facts, as it allows the student to use their knowledge in a variety of contexts.

In conclusion, it is clear that understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students than learning facts. By understanding the concepts behind the facts, students can gain a deeper understanding of the subject, develop critical thinking skills, and apply their knowledge in different contexts. Therefore, it is essential that students are encouraged to focus on understanding ideas and concepts, rather than simply memorizing facts.

I have always been interested in the field of Psychology. In high school, I had the opportunity to attend a variety of seminars and lectures on the subject and it was one of my greatest sources of inspiration. I am fascinated with the complexity and fascinating human behavior and I am passionate about helping people. Not only does this field provide the opportunity to understand why people think and behave the way they do, but it also offers the potential to help create positive changes in people's lives. In order to pursue this career path, I have been working hard to mature my mind and develop my knowledge and skills that can be applied in this field. Moreover, I have taken the initiative to explore different passions and hobbies that can help me develop a well-rounded personality and be prepared to embark on this journey. With a combination of learning, maturing my mind, and developing my passions, I am confident that I will be able to pursue a career in Psychology.",1
"It is almost universally agreed that the purpose of education is to equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary to lead successful and productive lives. While the memorization of facts is an important part of the learning process, there is a strong consensus among educators and parents that understanding ideas and concepts is even more valuable. I wholeheartedly agree with this assertion and believe that students should place more emphasis on comprehending ideas and concepts than on memorizing facts.

To begin with, understanding ideas and concepts gives students the ability to think critically and analytically. It provides them with the skills to identify patterns, draw logical conclusions, and make informed decisions. This can be invaluable in their future endeavors, as employers increasingly value employees who can think on their feet and solve problems quickly. It also prepares them for higher education, as college courses require a deep understanding of various topics.

Furthermore, understanding ideas and concepts gives students a better appreciation for the world around them. It exposes them to a variety of perspectives and encourages them to consider different points of view. This can be especially beneficial in the increasingly globalized world, as students develop a better understanding of diverse cultures and beliefs. It can also help them better understand and appreciate the nuances of their own culture and beliefs.

Finally, understanding ideas and concepts is an essential part of personal growth and development. It allows students to identify and reflect upon their own values and beliefs, and to explore their own capabilities. This can help them form meaningful relationships, develop healthy habits, and pursue meaningful careers. It can also help them better formulate and pursue their own goals and ambitions.

In conclusion, it is clear that understanding ideas and concepts is far more valuable to students than memorizing facts. It not only prepares them for higher education and future endeavors, but also gives them a better appreciation of the world around them and encourages personal growth and development. Therefore, students should focus more on understanding ideas and concepts than memorizing facts.

"There is no one definitive answer to this question, as people enjoy life in different ways. However, there are a few general reasons why young people may enjoy life more than older people.

First, young people are still in the process of discovering and exploring their own unique talents and abilities. This can be a fun and rewarding process, as it allows them to find their own strengths and weaknesses. As they continue to grow and develop, they may come to appreciate life more fully and appreciate all the unique experiences and moments that life offers.

Second, young people often have more energy and enthusiasm than older people. They are often more engaged in their lives and their surroundings, and they are more likely to be exploring new opportunities and adventures. This can lead to a more vibrant and active lifestyle, which can be enjoyable and rewarding in and of it'self.

Finally, young people often have more optimism and hope for the future. This can be a positive quality, as it can help them to approach life with a positive attitude and outlook.

"The Advantages of Growing Your Own Food. Growing your own food has become an increasingly popular trend in recent years. There are numerous advantages to growing one's own food, from saving money on grocery bills to improving both mental and physical health. From enjoying the freshness of homegrown produce to learning more about conservation practices, there is a range of benefits that come with gardening and harvesting one’s own crops. One major reason why people choose to grow their own food is due to the economic savings they can gain by not having to purchase fruits, vegetables, herbs and other edibles at the store. Gardening has been found to reduce household expenses significantly; those who take the time and effort involved in planting, tending, weeding and harvesting often enjoy fresher produce than what can be bought in a store for less cost overall. In addition, growing one's own food often helps save on transportation costs because locally grown items need not be shipped long distances before reaching consumers' tables. With fewer resources necessary for transporting goods over long distances also comes a reduced environmental footprint — another advantage of gardening that should not be overlooked!. Besides being economical, cultivating plants also offers considerable health benefits since many home gardeners opt for organic or natural methods when it comes their gardens' upkeep. Furthermore, studies have linked regular exposure (and consumption) of green spaces with improved mental well-being — something that could be difficult or impossible without having access or understanding how farming works first-hand. The physical aspect of gardening too brings its rewards in terms of exercise: digging beds; carrying soil amendments; lugging tools around; pulling weeds; pruning branches — all activities which add up throughout each season spent outdoors muscling plants into place require considerable energy expenditure! Gardening provides an excellent way for individuals who might otherwise find exercising tedious or unpleasant a way out given its intrinsically rewarding nature - you get actively healthy while working towards tangible results like improved crop yields as opposed allowing sed

Completing a full four years of high school before moving on to college can help students build essential skills and gain knowledge for their future. For instance, skills such as better time management, organization, writing, and study techniques can be developed over the four year period. This can help students apply these skills to their college courses, eventually translating into better grades and success. 

On the contrary, leaving high school one year earlier than traditional can be challenging. Without the full four-year curriculum, students may lack the exposure to higher level classes needed to perform well in college. Additionally, early graduation can sometimes hinder self-development, as students may miss out on important milestones that could contribute to maturity level and development. 

For example, one student left high school early in order to take a dual-enrollment course at a local college. By not experiencing a full four years of high school, the student lacked the maturity level and knowledge needed to succeed in college academics. As a result, her grades began to suffer.

It is clear that while leaving high school early can be appealing to some, it is important to consider the effects it may have on a student's future. Taking the four year high school experience can help them prepare for the rigors of college by developing crucial skills and knowledge, while also allowing them to build maturity and grow into adulthood.",1
"The influence of technology on communication is an important topic to consider in today's world. Technology has revolutionized how people interact with each other, enabling them to communicate across great distances, and even through time. These advancements have enabled us to bridge gaps that seemed unfathomable before the age of technology. Today, we can send messages and images instantaneously through various digital devices like smartphones or computers, drastically increasing the speed at which we can interact. This ability has allowed us to connect with friends and family no matter where they are located in the world without having a physical presence for a conversation - something that was previously impossible only decades ago.

Subject: In Defense of the Electoral College

Dear [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and to urge you to consider the benefits it provides in our presidential elections. While many argue for a change to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College is a necessary and effective method that upholds the principles of our Founding Fathers.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome in our elections. As stated by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. This system reduces the chances of disputes over the election results and provides a clear winner while maintaining the integrity of the process.

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that every region of our country has a say in electing the president. Unlike a popular vote system, where candidates may focus solely on highly populated areas, the Electoral College requires candidates to have trans-regional appeal. This system ensures that no region, regardless of its size, is overlooked, and encourages candidates to campaign nationwide, ultimately leading to a more representative and inclusive democracy.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it promotes the importance of swing states. In recent elections, we have seen candidates strongly focusing their campaigns on these states, engaging and informing voters. This strategy ensures that the most thoughtful and engaged voters have a greater influence on the outcome of the election. By emphasizing the importance of toss-up states, the Electoral College encourages candidates to address the concerns and needs of a diverse range of Americans.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that larger states receive the attention they deserve. While the Constitution's mal-apportionment of the Senate gives smaller states disproportionate power, the Electoral College helps rebalance this disparity. It allows candidates to earn more electoral votes by winning the popular vote in larger states, ensuring that larger states have a stronger impact on the election outcome.

Lastly, the Electoral College serves to avoid the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College invariably produces a clear winner. This eliminates the complications and costs associated with organizing additional elections and prevents potential instability in the electoral process.

Opponents argue that the Electoral College disenfranchises voters by limiting the impact of individual votes. However, turnout rates in our elections show that voters are motivated to express their political preferences, even if their state is likely to go a certain way. The Electoral College does not deter active participation in the political process but rather ensures that each state's unique interests are represented.

In conclusion, the Electoral College upholds the principles of our Constitution and serves to protect the interests of all Americans. It provides certainty in the outcome of elections, promotes trans-regional appeal, emphasizes the importance of swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and prevents the need for run-off elections. It is a practical system that should be retained to ensure the integrity and fairness of our presidential elections.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter. I trust that you will make an informed decision that takes into account the best interests of our great nation.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"There is no denying that facts are important. They provide the foundation upon which concepts and ideas are built. However, I believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts.

Facts are, by definition, objective and unchanging. They are like building blocks, and they are essential for constructing knowledge. However, once the basic facts have been learned, it is more important for students to focus on understanding ideas and concepts. This is because ideas and concepts are what help us make sense of the world and solve problems.

For example, consider the fact that the earth is round. This is an important fact to know, but it is not as important as understanding the concept of gravity. Once students understand the concept of gravity, they can use that knowledge to solve problems, such as how to launch a satellite into orbit. If they only knew the fact that the earth is round, they would not be able to solve this problem.

Of course, there are some facts that are so important that they must be memorized, such as the periodic table of elements. However, even in this case, it is more important for students to understand the concepts behind the periodic table than to simply memorize the names and symbols of the elements. Once students understand the concepts, they will be able to use that knowledge to solve problems, such as designing new materials or predicting the properties of unknown substances.

In conclusion, while facts are important, I believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts. This is because ideas and concepts are what help us make sense of the world and solve problems.

School is an invaluable opportunity to learn valuable lessons that can stay with us throughout our lives. One of the most important lessons students can learn at school is how to think critically and objectively. Understanding critical thinking can help students develop better problem-solving skills, make more informed decisions, and ultimately contribute to more successful outcomes in their future endeavors.

Critical thinking in the classroom teaches students to think beyond what is being presented to them and to challenge assumptions and ideas. With the help of teachers, students learn how to evaluate various sources of information, identify multiple perspectives on an issue, and weigh the evidence to arrive at a reasonable conclusion. This can make them better informed citizens, better prepared in their jobs, and better able to participate in critical conversations.

Learning how to think critically is also important because it helps us develop our own independent thought processes and strengthen our ability to make our own judgments. It encourages a sense of curiosity and exploration and allows us to better analyze existing data objectively to draw our own conclusions about the world around us. This can help us become more confident and independent learners, which can help us in our future studies and careers.

Ultimately, developing critical thinking skills is an essential life skill that can benefit students in their future. It can help them to better make decisions, more effectively participate in critical conversations, and confidently navigate various challenges they may face in their lives.",1
"The importance of taking regular breaks in the workplace cannot be overstated. Whether it’s a coffee break, lunch or even just to get up and walk around for a few minutes, giving yourself time away from your desk can have many positive benefits both physically and mentally. Physically, regular breaks give your body and eyes the chance to rest after long hours sitting at the computer. Taking short walks throughout the day can help ward off aches and pains associated with extended periods of sitting down. They also allow you to step away from your work so that when you do come back to it, you will have refreshed ideas and more energy for tackling whatever task lies ahead. Additionally, some studies suggest that taking regular breaks may lead to increased productivity overall as well as greater job satisfaction due to feeling less overwhelmed by workloads. . Mentally speaking, taking frequent breaks gives us an opportunity to reset our minds which often helps us approach problems with fresh perspectives that are not clouded by stress or frustration arising from prolonged concentration on difficult tasks. It is during these pauses where we can practice mindfulness techniques such as breathing exercises or meditation which can further help reduce anxiousness while increasing creativity levels resulting in better problem solving skills in high-pressure situations where quick decisions need to be made efficiently without compromising quality output results. . Overall then, incorporating brief but meaningful moments of respite into our daily routines should be regarded as essential components in any successful work environment if employees are expected perform at their best on a consistent basis; whether they are virtual workers operating remotely via laptop computers or office staff who must observe social distancing regulations due physical proximity restrictions caused by current pandemic conditions worldwide .

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Over the years, there has been a growing trend in various parts of the world to limit car usage in order to promote smarter planning, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and create more sustainable communities. This shift in thinking has led to the development of car-free neighborhoods, driving bans due to pollution, and initiatives like car-free days. By limiting car usage, we can experience several benefits that positively impact our environment and overall quality of life.

One major advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. It is widely known that passenger cars are a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, for example, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of these emissions. By reducing our dependency on cars, we can significantly decrease these emissions and contribute to the fight against climate change. This is especially crucial in car-intensive areas in the United States, where cars account for up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions.

In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, limiting car usage has several positive effects on public health. Car-free neighborhoods and initiatives like car-free days create an environment that promotes walking, biking, and the use of public transportation. This active lifestyle helps to combat sedentary behavior and its associated health problems, such as obesity and cardiovascular disease. By encouraging more physical activity, we can improve the overall health and well-being of our communities.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of traffic congestion. Suburbs that are designed with smart planning principles, like Vauban in Germany, have seen a significant decrease in traffic. Without cars on the streets, these neighborhoods become more accessible for pedestrians and cyclists. As a result, there is less congestion and more freedom of movement. This not only saves time for residents but also contributes to a safer and more enjoyable neighborhood environment.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more sustainable and compact communities. By placing stores within walking distance and implementing better public transportation systems, we can reduce the need for long-distance car travel. This new approach to community development allows for more efficient land use and reduces the reliance on cars as the primary mode of transportation. As a result, we can create more livable neighborhoods that prioritize human connection and sustainability.

In conclusion, there are several advantages to limiting car usage. By doing so, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve public health, decrease traffic congestion, and create more sustainable communities. With the growing recognition of the negative impacts of car culture, it is important to embrace alternatives and work towards a future that is less dependent on cars. In doing this, we can create a healthier, greener, and more enjoyable environment for all.",1
"The number of cars in use today is about the same as it was in the early 1900s. However, in the next twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today because the number of cars has been declining steadily since the early 1900s.

There are a number of reasons for this decline. One reason is that the number of cars has been increasing at a rate that is not sustainable. The average car is only able to travel about 30 miles per hour, which is not enough to cover the distance needed to get from one place to another.

Another reason for the decline in the number of cars is that the cars are not being replaced as quickly as they are being replaced. The average car is only able to last about 10 years before it needs to be replaced. This means that the number of cars in use today is not going to be very high in the next twenty years.

"In the wake of our growing concern for the environment and our personal health and wellbeing, it is paramount that we reconsider our reliance on cars. Communities across the globe are showcasing the benefits of restricting automobile usage. These range from creating cleaner environments, promoting healthier lifestyles, reducing traffic congestion, and potentially facilitating an intriguing social dynamic shift away from the car-centered culture.

In Vauban, Germany, for example, residents have embraced a car-free lifestyle out of choice. In this suburban community, car ownership is restricted, with parking spots available only at the periphery and bought separately from the homes at a substantial cost of $40,000 (Rosenthal, Passage 1). This deliberate design has successfully deterred car ownership, with 70 percent of Vauban's residents not owning cars. Notably, residents have reported being happier with the tranquillity that the lack of cars brings (Rosenthal, Passage 1).

Other communities have embraced car-free lifestyles more out of necessity than choice, but with equally beneficial outcomes. In Paris, the government enforced a partial car banning due to extreme smog conditions brought about primarily by vehicular emissions (Duffer, Passage 2). And in Bogota, Colombia, a mandatory “Day Without Cars” resulted in an eerily serene environment (Selsky, Passage 3). The necessity in both these cases perhaps underscores the urgency of our situation. 

More importantly, these measures are not just momentary solutions but could potentially signal a long-term cultural shift. The United States has seen a decrease in car ownership per household, driving mileage per person, as well as a drop in young persons getting licenses (Rosenthal, Passage 4). Alongside this phenomenon, there seems to be a growing acceptance of alternative transportation methods as companies and city authorities invest more in public transportation systems and bike-sharing programs.

Environmental advantages are apparent from these examples of restricted car usage. Reduction in air pollution is an immediate benefit, as seen in the cases of Paris and Bogota, where vehicle restrictions were enforced primarily to combat smog. In the broader context, a global shift away from a car-dominated culture could significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a significant portion of which are attributed to passenger cars (Rosenthal, Passage 1).

Health benefits also come with limiting car usage. In communities like Vauban, bicycles and walking replace cars, encouraging physical activity and fostering healthier lifestyles. Notably, reducing car usage may lessen stress levels, an outcome reported by Vauban’s residents (Rosenthal, Passage 1).

The advantages of limiting car usage are compelling, promoting environmental and personal health benefits alongside a promising cultural shift. This shift represents a move towards more sustainable living and could pave the way to a greener, healthier future. However, wide-scale adoption would require a conscious effort, deliberate planning, and progressive policymaking from governments, communities, and individuals alike. We should, therefore, look towards embracing this shift, phasing out our reliance on cars, and seeking healthier, more sustainable alternatives.",1
"There are a few different ways to look at education. It can be seen as a process that begins when a person is very young and continues throughout their life. It can also be seen as something that happens during a specific period, such as when someone is attending school.

I believe that education is a life-long process. This is because there are always new things to learn. Even if you are not formally attending school, there are always opportunities to learn new things. For example, you can learn new skills from books, online courses, or by working with someone who is more experienced than you.

In addition, I believe that education is a life-long process because it is not always about learning new information. It is also about expanding your understanding of the world and how it works. As you learn new things, you can start to see the world in different ways. This can help you make better decisions in your life.

Overall, I believe that education is a life-long process because it is always possible to learn new things and because it is about more than just learning new information.

"Computer games have become a popular pastime for children in recent years. While some people argue that computer games have produced more negative effects than positive ones on children's physical, intellectual and psychological development, I disagree with this opinion.

First of all, computer games can help children to develop their physical skills. For example, many computer games require players to use their hands to control the characters on the screen. This can help children to improve their hand-eye coordination and fine motor skills. Additionally, some computer games also require players to move their bodies to control the characters. This can help children to exercise and improve their physical fitness.

Second, computer games can also help children to develop their intellectual skills. For example, many computer games require players to think strategically and make decisions quickly. This can help children to improve their problem-solving skills and analytical thinking. Additionally, some computer games also require players to learn new concepts and skills. This can help children to expand their knowledge and understanding.

Finally, computer games can also help children to develop their psychological skills. For example, many computer games require players to interact with other players. This can help children to improve their social skills and communication skills. Additionally, some computer games also require players to manage their emotions and cope with failure. This can help children to develop their emotional intelligence and resilience.

In conclusion, I disagree with the opinion that computer games have produced more negative effects than positive ones on children's physical, intellectual and psychological development. On the contrary, computer games can help children to develop their physical, intellectual and psychological skills. Therefore, instead of preventing children from playing computer games, parents should encourage them to play computer games in a healthy and balanced way.

"There are a few things that can help to make a product seem much better than it actually is. One example is when an advertiser uses exaggerated or false images to make a product seem more attractive or valuable than it actually is. Another example is when an advertiser uses exaggerated or false statements to make a product seem more effective than it actually is.

In general, I believe that exaggerating or false statements can often lead to a product being seen as much better than it actually is. For example, many people believe that caffeine is a good source of energy. However, caffeine is actually a very harmful drug, and can actually cause many problems such as heart disease and stroke. In contrast, many people believe that olive oil is a good source of oil. However, olive oil is actually a very unhealthy oil, and can even be dangerous for your skin.

In conclusion, exaggerating or false statements can often lead to a product being seen as much better than it actually is. This can be dangerous because people may believe that the product is better than it actually is.

"As technology continues to evolve, the way we communicate with each other has drastically changed. Social media is a major influence in our everyday lives and it's hard to imagine life without it. From sharing information about ourselves to connecting with people from all over the world, social media has become an integral part of our culture. However, this increased reliance on technology can also have a negative impact on human interaction. Nowadays, more and more people are choosing digital communication methods over face-to-face interactions when it comes to maintaining relationships or networking. Although online conversations are convenient and can facilitate meaningful connections between individuals who may be far away from each other geographically speaking, there’s something special about genuine physical contact that cannot be replicated through a computer screen or phone call. Studies show that physical contact releases oxytocin—a hormone associated with trust, empathy and emotional bonding—which helps us form strong attachments to one another. Therefore, although digital conversations might provide some basic forms of connection they still lack the intimacy brought by real-life interactions which could lead to future issues concerning mental health problems such as depression or anxiety caused by feeling disconnected from others due to lack of face-to-face contact or social skills development deficits in young adults coming up in an increasingly digital age where communication often takes place over text messages rather than conversations around dinner tables at home . In order for us not only maintain healthy relationships but also ensure proper psychological development within society , I believe we should strive for balance between virtual interaction platforms like social media and traditional means such as meeting up with friends face -to -face . These physical meet ups have proven benefits psychologically beyond just having fun together , providing essential hormones required for building trust as well as strengthening personal bonds among those involved . Thus , while utilizing modern technological advances is important for self improvement , networking opportunities or even work related tasks ; ensuring everyone regularly spends time interacting physically alongside their peers is crucial for overall mental wellbeing .

"There are many reasons why young people enjoy life more than older people do. One reason is that young people are more mobile and have more opportunities to explore the world. They also have a more positive outlook on life and are more likely to believe in the power of positive change.

Another reason why young people enjoy life more is that they are more likely to be engaged in their communities. They are more likely to volunteer, participate in social clubs, and take part in activities that make a difference in the world. This is especially true in countries like the United States, where young people have a high level of engagement with their communities.

Finally, young people are more likely to be happy with their lives. They are more likely to have positive outlooks on life and are more likely to believe in the power of positive change. This makes them more likely to be content and happy with their lives.

"The debate over whether children should learn to compete or cooperate is an ongoing one. While some argue that competition can help prepare children for the real world, others believe that cooperation is the key to success. In my opinion, children should be taught to cooperate rather than compete. In this essay, I will explain my reasoning.

First and foremost, cooperation helps children develop social skills. When children work together, they learn to communicate effectively, share ideas, and compromise. These are essential skills that will serve them well throughout their lives. In contrast, competition can sometimes lead to hostility and resentment between children, which can be detrimental to their social development.

Secondly, cooperation can foster a sense of community and empathy in children. When children learn to work together towards a common goal, they develop a sense of camaraderie and mutual support. They learn to celebrate each other's successes and help each other through obstacles. This fosters a sense of empathy and compassion that is sorely needed in today's world.

Finally, cooperation can lead to better outcomes than competition. When children work together, they can pool their resources and talents to achieve more than they could on their own. In contrast, competition can sometimes lead to a ""winner takes all"" mentality, where the focus is on defeating others rather than achieving a common goal. This can limit creativity and innovation.

To illustrate my point, let's consider a hypothetical example. Imagine two groups of children are given the task of building a tower out of blocks. One group is encouraged to compete against the other, while the other group is encouraged to work together. The competitive group may be more motivated at first, but in the end, their tower will likely be shorter and less stable than the tower built by the cooperative group. The competitive group may have spent more time trying to sabotage each other than focusing on building the tower.

In conclusion, while some argue that children should learn to compete, I believe that cooperation is the better approach. Cooperation helps children develop social skills, empathy, and a sense of community. It also leads to better outcomes than competition. Ultimately, the world needs more cooperation and less competition, and teaching children to work together is a step in the right direction.

Extending the school day could have drastic effects on both the students and the teachers. For students, it could mean added physical and mental fatigue due to the increased time in the classroom. It could be difficult for students to maintain a healthy balance between school and their personal lives. For teachers, the extra hours of work could lead to increases in stress and workload. It is important to consider the implications that an extended school day could have on both the students and the teachers before making a decision. To address any potential issues, it may be necessary to provide additional support, such as extra funding for teacher aid or extended breaks for students. With the right support, the extended school day could be beneficial to all involved.",1
"It is often said that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. While there is some truth to this statement, I disagree with it overall. In fact, I believe that young people are more involved in helping their communities than ever before.

To begin with, young people are more likely to volunteer and take part in community service activities than in the past. This is due to the fact that many schools now require students to complete a certain number of hours of community service in order to graduate. This requirement encourages young people to get involved in their communities and to give back. For example, many high school students volunteer at local food banks, homeless shelters, and other charitable organizations. Additionally, many college students participate in service trips to help those in need in other countries.

Furthermore, young people are more likely to be politically active than in the past. This is due to the fact that many young people are passionate about social justice and are eager to make a difference in their communities. For instance, young people are often at the forefront of movements such as the Black Lives Matter movement and the climate change movement. They are also more likely to vote in elections and to get involved in local politics.

Finally, young people are more likely to use technology to help their communities than in the past. For example, many young people use social media to raise awareness about important issues and to encourage others to get involved in their communities. Additionally, many young people use crowdfunding platforms to raise money for causes that they are passionate about.

In conclusion, I believe that young people are more involved in helping their communities than ever before. They are more likely to volunteer and take part in community service activities, to be politically active, and to use technology to help their communities. Therefore, I disagree with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities.

"The debate over whether a society should prioritize it's own success or the well-being of it's citizens is one that has been discussed for many years. While some may argue that a society should prioritize it's own success, I believe that the well-being of it's citizens should be the primary focus. In my opinion, a society can only truly succeed when it's citizens are able to lead happy, healthy, and prosperous lives. 

For a society to be successful, it is important for it's citizens to feel secure and safe. For it's citizens to feel secure, the government needs to provide adequate resources and services such as healthcare, education, and housing. Research shows that citizens in countries with good quality healthcare and education are more likely to live longer, healthier lives, and have better job opportunities. In contrast, countries with poor social services tend to have higher levels of poverty and crime. Furthermore, a society will only thrive if it's citizens are able to work and participate in the economy. For this to happen, citizens need to have access to employment opportunities, and a safe and supportive work environment. Unless citizens are able to work and make a living, they will not be able to contribute to the development and progress of the society. 

Apart from providing resources and services, a successful society also needs to prioritize the well-being of it's citizens by protecting their rights and freedoms. This includes protecting freedom of expression, allowing citizens to practice their own beliefs and cultures, as well as protecting them from discrimination and violence. Without these basic human rights, citizens would be unable to participate in society and it's development. Additionally, a society should also promote social justice and equality, as this will ensure that all citizens have an equal opportunity to succeed, regardless of race, gender, or class. 

In conclusion, I believe that a society must prioritize the well-being of it's citizens in order to be successful. Providing resources and services, protecting rights and freedoms, and promoting justice and equality are all essential for citizens to lead happy, healthy, and prosperous lives, which are essential for the overall success of a society.

"Senator [Your Senator's Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and spirits. As a concerned and considerate citizen of our state, I write this letter to urge you to consider the continuation of the Electoral College. As outlined in the U.S Constitution, the founding fathers in their wisdom saw it fit to craft this mechanism as a compromise between the popular vote and congress vote (Passage 1). I implore you to uphold this currently embattled institution in lieu of the popular vote.

I acknowledge the arguments in favor of the popular vote. The unfairness of the winner-take-all method in most states and the overly emphasizing on swing states leave some voters feeling unheard (Passage 13). Also, the potential for ""faithless"" electors to defy the popular will or a tie in electoral votes seem to be reasons to abolish the Electoral College (Passage 11). However, the Electoral College continues to serve critical roles in our democracy that can potentially erode with the installment of a popular vote system.

The most compelling argument in favor of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome (Passage 18). It lessens the probability of a dispute over election results, as witnessed in 2000 when disputes over the popular vote did not reflect distinctly in the electoral vote. In addition, it requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, preventing a candidate from being overly popular in a single region and maintaining a balanced political landscape (Passage 19). Furthermore, it accounts for the disproportionate representation in the Senate by giving more weight to bigger states (Passage 21), and it diminishes the requirement for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the popular votes (Passage 22). 

I concede to the fact that the Electoral College system may seem undemocratic, but it ensures a just representation across all states, regardless of their size or population (Passage 15). The U.S. isn't merely a democracy; it's a federalist system where the states, not just the people, need to have a say in the election process. The Electoral College protects this decentralization.

As Senator to our great state of [Your State's Name], I implore you to stand against the wave that seeks to abolish the Electoral College. Uphold the effort to foster regional balance in the electoral system and ensure that candidates seek a broad, nationwide appeal, instead of becoming mere regional favorites. Your work in defending the Electoral College is essential to ensuring that our democracy remains balanced, representative, and prevents an overly amplified voice from populous areas.

Thank you for your service to our state and for taking the time to consider my thoughts on this very crucial issue.

Sincerely,

[Your Full Name]

"The importance of a college education cannot be overstated. The value of an education is becoming increasingly clear in today's world, and having a degree from an accredited institution gives people numerous advantages that they may not have had without one. For example, college graduates often find themselves at the head of the job market with potential employers actively seeking their skills and abilities due to the level of specialized knowledge they possess. Furthermore, those with a college degree are likely to make more money on average than those without one over the course of their career. Attaining a college degree doesn't come easy either; it requires dedication and hard work from the student to succeed in their studies. The rigor and discipline needed for advanced courses can be quite intense, requiring students to stay organized with projects as well as manage their time effectively if classes are taken online or part-time during off-peak hours. Additionally, balancing schoolwork along with possible outside commitments such as family responsibilities or jobs can create its own set of challenges for any student no matter how motivated they may be towards success in academics. In addition to providing economic benefits, higher learning also greatly contributes to personal growth by enabling individuals to become experts in whatever field interests them most through rigorous research and development projects conducted at universities around the globe every day (often leading directly into new job opportunities). Having access to reliable academic resources allows students gain insight into complex topics while networking with likeminded peers provides invaluable support systems both inside and outside class settings which can ultimately lead towards productive collaborations even beyond graduation itself!. Overall then there is much evidence pointing towards highly beneficial returns when investing in tertiary education whether this comes via traditional university study or alternative methods such as internships/apprenticeships within specific industries which provide valuable real world experience regardless - all these avenues have significant potential outcomes that could help anyone reach greater heights professionally while developing valuable life skills along way too!

"When discussing the topic of sustainable farming, it is important to note its impact on both environmental and economic aspects. Sustainable farming practices refer to methods that combine traditional approaches with modern innovations in order to reduce environmental harm while simultaneously increasing efficiency and profitability. The core principle behind sustainable farming is maintaining or improving soil quality while remaining financially viable. This means employing techniques such as crop rotation, cover cropping, intercropping, reduced tillage and integrated pest management that help conserve natural resources like water, air and energy while also creating a healthy environment for crops. Additionally, conservation tillage systems can significantly reduce fuel consumption by minimizing trips across the farm field which cuts down the amount of carbon dioxide emissions released into the atmosphere from tractors and other equipment used for agricultural purposes. Moreover, these systems have resulted in improved soil fertility due to fewer nutrient losses from runoff or wind erosion leading to higher yields over time. In terms of economics, sustainable farming practices produce greater returns than conventional methods by using less labor costs since they require less manpower per acre compared with more intensive processes such as chemical fertilizers or pesticides which are expensive investments up front. Furthermore, increased yields mean larger profits for farmers who adopt more efficient production systems without sacrificing their land’s sustainability over time – something many traditional approaches fail at doing successfully due to excessive use of synthetic inputs which only serve short-term gains but long-term detriment when it comes to depleting essential nutrients from soils faster than they can be replenished naturally through organic matter creation processes like composting etc. . As global populations continue rising each year there is an urgent need for our planet’s agricultural lands to become sustainably managed in order maintain its natural bounty long into future generations so that everyone may benefit both environmentally and economically alike - this makes sustainable agriculture one of humanity's most critical tasks today!

"Education is a fundamental aspect of human life. It is a process that enables individuals to acquire knowledge, skills, and values necessary for their personal and professional development. However, the question of what is more important for students to learn, ideas and concepts or facts, has been a subject of debate for years. While some people argue that students should focus more on learning facts, others believe that understanding ideas and concepts is more crucial. In my opinion, it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. In this essay, I will explain why I hold this view.

Firstly, understanding ideas and concepts enables students to apply their knowledge in various situations. When students learn ideas and concepts, they gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter. They can analyze and evaluate information critically, which allows them to apply their knowledge in different contexts. For example, if a student understands the concept of supply and demand, they can use it to explain market behavior, pricing strategies, and consumer behavior. This knowledge is more valuable than memorizing a list of facts about supply and demand.

Secondly, learning ideas and concepts helps students to develop critical thinking skills. Critical thinking is an essential skill that enables individuals to evaluate information, analyze arguments, and make informed decisions. When students learn ideas and concepts, they are encouraged to think critically and to ask questions. This process helps them to develop analytical skills and to become more independent learners. For instance, when students learn about the scientific method, they are taught to question assumptions, gather evidence, and draw conclusions. These skills are essential for success in any field.

Finally, understanding ideas and concepts helps students to retain information better. When students learn facts, they are often required to memorize a large amount of information. However, this approach does not promote long-term retention of information. On the other hand, when students learn ideas and concepts, they are encouraged to connect information to prior knowledge, which enhances their ability to retain information. For example, if students learn about the concept of photosynthesis, they can relate it to their prior knowledge of plant biology, which helps them to retain the information better.

In conclusion, learning ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts. Understanding ideas and concepts enables students to apply their knowledge in various situations, develop critical thinking skills, and retain information better. While facts are essential, they are only valuable when they are connected to ideas and concepts. Therefore, educators should focus on teaching students ideas and concepts that will enable them to become independent learners and critical thinkers.

"There is no one right way to be successful, as the best way to achieve success depends on what you are looking for and what you are willing to do to obtain it. However, there are some common traits that successful people share, such as being willing to try new things and take risks.

Many successful people have had to overcome considerable obstacles in their journey to success. They have had to work hard, often starting from scratch, and often facing rejection and setbacks. They have had to learn new skills, take on new challenges, and persevere through difficult times.

Successful people are not afraid to change their approach if they believe it will lead to success. They are not afraid to take risks, as they know that sometimes these risks will pay off and sometimes they will not. However, they are always willing to learn from their mistakes and move on.

Some of the most successful people in history have been willing to take risks and try new things. For example, Thomas Edison was a prolific inventor who developed many groundbreaking technologies, but he was also known for his willingness to take risks and try new ideas. Similarly, Bill Gates is one of the richest men in the world and a pioneer in the computer industry, but he is also known for his willingness to take risks and experiment with new ideas.

Successful people are not afraid to change their approach if they believe it will lead to success.

Many successful people have also been known for their intelligence and their ability to think analytically. They are not afraid to ask difficult questions and to challenge conventional wisdom. They are also not afraid to take risks, as they know that sometimes these risks will pay off and sometimes they will not.

However, despite their intelligence and their willingness to take risks, successful people are not always successful. There are many factors that contribute to success, and it is not always easy to achieve success. Successful people are often determined and motivated, but they are not always lucky. They are always willing to work hard, but they are not always able to achieve their goals overnight.

In conclusion, successful people are not afraid to try new things and take risks, as this is one of the key traits that defines them. They are determined and motivated, and they are not always successful, but this is not always due to lack of effort or determination.

"In a world of constant technological advancement and changing societal norms, it is easy to forget about the importance of traditional family values. The commitment to uphold certain cultural beliefs passed down from generation to generation have been proven time and time again as an integral part of what makes a successful society. As such, it is vital that we continue to prioritize these values in our own lives today. Family values such as respect, empathy and understanding are essential for creating strong relationships within families. Respect for one another creates an atmosphere where family members can express their thoughts openly without fear of judgement or criticism. Empathy encourages us to appreciate each other's experiences and perspectives while understanding allows us to better relate with one another despite any differences we may have with one another’s opinions or views on life. In this way, family values serve as the tie that binds all generations together by strengthening communication between them which helps build trust over time. It is also important that these traditional values be respected outside of the home environment so they can be adopted into wider community circles and ultimately become more widely accepted around the world. This is especially true when considering how much emphasis has recently been placed on individualism rather than collective action which has caused many families to drift apart emotionally from each other due lack of shared goals or bonding moments due work commitments or busy schedules. Additionally, teaching children about traditional family values has a number of positive implications ranging from improved mental health outcomes for individuals who practice them regularly, lessening issues related delinquent behaviour among adolescents who understand their obligations towards others in society or increasing academic performance as students learn valuable lessons about problem solving skills through familial interactions at a younger age instead relying solely on digital media sources for advice later in life . All things considered, although technology provides many conveniences which make life easier in certain ways; it cannot replace the beneficial aspects associated with practicing traditional family values outright since those come only through human interaction alone forged by genuine emotional bonds between generations united by passion rather

There are many reasons for this. One reason is that cities are much more efficient and livable than rural areas. Cities have more public transportation, which makes it easy to get around. They also have more restaurants and cafes, which make it easy to get food. Additionally, cities are much more walkable than rural areas. This means that you can get to most places you need to go without having to drive.

"The confluence of technology and art is a fascinating topic. It has long been debated whether or not technology can truly be considered an artistic medium, with some arguing that it lacks the creative impulse of traditional arts like painting and sculpture. However, when looking at the history of mankind’s use of technological tools to create works of beauty, one can see why this argument may be incorrect. Throughout history, from ancient Egypt to modern times, humans have used various technologies - from simple tools to complex machines - in order to produce aesthetically pleasing objects for both utilitarian and aesthetic purposes. In today’s age where digital devices are ubiquitous in everyday life, traditional art forms have seen a resurgence in popularity due to the availability of digital tools such as 3D printing and photo manipulation software which allow users unprecedented levels control over their creations. With these new capabilities for creating artwork come challenges though; how can we ensure that the work created through these means accounts for ethical considerations such as privacy protection? Additionally, one must consider what effects technological advancements will have on traditional modes of artistic expression – will they lead to more creative freedom or simply enable people with greater access to resources?. These questions all point towards an intriguing discussion surrounding creativity within our high-tech world: Are artists better off because they now have access to powerful computing power unavailable before? Does this mean that potential creators no longer need technical knowledge nor experience working with their hands in order gain skills? Or conversely could relying too heavily on automation eliminate certain aspects unique quality found only within handmade pieces crafted by skilled craftsmen?. Whether or not technology should be classified as an “art form” ultimately remains open for debate however there is no doubt that its influence on aesthetics cannot be ignored; it is clear that technology has played a major role throughout human history when it comes expressing ourselves artistically.

"The modern trend of minimalism has been gaining traction in the world of interior design. From the simplicity of Scandinavian-inspired furniture to a return to classic and timeless pieces, this minimalist style has many advantages that are ideal for any space. Minimalist designs tend to focus on open spaces, clean lines, and neutral colors which can help create a sense of calmness and order within an area. This type of minimalism is perfect for those who are looking for a way to declutter their home without sacrificing comfort or aesthetic appeal. Additionally, it uses fewer materials than traditional styles so it can be more affordable as well as eco-friendly. One great thing about minimalist interior design is its versatility – it works equally well with traditional homes or contemporary apartments while still creating visual interest through unique shapes and textures. Furthermore, since there aren't too many items cluttering up a room, each piece becomes much more important – giving homeowners the opportunity to display antiques or other meaningful family heirlooms in an interesting way that still fits with the overall vibe of the space. However, despite its numerous benefits there are also some drawbacks associated with minimalist design due to its limited color palette and lack of “stuff” - people may find it difficult to make sure their house feels warm and inviting if they don't have enough decorative elements present! It's also important not to overdo things either – too little clutter can become almost sterile looking if you're not careful about balancing out your accessories accordingly. In conclusion, though minimalist interior design does require careful consideration when decorating any room in your home - once done correctly it can be both stylish and practical solution for anyone wanting something simple yet sophisticated!

From a small cup to an extra-large mug with all the works, coffee knows no bounds in terms of creativity and flavor. In recent years, specialty coffee shops have become all the rage as people search for their perfect cup. For this reason, cold brew has become increasingly popular amongst dedicated java drinkers. Cold brew is made by steeping freshly ground coffee beans in cold water for 12-24 hours before straining out the grounds. The result? A silky smooth cup of non-acidic goodness that’s incredibly rich in flavor! Compared to regular brewed coffee which can turn bitter over time due to oxidation, cold brew tastes delicious even when it sits out for a while – making it ideal for busy mornings or lazy afternoons spent lounging at home or relaxing outdoors on a patio (or balcony!). Cold brew also contains more caffeine than other types of brewed coffees so you’ll definitely be able to stay alert throughout your day – whether you plan on studying or tackling some intense tasks at work!. One great thing about cold brew is how versatile it can be - add milk and honey if you want something sweet; use espresso beans instead of regular roasted ones if you need some serious stimulation; mix up fruity flavors like strawberry basil or blueberry ginger if you're feeling adventurous; get creative with toppings such as orange slices or chocolate curls - possibilities are endless! And who doesn't love combining two awesome things into one amazing drink? Think ""iced mochas"" (coldbrew + cocoa) - so delicious and convenient when all ingredients are prepped ahead of time!. No matter why someone enjoys drinking coffee, there's no denying that coldbrew adds an extra level of sophistication: from its unique brewing process to its smooth taste and energizing kick - every sip will bring joy regardless what kind

"History has long been regarded as a valuable tool for teaching about the past. The study of history provides us with a greater understanding of why certain events occurred in the past, as well as how they may have shaped our present-day lives. In addition, the study of history can provide us with valuable insights into human nature, allowing us to understand why people behave and think the way that they do. Furthermore, the study of history can help us to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past, and can also be used to better understand our own culture, society, and values. 

However, one of the main benefits of the study of history is that it can help to dispel the illusion that people living now are significantly different from people who lived in earlier times. This is because by studying history, we can observe how many of the same issues, events, and people have appeared throughout history. For example, many of the key figures in the French Revolution were idealists who were fighting for freedom — a sentiment shared by people in more modern times, such as those involved in the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Similarly, we can look at the history of conflict between nations to see how different countries have fought against each other for centuries, and observe how some of these differences still affect us today.

In addition, the study of history can also help to dispel the illusion that people living now are significantly different from people who lived in earlier times by demonstrating how many of the same social and cultural norms have been in existence for centuries. For instance, the principles of freedom, democracy, and justice have been central to many societies throughout history, and continue to be important elements of our own lives today. Similarly, the values of loyalty, respect, and self-sacrifice have been part of human culture for generations, and remain essential components of our own beliefs and behaviour. 

Finally, the study of history can be used to help us make sense of our own lives, as well as those of our ancestors. By examining how our ancestors lived and the decisions that they made, we can better understand why things are the way they are today, and can gain valuable insight into how we should approach our own lives. Furthermore, by looking at the successes and failures of the past, we can learn valuable lessons which can inform our own decisions, and can better prepare us for any challenges that we may face in the future.

In conclusion, the study of history can be a valuable tool for teaching about the past, and can also be used to dispel the illusion that people living now are significantly different from people who lived in earlier times. By examining the events, people, and values of the past, we can gain a greater understanding of why things are the way they are today, and can also learn important lessons which can help to inform our own decisions and actions.

"In today's world, there is no doubt that technology is increasingly becoming a more integral part of our everyday lives. From phones to computers and tablets to virtual reality systems, it seems as if the possibilities for technological advances are endless. As such, many people have begun to ponder the effects that this expansive access to modern technology can have on our society and culture. One particular area in which it has been greatly discussed is its influence over education – specifically how students learn information within the classroom setting. As programs become ever more embedded into lessons, students are given an unprecedented level of autonomy when engaging with course materials and developing their understanding of specific topics; all from the comfort of their own homes or even during class itself through interactive activities or online platforms like Google Classroom. This creates both opportunities for deeper engagement with subject matter but also potential challenges associated with self-discipline, focus and organization when working independently outside of instructor guidance. To better understand these implications, we need look no further than recent studies conducted by leading educational organizations exploring how technologies shape student learning habits and outcomes in classrooms across grade levels around the globe. Results indicate that while tech may boost performance in certain areas such as problem solving (as seen in math scores), other subjects like reading comprehension may suffer due to distraction caused by digital devices invading traditional teaching methods (such as lectures). With this knowledge at hand, educators must be sure they prioritize proper integration techniques when utilizing new technologies while ensuring any drawbacks do not outweigh potential benefits derived from usage overall; a task made possible only through effective communication between teachers and administrators alike about best practices for implementation moving forward. No matter what form it takes though — whether it’s lecture slideshows powered by Microsoft PowerPoint or gaming software designed for language arts instruction — one thing remains clear: embracing technology within school settings can prove challenging yet rewarding depending on its usage case-by-case basis offering unique advantages along with some drawbacks too.

"English is an incredibly important language for Chinese learners, and it can be difficult to decide which skill to prioritize. Some people believe that reading should be given greater focus, while others feel that speaking should be prioritized. In my opinion, speaking should take precedence, as it is the most effective way to learn the language.

First and foremost, the ability to speak English is essential for communication. In a world that is becoming increasingly interconnected, speaking English can open up many new opportunities. For instance, many Chinese students go abroad to study and they need to be able to communicate with their peers in English. Furthermore, English is the international language used in business, and Chinese students may need to be able to speak it when negotiating deals or attending meetings. Thus, it is clear that the ability to speak English fluently is vitally important.

Second, speaking is the best way to learn the language. Reading is a great way to learn new words and gain knowledge of grammar and sentence structure. However, speaking is the best way to use words and grammar in context. Through speaking, learners can become more comfortable with the language and learn how to use it in everyday situations. It is much easier to remember words and phrases when they are used in conversation. Furthermore, speaking can help learners become more confident in their ability to communicate in English.

Finally, speaking English can be very enjoyable. Learners can use the language to make friends from different countries and learn about different cultures. It can also be enjoyable to watch movies and listen to music in English. Speaking English can be a great way for learners to have fun and gain a better understanding of the language.

In conclusion, I believe that speaking should take precedence over reading when it comes to learning English. Not only is it essential for communicating with people around the world, but it is also the best way to learn the language and have fun while doing so.

It is widely accepted that having a positive attitude helps individuals to achieve success. It enables us overcome any obstacles that may stand in our path and push us to our full potential; however, success is not exclusively dependent on having a positive attitude. Even with a positive outlook, success is not always guaranteed. It is important to allow ourselves to feel negative emotions and understand that the fullest potential of success cannot be reached without recognizing our insecurities, doubts, and fears. 

One beneficial strategy to maintain positivity when surrounded by negativity is to take a break and focus on something else that brings us pleasure. Finding simple activities that can be enjoyed in our own time can help to temporarily take our minds away from our worries and stressors. Furthermore, having a positive attitude can help us discover our passions and achieve our personal objectives, as we recognize the opportunities and meaningful objectives that each day has to offer. Finally, being surrounded with positive influences and supportive friends and family can help to reinforce our positive outlook and provide us with the optimism and belief of achieving success.",1

Subject: In Favor of Keeping the Electoral College

Dear [Senator's Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College in our presidential elections. The Electoral College, as a compromise between election by Congress and popular vote, has served our nation well and should be upheld for several reasons.

First, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome, reducing the likelihood of a dispute over the election results. As stated by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College always exceeds their popular vote share. With the winner-take-all system in most states, even a slight plurality in a state results in a significant electoral vote victory. Thus, while a tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible, it is highly unlikely.

Second, the Electoral College promotes a sense of unity by requiring presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. As Posner argues, no region in the country has enough electoral votes to elect a president. Consequently, candidates with only regional appeal are unlikely to be successful. This system ensures that the president represents and is accountable to the interests of various regions rather than just a specific region.

Third, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states, ensuring that voters in those states have a significant say in the election. Swing states receive more attention from candidates, leading to more informed and engaged voters. This is crucial in our democracy, as the most thoughtful voters, who pay attention to the competing candidates, should be the ones to decide the election.

Fourth, the Electoral College balances the political power of large and small states. The allocation of electoral votes provides greater weight to large states in proportion to their population, as smaller states typically have a minimum of three electoral votes. This addresses the mal-apportionment of the Senate, ensuring that the interests of both large and small states are taken into account.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections, simplifying the presidential election process. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, as seen in the examples of Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992, the Electoral College still produces a clear winner. This avoids the complications and pressures associated with run-off elections.

While some argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states dominated by one party, it is important to note that voters in presidential elections express their political preference rather than thinking that a single vote may decide the election. Despite this knowledge, approximately half of the eligible American population still chose to vote in the 2012 election.

In conclusion, the Electoral College has proven to be a valuable compromise that ensures certainty of outcome, promotes unity, empowers swing states, balances the political power of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. It is essential for preserving the integrity and effectiveness of our democratic system. I urge you to consider these points when deciding on any potential changes to our election process.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I appreciate your dedication to serving our state and our country. I look forward to seeing your continued support for our democratic principles.

Sincerely,

"Dear Senator, 

I am writing to you today to express my view that the United States should change from the Electoral College system to electing the president by popular vote. While the Electoral College was devised with the intention of giving smaller states more influence in presidential elections, I believe the popular vote system would be fairer and more democratic.

One argument made in favor of keeping the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and campaign in more states. However, research shows that candidates under the current system focus their attention only on swing states that could vote either way. With a popular vote, candidates would have to appeal to a broad range of voters across the entire nation, not just a handful of swing states. This would make the process more democratic. 

It is also argued that without the Electoral College, candidates might just focus on dense population centers. However, in reality every vote would count equally under a popular vote. A candidate would gain votes from rural areas just as in cities, since the goal is to receive the most total votes nationwide rather than in certain states. Some also say a popular vote could reduce the influence of smaller states. But in fact candidates would still try to appeal to voters across all states, large and small, to receive a majority of votes total.

A further issue with the Electoral College is that it can result in a president being elected despite losing the nationwide popular vote. This has occurred a few times in history and creates a perception that the candidate with fewer total votes can still win. A popular vote would avoid this undemocratic outcome and ensure that every citizen's vote carries the same weight. It would make clear that the president is chosen by the will of the American public overall.

For these reasons, I believe the United States should transition to a popular vote system for electing the president. It would make the process more representative and give all Americans an equal say, regardless of what state they live in. I hope you will consider supporting a change to better uphold democratic principles. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

"As China continues to grow as a global power, the importance of English proficiency for Chinese citizens has become increasingly recognized. However, there is a debate over which skill of English is more important for Chinese learners: reading or speaking. In my opinion, while reading is undoubtedly an essential skill, speaking is ultimately more critical for Chinese learners.

Firstly, the ability to speak English is essential for effective communication. Many Chinese learners are able to read and write English at a high level, but struggle to speak fluently. This can cause problems in both personal and professional settings, as clear communication is crucial for success. For example, a Chinese businessperson negotiating with an English-speaking partner would need to be able to communicate effectively in order to reach an agreement. Furthermore, speaking English can help Chinese speakers to form connections with people from other cultures, which can be incredibly valuable in today's globalized world.

Secondly, speaking develops other important skills such as confidence, critical thinking, and creativity. When speaking in English, Chinese learners must think on their feet, responding to questions or comments in real-time. This requires critical thinking skills to assess the situation and come up with an appropriate response. Additionally, speaking develops creativity as learners must find ways to express their ideas and emotions in a different language, often using idiomatic expressions and metaphors. This can be a fun and rewarding process, helping learners to develop their own unique voice in English.

Of course, reading is still an important skill for Chinese learners, as it allows them to access a vast array of knowledge and information in English. However, I believe that speaking should be given priority, as it is the skill that will enable Chinese learners to truly engage with English-speaking cultures and communities. By speaking English fluently, Chinese learners can unlock a world of opportunities and enrich their personal and professional lives.

In conclusion, while both reading and speaking are important skills for Chinese learners of English, speaking should be given priority. Speaking enables effective communication, develops critical thinking and creativity, and facilitates connections with people from other cultures. By prioritizing speaking, Chinese learners can unlock a world of opportunities and enrich their lives both personally and professionally.

"The welfare of children is a primary concern in any society. Governments around the world have a responsibility to provide services and programs that meet the needs of their citizens, both young and old. A key question is whether more of these social programs should be devoted to children than to adults. In my opinion, national governments should prioritize their social programs and services to children over adults.

Children are the most vulnerable members of society, with limited legal rights and no established economic power. In comparison, adults have greater abilities in terms of decision-making and financial independence. This means that they are in a better position to take care of their own needs and interests. For this reason, governments should prioritize services that directly aid children. Such services could include free or affordable healthcare, school lunch programs, and youth recreation centers.

Additionally, investing in children’s social programs and services can have long-term benefits for society. Research indicates that children who have access to quality educational and health services are more likely to become productive citizens and successful adults. This means that investing in children’s services can help create a better, more successful society for the future. Furthermore, this can lead to economic savings in the long run, as fewer resources will be required to deal with the problems that are caused by poverty and neglect.

On the other hand, adults can still benefit from some programs and services. For example, governments can provide access to affordable housing, job training, and mental health services. Such programs can help adults become more self-sufficient and benefit society as a whole. Nevertheless, these types of services should be secondary to those that directly benefit children.

In conclusion, I believe that national governments should prioritize their social programs and services to children over adults. Children are the most vulnerable members of society, and investing in their wellbeing can have long-term benefits for society. Adults can still benefit from some programs, but these should be secondary to those that directly benefit children. By focusing on children’s needs, governments can ensure a brighter future for all.

"When peoples ask for advice, they somtimes talk to more than one person. This is a good thing to do because it can help them make a beter choise. For example, if someones asking for advice on what kind of dog to get, they might talk to a few differnt peoples who have dogs. One person might say that golden retrievers are the best, but another person might say that labradors are better. This helps the person making the desision because they can hear different opions and decide which one is beter for them.

Another reason why seeking multipe opions is good is because it can help you avoiid making a mistakes. If you only ask one person for advice, they might have a bias or not know enought about the subjet. But if you ask a few peoples, you can get a more well-ronded understanding of the situasion and make a more informed desision.

For instance, if someone is thinking about moving to a new city, they might talk to a few different peoples who have lived there before. One person might say that the city is great and has a lot of good jobs, but another person might say that the traffic is terrible and it's hard to get around. This helps the person making the desision because they can weigh the pros and cons and decide if it's the right choice for them.

In conclusion, seeking multipe opions is a good way to make a beter choise. It can help you avoiid making a mistakes and get a more well-ronded understanding of the situasion. So, the next time you need advice, don't be affraid to ask a few differnt peoples what they think.",1
"Making the right choice is easier said than done, but what an unfortunate amount of people don't realize, is that all the help they need to make a better choice, is a simple solution. They just need to talk. Although a simple solution, a sizable amount of people don't even bother to ask others for advice, even when there's enough benefits to fill up an entire essay. Seeking multiple opinions or advice can help someone make a better choice because he or she will acquire advice from different people, learn advice that was earned by experience, and will be able to use advice and opinions from the past.

Conversely, opinions from different people may help an individual make a better choice, for a number of reasons. Firstly, advice from multiple people gives you different perspectives on a matter. Using differing points of view lets you think about a problem in a different way, letting you take a different approach. Varying perspectives may even help you come to a better choice quicker. Not only that, the right choice to a problem almost always requires a diversity in perspectives, but the usefulness of others' advice doesn't stop there. Advice from multiple people also means different opinions. Even if no opinions are satisfactory, advice can be tweaked to one's liking, a combination of some, or compared.

Then, there's the opinions that don't need change. The ones that have been earned from others' experience. These essential opinions help make better choices because they're based on experiences that have actually happened. For obvious reasons, these opinions are reliable, not to mention the person sharing said advice believes that it would help your situation as well. That's not all. Opinions from experience narrows down the choices to make. This can really help making a better choice that much easier. Not only does it show a perfect solution, it helps to make the decision faster, without stressing too much over it.

Finally, a solution that doesn't require asking anyone for help, is remembering advice gained before. This solution also helps to cut down on time to make a better decision, and could amass more advice than if one had asked for opinions from others. This solution doesn't restrict itself to just oneself. Individuals may also look into their friends and family's past. Because friends and family are the closest to a person, one may easily be able to recall events and advice given to close ones.

These are some easy solutions one shouldn't try to miss when faced with a decision. You could learn different points of view, real advice that could be applied to yourself, or learn to remember the past, but in the end, they're all telling the same thing. Something that ""...an unfortunate amount of people don't realize."" Just talk. It's easier than you might think.",0
"During my life i have watched many presidential elections on my television. To me the Electoral College on paper should work, Should being the key word. As I read the paragraphs on both why the Electoral College work and does not work I have decides the side with not having the Electoral College.

Historical evidence and evidence from this paragraph piont to not having a Electoral College. One reason for this was when Al Gore lost the presidency but won the popular vote nation wide as stated in Source 2. another piont is that if the people have so munch power over who is voted to be president then how do we have a president that the people did not want the president but the person is still elected, its an outrage! One example of how the Electoral College could be a disaster waiting to happen is that the votes are tied which may seem not likey at first glance but say if the votes are tied the presidency is thrown into the House of Representatives which lets face it, in the end the decision will not be approved by the people and the people will then barely have a say on who gets to be president or not. Another thing is the Electoral College can also be vary bisest towrdes one party or the other. This is evident because if a certain party got more electors than another party which whould led to a canedat from one party have more support then another.

Source 3 talks about how sure thats its possible for their to be a tie in the Electoral College but its unlikely supports what im trying the say in my earlier Paragraph, that even though a tie is unlikely it is still possible to happen the chance is still their. This paragraph also says the everyone is a president but if that is the case then why dose the poeple that ""we"" vote for the electoral College help vote for the president insted vote for the other canadate is an atrosidy on its own. The winnertakeall system is one that only afects the swing states because if thoughs states have already voted then the staes the already votes whould be for not because the numbers for who gets voted whould be already in favor of one state or another. The fact the larger states have a bigger say in who gets voted on is not fair. the is becuase if all the big states vote for someone and about 14 of the smaller states vote on one end of the scale and the other states vote towrdes the other end of the scale then the ballence whould be off and one side would overpower the other side by fact of shear numbers of votes compared to the other side.

After reading over my responce and the evidence that I have profided form the paragraph hear I have with great pride that i have argued my point across to you that the Electoral College in paper is good but in reality is only a crumbleing castle waiting to fall into the tiny bites and pieces that it should be.",0
"In 1976 pictures where taken of Mars with the Viking 1 spacecraft from NASA. We have dicovered that the pictures look like a face on Mars. We can garentee that ""aliens"" did not do this. From the data we collected it seems to be that Mars was having formations and the ground/rocks looked like it had shadowed a face.

Over the years as you can tell in the pictures the face begins to form into something different. The ""Face"" is starting to not look like a face anymore. If there were life on Mars they would try to keep the form from changing, right?

Yes we know what you are thinking, ""That cant be Mars doing that,"" but we have not collected any data of any sign of life on Mars. We have no reason to believe that Mars has any life form of any kind on it. We have seen from other data though that Mars has been changing and the landforms have changed. This is just another formation.

Futhermore we have concluded that the ""Face"" on Mars is just rock formation. There is no futher information on the ""alien"" therory and that this is out of the picture.. As you can tell in the picture there is other rocks surrounding it and it is just like the other rocks, they have shadows and the ""Face's"" shadow is just more life like. The formations of every planet have changed and will continue to change so anything can happen next.",0
"It is wise that election is chosen by popular vote. I think that it should be kept this way, and all that are Electoral College should be changed to election by popular vote. Election by popular vote is an easier choice and makes things more simple. It could give candidates more of a chance to get elected. Time would be wisely saved if all states had the same system, it would give people more of a chance to get elected.

In the Electoral College voters vote for a portion of electors, not the president. The Electoral College is unfair to voters, this process is just undated and not right. A lot of states may not even see their candidates. If election by popular vote is used more than the places that don't, then they should be changed.

It is just easier to decide when there are more or less voters. The Electoral College just has less of a chance to be kept. If every state did the same to elect then it would be easier to decide who should be the president of the United States.",0
"In my personal oppinion I think it's best to keep the Electoral College. Don't get me wrong I think people should have a say in it too, but in all seriousness we the people we really can't make good decisions. For instance what they say may blind us from the hard on facts and we'll make a horrible decision just because they can manipulate us with words. The Electoral College can pick the person that is perfect for the job but we can't.

""A candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president."" (Richard A. Posner) It states there that if the person is popular in some sates and everybody likes him, that doesn't mean he would be fit to be president. The Electoral College doesn't pick them because of what they say and if they persuide you to like them, they look at the facts and see if that person is fit to be the president. Maybe it's best if they were to decide on the president but I'm also saying that we should have some say in it.

We're the ones living here we all have a right too. It doesn't matter if we make poor decisions we're only human that's what we do, that doesn't mean we shouldn't have a say in it. ""The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" (Bradford Plumer) Sure the Electoral College doesn't normally decide on what we have to say but they should take it in consideration.

I think that we should keep the Electoral College and let the proffessionals do what they do best. As the people living with what the president has to say I still think it's highly important that we have some say on who the president is. Will we make the right decisions? probably not but we're only human can you blame us? No I didn't think so.",0
"Cars come in different colors, and are what we use to transport anything. Whether it a family going on vacation, going to  work or going to school.  With all of these possible benfits and more is what we gain from cars. We don't realize how cars really have an effect in our everyday changing world. That the moment we put the car key in to turn on the car we are creating are more hazordous world for the present time and  the furture to come. By,limiting car usage in the world we can do many postive and beneficial things like in our atmosphere,  becoming a independent person without the need of a car, and to be relive as oneself.

To begin with, pollution can be reduced like never ever before in are world named history. Pollution now in days is just terrible to have. It not just make it difficult  for us to breathe but, as well it destroy the atmoshere that we need protect us from the harmful rays of the sun. The greenhouse effect can be lowered if we limit the use of cars. This can be actually proven with the following exert of the passage,"" And that experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" (Source #1) The point that I'm really trying to convey, is that we can do this all together if we limit the car usage. There should be a well and profounded effort to do so. Another example would be that if we dont limit the usage of cars we can not have a fresh and clear atmoshere. Can you imagine a day that you wake up to find, that all that was around you be nothing but a smog and prevent you to see and do anything? The car we have produce dangerous toxic that can up in are air and can be very hard for us later on. But if limit car usage, we can prevent this from happening. Not, just us but to other place in the world. This was what happen in France ,to prevent the usage for cars producin that smog they created an renforce day to prevent the use of car. Which lead to a shocking over turn of news. Like so in the following,""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France"" (Source #2) What I'm trying to inform once again is that we limit we can create a better fit living world to be in. This is one advantages that we can do as fellow citizens in our country

Which lead to me to my othe point, there is more that we have in advantage of limiting the usage of cars. It is a way of ""smart planing"" ourself as a community. We can live a more free caring world without the need of a car. Technology can play a part in the limit of of car usage. As stated in the folllowing ""The Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends."" (Source #4)See this occur and happen this a will fitted advantage to us all. Another, advantage that we have in hand is the ability to relieve our stress level to a much stable level. which lead to me to my other insight of information, ""When I had a car I was alwaystense. I'm much happier this way"" said Heidrun Walter"" (Source #1) Being in the car makes it complicated and diifficult. This is another way for us take advantage to limit the use of cars.

In conclusion, there are many advantegous for that we can benifit from that if we limit the use of care by lower pollution in are atmospher, creating a more benficial way for ouself without the need of a car, the relive of oneself. So, the next time you get on your car think is it reall a need to do so?",0
"Are you for or against the value of using this technology to read students emotional expression? No, I do not believe we as a whole should be able to use this. The reason why I believe this should not happen is because everyone is intitled to their own opinion. The fact that a computer is able to distinguish this type of information is very scary.

In the article the author Nick D' Alto talks about Mona Lisa he says ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"" (Alto 1). This quote itslef is nerve racking due to the fact that a computer is able to find this information out. Using this type of technology to read students emotional expressions would be helpful but it would not be professional. Honestly who would want to see what a teenager feeling?

There are many other ways this technology can be used such as prison. so we are able to track prisoners feelings. Overall using this type of technology on a group of inncocent people is unprofessional. This type of technology should be controlled in a proper manner.",0

"Will vehicles be gone in the near future? Many movements have started due to cars polluting the air and melting the polar ice caps. For one, a community has been built where cars are not allowed, and a car-free movement started in Bogata, Columbia three years ago that banned vehicles other than buses and taxes. Also, due to deisel cars polluting the air that made Paris be on par with China's pollution, they ended up banning cars for some time.

""Since World War II, all of our development has been centered on the car,"" said David Goldberg, an official of transportation for America. The Environmental Protection Agency of the United States is promoting ""car reduced"" communities. Many hope that public transport serving suburbs play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year. 80 percent of appropriations have by law only gone to highways and 20 percent to other transport. Vauban, which was completed in 2006, is one example that seperates suburban life from auto use. As a result of 40,000 dollars being needed to buy a space for a car along with a home, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars. Vauban, with a population of over 5,000 residents, might be the most advanced low-car suburban life experiment.

Bogota, Columbia has started with a car-free day which is spinning into a big hit. Millions of Columbians either hiked, biked, skated or took buses to get to their destinations during the car-free day. For three straight years, in the capital city of Bogata, 7 million people were able to get to their destinations without the use of cars. As said by one of the residents of Bogota, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and air pollution"". 118 miles of bicycle paths have been made due to the improvement campaign that was created in the mid-1990s. Many parks and sportss centers have also bloomed throughout the city due to the campaign and ban on vehicles.

Due to all the congestion and pollution, Paris ended up issuing a partial driving ban to clear the air of pollution. In the following days, motorists with either even or odd numbered plates were either forced to leave their cars at home or pay a fine of 31 dollars. Due to the fact that France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline, they were blamed for the pollution in the air. 67 percent of vehicles in france are diesel vehicles. After 5 days congestion was down about 60 percent which rivaled the pollution was in Beijing, China which is know as one of the most hugely polluted cities in the world. Due to Paris putting a temporary ban on cars, they had complains about companies losing revenue. When the pollution in the air started to clear up enough, the ban on cars was lifted.

In conclusion, cars might end up being banned in multiple places around the globe to help with pollution. According to experts, it is said that there has recently been a large drop in the usage of cars and it will continue to drop. Demographic shifts suggests that there has been a large decline in the percentage of 16 to 39 year olds getting licenses to drive vehicles. A study last year has also showed that driving by young people has declined 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. Many studys have showed that the decline in people getting licenses and driving will continue to reduce rapidly.",0
"Many people agree in abolishing the Electoral College. Electoral Collage caused a dispute in the year 2000. The Electoral College is a irrational system and it should be banned.

Certainly the Electoral College has some benefits. In the passage ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our sidpised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner the author states that the Electoral College ""avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of votes cast."" With the Electoral College there is no issue of a candidate getting the most votes, so there wont have to be any runoff elections. Runoff elections complicated the election process. Posner asserts that the ""winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote."" It is because of this that the possibility of an argument over the outcome of an Electoral College is lesser then an argument over the popular vote. Although this is true, the people should have the say on who their president will be. The Electoral College is a broken voting system that causes confusion and dispute. Therefore, the Electoral College should not be used as a way of voting for America's President.

A key issue is that the candidate with the most popular vote does not have the certainty of winning. This is a problem because America can not have the leader she wants and deserves. Bradford Plumer from the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" argues that the Electoral College causes "" the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency."" If the people can not chose who they want as their leader then where is their freedom? Plumer also states that the voters can not always ""control whom their electors vote for,"" We dont get to chose who the electors are voting for. This way the value of the people's opinion is being diminished into nothing. The reasonable solution to this problem is to just end the Electoral College imidiatly.

Another factor is that the electors have to much power over the election. Palmer writes ""that the electors could always defy the will of the people,"" The electors are the only people who have decent amount of power to chose a president. The people should have that kind of power. The author asserts that the electors "" have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please,"" The electors are able to just change their mind when wver they like. The popular vote must decide on who should win. The future of america should depend only on the will of the people. The people has to finally stand up and fight for their right to chose their own President.

In final consideration, the Electoral College is unfair to the American people. We should have freedom to chose whom our country's leader should be. The popular vote should stay and the Electoral College should be banned once and for all.",0
"Venus has been a planet neighboring the Earth and the Sun for many years. There has been many discoveries about the planet Venus and about other planets too. More discoveries can be made in order to figure out how we can live on other planets and also other discoveries for Venus can be made.

Venus is called the Evening Star due to the fact that it is very bright when seen. Venus is the second planet in our solar system and it is almost as bright like the sun, when a stargazer looks up to the sky they can see our planet venus because it is easy to spot for a couple reasons. One beinging it is bright and the second it is close to our moon. The Moon and Venus can be considered twins, they are close in size, and it is close to our Earth but it is also close to the Moon. Venus is a warm planet not nearly as hot as the Sun but somewhere around there, so if huamns were sent up to space to live on Venus they wouldn't survive. There is no water in Venus it is just hot and lots of lava.

Over the years NASA has tried to send spacecraft up to Venus. They haven't been succesful due to the fact that it's so hot on Venus, every spacecraft ever sent has only lasted a couple hours. Not a single human has even been on Venus, they wouldn't want to risk someones life if a spacecraft cant survive than a human wouldn't be able to survive. Venus is truly a difficult planet for humans to study, not a single space ship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Planet venus has 97 percent carbon dioxide, the temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit that is extremely hot, that is 90 times greater than what we experince on Earth. We would think that Mercury would be a hotter planet due to the fact that it is closer to the Sun but it turns out it's not.

Even though Venus is a hard planet to study scientist haven't given up yet. They are willing to do everything that is possible in order to find out more about it, scientist still want to visit the planet. Scientists say that Venus at one point was the most Earth-like planet in our solar system, it probably had Oceans on it, Valleys and even mountains. Scientists are still developing new technology to send humans up into Venus so they can study it and find out more about the planet. They have even thought about designing something that allows astronauts to float on Venus so they dont have to be on Venus, that way they wont get burned.

In Conclusion, more discoveries can be made in order to figure out how we can live on other planets and many more discoveries for Venus can be made. Many things are still being tested in order for us to find out more about our planet. Scientist aren't going to give up until they get some clear shots, there may be some difficulties during the process but it will totally be worth it. Nasa is working on other approaches to study Venus, some simplified eletronics have been made to make it easier to study Venus. These eletronics will be easy to use so scientist can make further discoveries but also study the planet without getting hurt.",0
"Today I will be talking about being on your phone while driving and why you shouldn't do it. We will be speaking about what can happen if you be on your phone while driving and what the punishment may be. And we will speak about the reason we shouldn't do it and what may happen if we do.

You shouldn't be on your phone in the car because you can get distracted from the road and in up doing something or crashing. Also if you have someone else in the car with you, you will end up putting their life at risk there life shouldn't be in the hands of someone who focus on their phone more than driving. Texting & driving is more debilitating to your reaction time than driving while under the influence of alcohol. That shows that what you are doing on your phone you will be more on that then driving and have more of a chance of crashing or getting in a wreck.

Now we will be talking about the punishment for being on your phone while driving. Monetary fines these can range from as low as $20 up to $500 depending on the state. Is it really worth almost $500 just so you can send that message. Next is in some states texting while driving can result in criminal misdemeanor charges. Finally, if the offense has resulted in bodily injury to another driver, jail or prison time may be imposed. You can end up going to jail and or prison just for being on your phone these thing are given to you because of the dangers of being on your phone while driving. People who chose to be on their phone while driving are choosing to put other people in danger because you want to see who texted you.

For, Conclusion being on your phone while driving is very bad it can end up to you getting in an accident even end up hurting other people on the road. The outcome of you being on your phone while driving you can have to pay a fine for over $500 and next even jail time. There is no good reason for you to be on your phone while driving whenever you really need to check your phone pull over and do so but doing on while driving is never a good thing. To end this all off being on your pone while driving never do just don't it just ends in pain and regret.",0
"Have you ever needed advice for a choice before? If you have and you have trouble making them on your own, that can affect your actions. If you don't know what to do go get some opinions from others. Getting multiple perspectives from others helps you because you will get more opinions on what to do and what not to do.

First, knowing that you have more then one person to talk to and get their opinion, can make you more likely to go ask more people for them. If people have had similar problems to you, where other people have those problems. Get both opinions on this problem, the more opinions you get the more options you have on your choice. It can also turn into you helping someone if you go to them and you guys work together to fix this problem on both ends.

Next, talking to multiple people could lead to different emotions on this topic and help you understand how you could feel. You could have a strong feeling about your opinion but you always need to think about what you're going to say. The more you talk about this to others, the more you will hear yourself and your perspective might change. If your perspective changes this could cause you to do something different that can lead to you having a better choice and decision.

Lastly, if you get only one opinion that could have a negative impact on you, leading to you making the wrong choice which can't be undone. In past experience I have had to make some choices, many of them i'm not to proud with. Most of the time I went to get one persons opinion because I didn't have much faith or trust in others. That ended up badly because they gave me their opinion and I didnt have any other opinions to base her's off of, so the choice I made ended up being a mistake.

In conclusion, having many peoples opinions to make a better choice and not mess up is better than just getting one opinion. You need to think hard about whose/what opinion you're gonna take. As stated in the essay, one opinion could have a bad influence, your emotions about it can vary and having people to talk to will make you go talk to more people. How will having multiple opinions help you with your choices?",0
"In this world many people or students were being suicide and some people they just don't have hope. Many people are facing many different kind of difficulties and sadness. For instance some people might be upset because they don't have families and can be because they are not as smart as other people in school. Some people are facing difficulties while other are living happily. But we people don't know how other people feel and we don't understand each other how we feel inside of our heart.

First,using this technology to read students' emotional expressions is valuable. The reason why i think it is good is because sometimes some students are not as smart as other students and some students are afraid to ask question that they don't understand and afraid to discuss with their teacher. But if we use this technology to read students' emotional expression in class, it would be really useful thing and meaningful for students. it would make students even better and smarter. As we can see in the articles it says""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" If all teachers use the computer that knows students' feelings that would also help/make student to improve and develope their knowledge. Second,some students keep skipping class it can be because since they don't understand the lessons that they learn, they feel bored and stress and they behave bad in class so it makes them want to skip class so that they can stay away from stressness. But if teachers use technology that can read studens' emotional expression so that teacher would know which student doesn't understand and confused the lessons and teacher can explain those who didn't understand after school or during their lessons. Finally if they keep using this technology,one teacher can change a thousand studens' bad behavor and mind.

In conclusion,making useful things for those who feel hopeless and helpless are one of precious thing in our lives. Even though we all are came from different countries we have similarities things in some ways like how we face difficulties and that thing makes us one.",0
"All we talk about is being able to be our own person and to be able to do things on our own but having electoral college isn't gonna help with that. Electoral college is when you select a group of electors to chose who they want to be president and you choose the group of electors which you want. Every group of electors will have their own opinion on who they want to be president so you have to be very cautious on who you pick. Popular vote is a more independent way of letting us citizens know that we can be able to vote without the help of our electors. Senator, it would be outrageous for us to be so dependent on the electors when its unnecessary and we can vote on our own.

There have been times when people choose the wrong electors and they can't go back to change it, so why not just vote on your own and have the ability for clarrification and honesty on who I vote for. I feel like having an electoral college is a waste of time and it's only making things more complicated. If you should have a system it should be one that makes peoples lives easier not even more stessful. Also the voters can't control who the electors vote for so you make be telling the electors one thing but they will be doing another. These are the things that us citizens need to thing about. Should we have to doubt our electors? no, we should trust that they will vote for the president that we asked them too.

Voting for president is very serious because, that president will be representing where we live and what we stand for so it can't be something that we slack off on, it needs to be something that we are proud of and the only way thats going to happen is if we choose our own president without our electors to do that for us. Us citizens should be proud and honored that we have the opportunity to choose our president because not most people have that chance and electoral college will be taking that for granted. Popular vote assures that our vote counts and it gives us the independent character that we need to be strong.

Senator, I think that if you want everyone to fell secure and trusted then you should keep using popular vote.",0
"The ""Face"" on mars(the red planet) been there since 1976 which is when it was discovered and was not fully formated yet and still is not formed. So,it shows that it was not created millions of year's ago by some extra-terrestrial bieng(s).Also,when the Viking 1 Mars Global Surveyor(MGS) took the photo in 1976 it looked as if it was just a common landform created by some-type of desert storm,and now that other photos have came in from May 24,2001 from Viking 2 we are shown that it is not a face but a few mesa's(mesa-landforms common around the American west) with shadows on it showing features of a human bieng but are really just hills of sand with weirdly shaped landforms and shadows. Also,on many planets we have seen craters,mountain,and canyons that look like something they're not,and when the shadows are not there you can tell that they are just naturally formed sand hills. Finally,In 1998 the Mars Orbiter Camera(MOC) took 10 photos much sharper photos(5 times sharper)than the original Viking 1 did in 1976 and the photos on the (MOC) showed and revealed to be that there was no alien monument or alien worshipping monument just natural landforms.",0
"Would you like if your emotions are being detected withouht your consetiment? Technology is every day beging more capable of new things, in terms of artificial intelligenece. The new software has been developled so that it can read or decode the emotions of others. Dr. Eckman has classified six bassic emotions - happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness-, he assocciated each emotion with movements on the facial muscles.

It is important to know how the muscles in our body , in our face works , and what an amazing way to know through technology. But at the point to that technology knows what are your emotions to then use them on ""what you need"" is not correct. I am not saying that when we want to search about emotions through technology there should not be anything on it. But what if we are trying to hide emotions for our or others good and technology just cames and reads or decodes your emotions how would you feel?

It is also important to know the basic of emotions, because that how you express yourself.",0
"In my ophion, technology reading students emotional expressions is the dumbest thing ever and here is why.

First, the apps they are using just changes the student indivaully like you can not make someone be happy on a computer you can make them look happy they should not change someone for who they want them to be vs what they are. Second, you should not change a photo or use any edits because thats changing you and you should just be you if you dont smile thats okay dont let people judge you on how you look you should impress your self not somebody eles. Third, People today need to realize that changing someone in any type of way could hurt them even worse. Yes, messing with peoples emotion or sometimes trying to figure it out whats wrong with them can set off alot of things. Instead of making someone look happy people should talk to the person that is upset, trying to be there for them maybe thats all they need or tell them soemthing postive to brighten there day.

In Conclusion, I think changing someones pictures to make them look like they are happy is the wose idea ever because deep down they know they are, but do you just because someone makes and upset face dosnt always mean they are.",0
"I thinks the new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enbles computers to indenify humans emotions is good things like what the author says on paragraph 3 because that can helps the people if the computers can indentify people emotions like if they happy or sad and if it can makes people feels better if the computers help the people like taking them to a websites where they can read a story or others like playing games, listen to music and watching news that make them relaxing.

Also I thinks what the sciencetists says on paragraph 1 ""Developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate"", this means that they said like it better for all people if they developing a software that can recognize emotions.

Another good things about the emotion recongnition like what it says on paragraph 4 because the software can also recognize faces on a pictures.

If the new computer software that can tells people emotions, sciencetists should make them more valuable like adding more news features to it and that will make more people to like them.",0
"Dear Senator, Electoral college may be a despised method to some people but it has been the system established by our founding fathers and remains until this day. It may not be perfect but every method has its flaws, including popular vote, respectively. The popular voting system is not the best method since it can end up not defining certainty of the outcome. Electoral college has prevailed until this day and it should remain this way for the United States of America.

Although electoral college may be called outdated, irrational and unfair Brandon Plumer 14. This isnt true because if it were so outdated and unfair it would have been substituted or changed by another system but it has remained because of its efficiency. This system is certainly not unfair because as stated in a article by Richard A. Posner,he explains ""each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed."" As for the irrational portion of the opposing view, as stated in "" in defense of the electoral college..."" article has multiple reasons but one of them is ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal."" No region South,Northeast,etc. has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" The single best argument against Electoral College may be called ""the disaster factor"" as claimed by Brandom Plumer in his article opposing the Electoral College. Certainty of Outcome is a strong point for Richard a. Posner in his article defending the electoral college and carefully states ""A dispute over the outcome of the Electoral College vote is possibleit happened in 2000but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote."" He Richard Posner also reminds the reader that the Electoral College avoids issues in elections in which no candidate receives majority of the votes cast and there is no pressure for a ""runoff election"" when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast.

Another factor brought to our attention by ""the indefensible electoral college..."" article is that since the Electoral College uses the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates dont lose time in states they are most likely to not win in and they focus mostly on ""swing"" states. Although the ""swing"" states system is used, it is simply utilized becauseit induces the candidates as seen in 2012's election. But the voters in tossup states are most likely to pay more attention to the campaign, and it is decreed that the most thoughtful voters should be the chosen ones to decide the election.

Ultimately with all the information cited it is quite obvious which option is best for the U.S. Electoral College may have it's cons but the pros outweigh it. This is not a new method. It was defined by the Founding Fathers that wrote our constitution that has held our country in unisom until this day. Now in 2015 it is still the leading force in the government and should be kept that way. the Electoral college is the best suited for America and should'nt be altered.",0
"Hey you! Do you need some advice about something and you just don't know what will give you the best answer? Well you are in luck because this may help you! Talking to more than one person for advice is the best solution. Seeking multiple answers can help someone make a better choice because it can prevent bias, you will have more answers, and you will feel great at the end. Listening to more than one opinion is more reliable than just listening to one. Whenever I ask for some advice I always talk to more than one person because at the end I will feel good about myself. Everyone have their own opinion about something. If you ask more than one person then you will realize their answers will be different.

Seeking multiple opinions can prevent bias. If you ever watched the news then you know some news sites contains a lot of bias. That is why you hear some people say to read more than one article. Just like reading more than one article, it is more reliable to listen to multiple opinions instead of one. Everyday I look at the media and I see plenty amounts of events happening. Whenever I click on one I will have to look at other articles because I keep thinking there is bias in them. Which is why in the world there are a lot of disagreements which leads to bias in the news, media and even in people that you trust. It is right for someone to have their own opinion, but it is also right for someone to be cautious about their opinion. By hearing more than one opinion, you will get the best advice from multiple people.

You will be provided with more than one answer. Everyone have their own opinion about something. For example, if you asked someone for advice about what to do before a test then one may say ""Just eat a mint"" or ""Eat a healthy breakfast"". With the example here I have a lot of options to choose from. If you ever asked your classmate a question and they answered it, but they said they don't know if it's correct then you should have asked your teacher or other classmates. This will not only allow you to get your correct answer but it also allows you to get more than one answer. Having more than one answer is always a good thing because you can look at them and find the differences and similarities. You can also use the extra advice too.

You will feel comfortable after talking to more than one person. Looking back at the last paragraph, I said you will be provided with a lot of answers if you talk to more than one person. It will also make you feel comfortable too! One time I needed some advice for middle school so I asked my parents, teachers, and my older brother. They all responded differently, but I also got a lot of advice too. I felt comfortable because I have a good amount of advice. You will feel better after talking to more than one person because you are sure that the answer they gave you is correct and reliable.

Seeking multiple answers can help someone make a better choice because it can prevent bias, you will have more answers, and you will feel great at the end. After reading this you may still think ""Why is this important?"". It is important because someday everyone will need to use this technique to make sure they are getting the best advice possible. The next time you need advice or your friend need advice then please use this technique to help you and your friend to get the reliable answers.",0
"Would you like to explore another planet? If so, which one? The author of this artical talks about exploring Venus. He explains what its like there and gives us facts like how it can be the closest planet to Earth time to time but it's really hot there and hard to explore. His reasons for exploring Venus is the closest planet to earth and is earth like and its a challenge that we should take no matter the risk. I dont think that he explained good enough on why its worth it.

The author of the artical, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" tells us that ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."" This means that because its close and Earths ""twin"" its its worh exploring no matter the challenge it brings.

The author also says ""Our travels on Earth should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" When he says this he thinks that we should explore Venus no matter the dangers but in the artical he listed the dangers. He says Venus has a ""thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater that what we experience on our own planet."" If it's 90 times grater than what we experience on earth is it worth studying? He tells us that they sent nemerous spaccrafts to Venus but nun of them survieved longer than a few ours. If your spaceships cant land there and survive why send a human there risking lives?

In conclusion he told us some good facts about Venus like how its called Eaths twin, can be closest to earth sometimes, almost same size and same density,and that its 800 degrees Fahrenheit but i dont think his reasons explained good enough on why we should risk exploring there but he did have some good ideals on what they can do to explore Venus like hover over it 30 plus miles studying it.",0
"The Electoral College basically serves as a filter for the votes of every individual American citizen. Every single vote that comes from citizens is a vote for somebody else who will be voting for the president, not the candidates themselves. The Electoral College is flawed to the point where the most logical way to vote would be to base presidential elections off of popular votes.

The Electoral College encourages the presidents who are running for office to avoid campaigning towards states with a smaller amount of electoral voters. If the president is determined by the most electoral votes, it would make sense that the president would campaign towards larger states with more electoral voters such as California, Texas, and Florida. Why would they spend time trying to appeal to some of the smaller states? This can lead to some states not even seeing the candidate. Infact, during the 2000 election, voters in the 25 largest media markets did not witness any campaign advertising.

The Electoral College's process of voting suppresses the voice of every citizen. The balance between smaller and larger states comes into play here as well. Take Florida for example, a state with 29 total electoral votes. If the mass majority of Florida votes for a certain set of electors, the minority votes for the other ones would not matter at all, as the electors speaking for that certain fraction of the population would not elected. With popular voting, each and every vote would matter towards electing a president. The number of minority votes would directly apply to the outcome of the president.

The Electoral College and the electors should not be the voice of the country. The voice of the people should be heard, especially when it comes to presidential elections. Popular voting is the most fair and rational method of voting. The Electoral College is best off forgotten as a voting system.",0
"The Face on Mars is a natural landform it has been a pop icon since it started in HollyWood Films, Books, Magazines, Talk shows, and haunted check-out lines for more than 20 years!. How could The Face on Mars be created by aliens if aliens aren't real? Why would NASA go through all that trouble to make a fake Face on Mars.

The face is a natural landform because, before it was a face NASA captioned it as a ""Huge rock formation"". It was a humans head it was also formed by shadows, which made it seem like the huge rock formation had eyes, nose, and a mouth. But it was just an illusion. NASA knew that if they were to put the ""huge rock formation"" on Mars they would attract a lot of attention. The were right! As soon as the huge rock formation was on Mars that's when NASA started getting all the attention NASA knew was coming.

So this is why I state that NASA's ""huge rock formation"" is NOT fake, like I said earlier why would NASA go through so much trouble just to make a fake humans head on Mars?",0
"So do you think this technolgy to read emotional expressions is right? To start with like maybe reading animals probaly not reading us humans like we really dont need a meachine to read us we can read ourselfs. You can just see how your feeling that day and if your feeling good thtas good. I absoulty dis agree with this artical. How much money would we have to pay for these things anyway like there gonna be pretty expansive.

Also in the text us humans can read our firends once we get to know them we will know if there having a bad day. Eckman has classfied six basic emotions happiness,surprise,anger,disgust,fear,sadness. Just stateing this im pretty shure i would know if i was all of them emotions maybe a meachine to read my future i would want to see. Also back to my point why buy this when there are much nearer things to buy. Maybe people that are depressed is gonna say thats not true im happy and all this.",0

Phones and Driving

Modern society and cell phones, its an unbreakable bond, like a child to its mother's hip. There's a big problem with people using smartphones while behind the wheel of an automobile, and its causing wrecks, finder binders, people on the sides of the road to get hit from oncoming traffic, and people walking into the middle of the road while texting. Society has become more and more stuck to their screens. On a daily basis i see people swerve in and out of my lane on the road. Even when riding with my own friends, i constantly tell them to get off their phones, never do they listen.

The people of the world have lost the respect for vehicles that they used to have. We have become accustomed to using technology at all points of our lives. Wrecks happen everyday because someone couldn't wait to see who texted them back. Texting and driving has become a serious issue, with phones getting more and more involved in our lives it is apparent that action needs to be taken. When driving a motor vehicle of any type, a cellphone, tablet, apple watch, or ipod should in no way be able to be used. It puts the public peoples and themselves at risk of death or serious injury.

A law just came out in georgia that is a no hands law, you can not even have your phone in your lap, in your shoulder, definitely not in your hand, and nowhere near your face when driving a vehicle. I believe this should go in effect everywhere, and have some serious reinforcement from the police of society. Without someone to make people think before they act. That song you just couldn't wait to change, or that text that you just had to send, or that snapchat that you had to watch could be the very last thing you do. For the safety of you, and everyone around you please take action.

"What would you do without car usage? Is there such thing as too much or too little car usage? Many residents or travelers are nearby thier destination and don't nessesaraly need a car to get there. Although, for other's they may need to use a car becasue of extended distance. Limiting car usage has many advantages.  For example, in Vauban, Germany streets are completely ""car free"". According to the article "" 70% of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57% sold car's to move here"". Families and friends are much active with each other and can spend more quality time outside of school and work.

When there is less car usage more public transportation will be available to thoose who need it more importantly. Also there would be less polution with the gas and air. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"", said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza. Due to the smog that was in France, car's was banned. ""Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday"", according to the BBC. Fuel is also a great impact. Do you ever feel like you just work hard for nothing? Money is being wasted on gas, car materials, and car details much more then the things it really needs to be spent on.

Limiting car usage could mean less accidents. Less accidents means less deaths and injuries. Driving could be risky especially in crowdy places with people and other cars. Limiting cars could also mean people getting to know diffrent places often and not just the places they are used to going. Parks and sports centers also have had bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramtically cut traffic; and new resturants and upscale shoppung districts have cropped up. Families are more engaged together and work together to make it to thier destination.

In conclusion, Do you feel as if car polution should be limited becasue of all the advatages. Limiting car usage has it advantages and disadvatages. Many things could possibly happen. According to The end of Car Culture article, ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportations traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve recources, lower emissions and improve saftey"". The Mobile World Congress is looking for more saftey ways to transport and get to yout destintation when needed. Due to limiting car-usage families and friends can now spend quality time while getting to thier locations, you can go to your nearby places, you could save more money of gas and car details, and also you could prevent less accidents if possible.",0
"Life has revolved around driving since the termination of World War II. In sources 1 and 4, the authors mention the population's inhabitants have greatly reduced or stopped car usage wholly voluntarily. While in sources 2 and 3, the cities have banned car usage on certain days. The advantages of limiting car usage include less pollution and increased accessibility to the entire city.

Pollution is an large issue in todays world. According to Rosenthal in source 1, ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States P5."" The use of cars has created smog in many large cities. The 2009 Olympics in Bejing required the city to reduce car usage in order to clear the air. Those participating and attending the event were in danger of harming their lungs. The citizens of Bejing has already been noted to wear respirators and other devices to filter the toxins from the air they breathe. In this extreme case, it was mandatory to cut the usage of cars down. But in other cities, they have not reached this extreme and it can be easily prevented by limiting car usage. Duffer mentions the pollution in the skies of the global city of Paris has been noticeably decreasedP19. In another scenario of pollution in the atmosphere, the city has taken initiative to ban cars depending on the number of their license plate. Without the emissions from the cars, the air would be clean to breath and a better sight as well.

The new generation has grown up with cars yet when the time comes to obtain a license, they forgo the opportunity. Selsky says that without cars, the city's parks and sports centers have been heavily visited. The pedestrian walkways and shopping centers have also came in large numbersP28. Due to the abandonment of cars, upscale commerce and new restaurants were constructed. Rather than a large mall near some interstate or other large roadway, shopping districts have transformed into locations in which are near public transportation or in walking distance. Rosenthal shares an anecdote that outlines that public transportation, carpooling, and even walking have replaced the car for himself and his childrenP40. Public transit is not viewed down upon anymore, it is a smarter way of getting from one place to another. Carpooling isn't a desprete call, it is a resource that has become essential and benificial to both parties. A combination of carpooling, walking, and public transit makes the city much easier to access and explore.

The development of cities is no longer based on cars. It is now be based upon the access it will give to those without cars. Limiting the use of cars makes the city improved in many ways. Clean air and more efficient ways of transportation highlights that cars are no longer needed and limiting car usage will have even more advantages in the future.",0
""" During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markests didn't get to see the candidates at all.""-Bradford Plumer. Are society is relaying on this electoral college system, when we don't even know who are those electors. I agree, that we should change our election to a popular vote because people get often confuse to whom their voting for, and it might lead to picking the wrong person that would be helping leading this country. On the other hand, the people that agree on keeping the electoral college system say that "" when you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors."" The majoredy of citizens don't even  know who their voting for, imagine their going to be more lost and eventually ending up voting for the wrong person. The electoral college should be remove for good which will allows to have a stable society.

The Electoral college dosen't allow the candidates to come and visit the states. So, you don't even now who you're voting for."" In 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly suceeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy."" What's the point of having privileges to vote, when the segregationist who elect electors are against the president you voted for. What's happen to having free rights, and be able to vote for who you want, and  knowing that he or she would suceed and  lead our country to the right path. By having the electoral college system it is getting rid of those rights. Also the ""2000 fiasco"" was known as the biggest problems we had in the century. Are goal is improving our country not deteriorating it. If we change our election to a popular vote we wouldn't even be in this mess.

Citizen who agree on keeping the electoral college system say that ""electoral votes induces the candidates as we saw in 2012's election to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states."" What wrong with all the states? Are we not part of this country to? Their focusing all their attention on the states that they would be recieving their votes from. Their not even giving other states an opportunity of getting to know their candidates and what their offering to are country on improving it. Another, example is that the electoral college votes relay on larger states. They do that because they know that all their votes are going to come from the bigger states but that's incorrect they should relay on the whole country completely of getting their votes from.

In conclusion, the",0
"No matter what, everyone will have differnet opinions and views on certain situations. Whether it's about what color a dress is, or who should be president, all views are different. When getting advice it is important to see things from all point of views. Listening to multiple peoples advice is very benificial when it comes to desicion making.

Because of every varied opinion there is never just one option. Having more than one choice can help deduce, and choose an opinion that will benifit you the most. An example would be a friend giving you advice to take a shortcut that they discovered to get to school quicker. Another friend tells you that the shortcut is dangerous and that it's not worth it. Two opposing opinions gives you different chances. Say you don't take the shortcut and it takes you longer to get to school. The next day you can try the shortcut to see if its worth it. If it is then you can take the shortcut from then on, if not you take the normal way to school. If one goes wrong you can always try the other.

No one's perfect and sometimes people give bad advice. Having anothers opinion to compare to the someone else's questionable advice to helps you make a better choice. Maybe you break your relatives special vase so you go to a friend for advice. Your friend might tell you to lie about the vase. Another friend tells you to tell the truth. Having those two contrasting opinions helps you to realize that one might be better than the other.

There is no rule that tells you that you only have to follow a singular person's advice. Only yourself knows you the best, but that doesn't mean there is anything wrong with seeking guidance from others. Someone might tell you to add more vegtables into your diet. Someone else might say to add more fruits to your diet. You don't have to do one or the other, creating a compromise between the two opinions can help you create something that will help you, indvidualy, the most.

In conclusion there is many benefits to getting multiple people's opinions. Every point of view is different. Every person you ask advice from are most likely basing their advice on their own past expiernces. Every expierience differs from one person to another. Making every opinion and view completly unique. Seeing all those diffferent opinions helps you make a choice most beneficial to yourself.",0
"Humans have been curious about what is out beyond the sky for a long time. From ancient Greek and Roman astronomers who thought the Earth was the center of the universe, to Galielio who proved them wrong, humans have been wondering about what is truly out there amoung the heavens and the stars. In the ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author, despite the many harrowing ""challenges"" metioned, strongly and effectively supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit, calling to that innate human want to know.

One way he supports this endavor is through scientific logic. He cites how similar Venus is to earth saying, ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too"". One of the best ways to support a point is through factual evidence. By making clear that Venusian exploration makes logical sense, the author strengthens his argument. The fact that Venus is Earth-like and at times very close distance wise to her, makes exploring Venus seem like the next logical step. This scientific backing gives the mission to know more about Venus crediblity and adds a sense of noblitiy, which makes it seem worthy. Without scientific backing it would seem like a far-fetched dream, unworthy of any time or effort.

The author also effectively supports the exploration of Venus through emotional means. He does this by dangling the possibility of life on Venus. He states,""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life"". It is basic human nature to want to not be alone. The want on community drives humans to great lengths to find others like them. Humans have and contiune to cross oceans, battle fields, and other challenging situations in order to not be by themselves. This pursuit for companionship extends to the exploration of Venus. Despite the temperature of Venus's surface being ""over 800 degrees Fahernheit"" and it having an ""atmospheric pressure ... 90 times greater than [Earth's]"" humans are still trying to think of ways to go there on the slim chance that there might be or might have been life there at one point. All in the hopes that humans might not be so alone in this grand universe. By tapping into the basic need and want to not be alone the author makes a strong case for the worthiness of Venusian exploration because many see the search for other life as noble cause and can relate with it.

Another way the author supports his point is by giving expamples of the progress already made and supplying hope. One of the ""challenges"" Venusian exploration faces is the weather on Venus. Venus has ""eurpting vlocanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strkies"". These condtions would frighten anyone. But to combat them, the author informs the reader about a possible solution proposed by NASA of a ""blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape"". In doing so, the author makes the problems seem easier to solve while at the same time providing hope through a possible solution. By showing that the exploration of Venus might indeed be possible that author is able reenforce the worthiness of pursuing Venus. The question changes from ""Can it be done?"" to ""How should it be done?"" which makes it seem like a worthy adventure. The author also give the pursuit hope by diplaying a possible way for it to actually happan. This can get people excited and add to the fervor and want to find out what Venus is really like.

Through the use of scientific logic, emotional motivation, and inspiring hope, the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is able to take an endavor that seems impossible and turn it into a worthy adventure that many can relate with and want to happen. The author taps into human curiousity and exploits it. In the same way the drive to explore the Moon enabled humans to reach new heights, so to does the author depict the study of Venus an epic mission, worthy of adverse challenges humans will face to accomplish it.",0
"First impressions is what I learn from many people. People have many impressions and yes it is hard to change.

Impressions are special to some people but it also could effect people in certain ways. Ways where your whole behavior might change or attitude or maybe your whole person. When we first meet people we see their first impressions and we see on how they are or we check on how their behavior is. We all have a instict on where we look at some people and judge but we also see the attitude in the people. First impressions are special sometimes because you dont know who you are going to meet next and on how they are good or if they have some bad in them.

Everybody is unique in many different ways. People do say that first impressions is impossible to change. I think it's impossible becuase people are very different everybody is different and sometimes we just have to accept it.

Some people don't understand that some people can't change even if its for the better or the worse some people will just always be the same. Impressions are something you can't change from people.",0

"I bielive that this computer system is vauleable because this can tell emotions, it may also help you communicate,and help teachers with students.

This system can reconize your emotions. Many peolpe tend to hide their emotions .In the Mona Lisa she is eighty-three percent happy,nine percent disgusted,six percent fearful,and two percent angry. This computer system software helped the Mona Lisa's emotions,which can help us too. This process begins when the compyter constructs a 3D computer model of the face all fourty four major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Emotion,moving your facialmuscles not only expresses emotions,but it also may even help produce them.

Another reason is this may help you with communication ,this software can help you communicate. In a false smile the mouth is stretched sideways using zygomatic major and a different muscle,the risorius. To an expert,faces don't lie these muscle cluses are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politican or celebrity isnt't being truthful. This helps weather someone fake smiles to you or not. In a real smile the zygomatic major lift the corners of your mouth. This computer system knows if you are faking it.

This software may also help teachers out. This computer system can tell if students are bored in class,or if they are confused .This system can tell teachers that students need more review on the lesson .This may be a great a idea niot only it helps teachers but,human communcation is nonverbal,including emotional communication so computers need to understand that too.

I bielive this is a great idea because,it helps us with our emotions and communicate with others,and help teahers out with students.

This computer software is very benefial for all of us so I agree to this we need to step our game up,and know what peolpe feel by the help of theses great system we have.",0
"This piece is about why scientist should explore Venus. The author supported his or her claim of exploring Venus well. The author provides evidence to counter Venus's harsh conditions.

The author gives many reasons why Venus is a dangerous planet. For example, the author says that there is a thick atmosphere that is 97 percent carbon dioxide, not only that but the clouds are highly corrosive with sulfuric acid. The surface temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the pressure is 90 times that of Earth's. The author also mentions that the geology and weather is chaotic as well. The author manages to give some evidence for each of the dangers of Venus. He or she states that scientists can hover thirty-some miles above the surface to avoid geological and most weather hazards. It is also said that hovering up high will decrease the temperature down to about 170 degrees Fahrenheit and the pressure to Earth's sea level. This gives the idea that a human survivng on Venus is not easy but possible. The author gives that fact that NASA is currently working on electronics that can withstand Venus's surface, and the longest it has lasted is three weeks, so scientists can gather artifacts from Venus and study them.

The author provides evidence in that scientists are currently working to combat Venus's harsh conditions. The evidence present shows that it is possible to counter the planet's harsh conditions and also how close the humans are to being able to explore Venus.",0
The story of Making Mona Lisa Smile is about a Prof named Thomas Huang making a computer that can tell your emotions and the way you are feeling that day. You might not be the mood for anything and the computer can tell when your bored or not feeling anything it will modify the way it work so you will be in a better mood i think its great. Beacuse kids might not fall asleep in class as much if thcomputer sees it and will fix it and it will help whats wrong with people. Part of me say its a bad idea becuase most people dont like talking about their emotions so that will make things worse if a computer does it and feel their emotions . Its pretty cool through how it can read your face and all 44 major muscles on your face. I would say no to it becuase i myself and like telling my emotions about things and dont a computer telling me about them,0
"Do you ever wonder if asking more than one person for advice can help someone make a better choice? I think asking more than one person for advice can help someone make a better choice because they get multiple options to choose from. Another reason why I think asking more than one person for advice can help someone make a better choice is because advice can be hard to get from only one person. Another reason why asking more than one person for advice can help someone make a better choice is because advice from more than one person gives you more advice to think about. Getting advice from more then one person is a better choice because you have multiple options, it can be hard to get from only one person, and it gives you more then one idea.

Asking more than one person for advice can help them make a better choice because they have multiple options to choose from. Having multiple options can help someone make a better choice because they might not agree with someone. It could also help someone because they could choose one that they like and dislike because they have multiple options to choose from. For example if I needed advice for high school and I ask multiple people, I could choose which advise I liked the most. Another example would be If I needed advice on how to get good grades at school and I ask multiple people if I don't agree on what someone else said I could agree with someone else and take their advice.

Advice can be hard to get from only one person because you need to get other people's advice on what you need advice on. Another reason why advice can be hard to get from one person is because you also need to get more than one persons opinion. For example if I ask my friend for advice and she gives advice and I don't like it, I would go to someone else because I didn't like the advice she gave to me. Another example would be if I ask someone for advice and they give it to me and I don't like it I would go to someone else. That is why it's important to get advice from more than one person because you might have not liked the advice someone gave to you so you go to another person.

Getting advice from more then one person gives you more advice ideas to think about. For example if I ask someone for advice and I ask someone else and they both give me great advice I can have two advice to think about. Another example would be I ask multiple people for advice and they give me advice and I like both of the advice multiple advice to think about. Getting more then one opinion can help someone make a better choice because they have more then one advice to think about and they can choose which advice they like the most. Getting advice give you more ideas to think about.

Advice can be hard to choose from, but asking multiple people can make it easy because you have different options to choose from. Sometimes when people give you advice you might not agree with them, but the more people you ask the more advice you get, and the more advice you can choose from. In my opinion asking more than one person for advice is a better choice because you get different answers from people. When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than on person because they need to get more then one opinion. Asking more than one person for advice is a better choice.",0
"For a long time now we have been fighting against global warming and polution. Some people why we cant just end the fight quickly. And the reason is simply because we still rely so much on cars. All people need to find so type of way to stop using cars as much. There are some places that are already starting to limit uses. Like in Vauban, Germany who has a ban on cars, Paris, France who can use certain cars on certain days, and bogota, Colombia.

One way people could limit their use of cars is if they did something like what Vauban, Germany did. Build cities that had no drive ways and no parking lots. That way people had to buy parking garage spots that cost alot of money. According to source one passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse emissions in Europe. Many will think this is not alot but think about how much polution there is, then find out how twelve percent is it will be alot. But when these types of cities are made there will be a reduce in the emissions because little if any cars we be driven here. In source one Heidrun Walter said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" This showes that without cars in people life it removes a tremondus amount of stress. People dont have to worry about spending money on gas or they don't have to worry about paying large amounts of money for their car to be fit. When there is not so much money at stake you tent to be a little less tense. Obvously creating a city were you have to buy a parking garage spot to hold your car would be a great idea because it would reduce the amount of polution being released and it would make the people living in the city less stressed.

Another ways people could limit the use of cars is if they do something like Paris, France does. They placed a ban on cars with odd numbered licens plates on Mondays, And placed a ban on cars with even numbered licens plates on Tuesdays. They did this because they were having record breaking amounts of polution being released. They were releasing more polution than Beijing, China who is the leading city in polution. But according to article two Paris found a sixty percent decrease in polution in just five days of this even odd ban. This means they lost more than half of the cities polution by limiting the cars on Monday to only even licens and limiting the cars to only odd licens on Tuesday. Cleary this is a very effective method of reducing the amount of cars being used.

A third way cars could be used less is if you have no car days like bogota, Colombia has. In article three Carlos Arturo Plaza says ""It's a good way to take away stress and lower air polution."" He is saying that cars a cause for polution and doing this day is a good way of lowering polution rates. This source also stated that other cities in Columbia like Cali and Valledpar are joining in this event. It is also said that other country leaders go to Colombia to watch this event. Afterwards they say the event is awesome. This means that not only is the event spreading across Colombia, but it could possibly spread to other countries as well. Without a doubt this is another effective way to limit the use of cars.

It is clear that cars are a problem. But many people use them anyway, but what they don't think about is how much they are contributing to polution. Some ways to limit car usage are create cities where you have to pay for a place to store you car, have and even odd licens day, and have no car days.",0
"The face on Mars was actually landform on mars and not a face if you still don't believe me I'll tell you some facts. In 1976 viking 1 was snapping pictures so that viking 2 could land while doing that it snapped a picture of a landform that looked like a face. Many people thought that it was a face but it wasn't. In 1998 they took another pivture but this time it didn't look like a face it looked more like a landform on the ground. Many people thought that the landform was created by aliens many others thought that it was made just like land forms on earth.

People still thought thet they were made by aliens many other people disagreed on it until 2001 when they took the final picture and they saw that it was actually a landform Garvin said that it reminded he of snake river of Idaho.

So after that happened mny people saw the truth about the face on mars and completely forgot about it. Some people still believe and talk about it but maybe those people are just the scientists trying to find out if there is more land forms that look just like the onein 1976. Many people say that they might find another one and start the arguement that it's an alien artifact or that it's just a land mass this time. Many other people study about this things and think they find out the truth about ehy this landforms look like faces. Even though some people think there is life on mars some might be true and some of it might be fake. Some people think there is aliens but maybe in another galaxy.

Many people might still think that mars landform was a sign form aliens and saying that they exist personally I don't think there is aliens in mars or any other planet in our solar system. That was just my idea about it I don't think my statement could be true. Maybe smart kid like a nerd would say "" scientists who are studying this kind of martian studies could get results of a real life alien that could be roaming around earth"". That's what I would think a nerd would say or maybe he might just say it even smarter than I said it, but that is my opinion I would like to hear about more peoples opinions on the face on mars. Even though many other people will just argue over that it was a face but maybe the aliens destroyed it or just abducted it like they do in boring fake movies of aliens but that's my opinion not you if you don't agree with me it's fine with me.",0
"As for cell phones, Cell phone use while driving statistics show that how this behavior are common and dangerous for teen drivers. During cell phones while driving, 1.2 million car crashes back in 2013 that involved drivers talking on the phone, and also involving text messaging. Cell phone use while driving statistics and texting and driving facts may help a lot of families manage this dangerous at its risk. Texting while driving and other cell phone use while driving statistics show that this multitasking behind the wheel is becoming threatening norm. Talking or texting while driving or checking on social media post can take your brain off task while driving. Coupled with inexperienced and lack of driving skills, cell phones can be deadly for teen drivers.

Technology will change and new distractions will be introduced, parents need to be sure and be careful and explain to the teens to understand the value of engaged driving, where the driver is continuously attentive and focused. Make a commitment for teens not to use distracting devices while driving. Teens who do not frequently use a phone while driving believe the benefits of putting away their phone while driving any drawbacks. The benefits associated with not using a cell phone that includes, being able to pay better attention, being less likely to crash, and following the law. Texting and driving are really are really unhealthy for teens which can lead to death or a lot of trouble.

According to integrity insurances, traffic safety administration, texting behind the wheel takes a driver's eye off the road for an average of 4.6 seconds, which is the time it takes to go from one end zone to another. Texting while driving has now replaced drinking and driving as the leading cause of death of teenage drivers. Teens are not the only ones that are just guilty. According to the survey, conducted by AT&T, 49 percent of American adult drivers admitted they text while driving. In that same survey, their model predicted text messaging while being involved in 6-60 percent of all accidents in the U.S. High school students who experienced these types of accident are very terrifying for texting and driving. Typing text messages reduce a driver ability at a certain direction to the roadway, to respond to important traffic events and also control a vehicle while in the lane and to also show respect to other vehicles.",0
"Dear state senator,

I think that we should get ride of the elecoral college because its not what people want. The popular votes lets you pick which president you want. The electoral college is when you pick your candidate but your picking a elector and they bring in the votes. The people that vote should be able to pick who they want and then yea. So we should have popular votes then keeping the electoral college. So we need a popular vote and not a electoral college where you dont actually vote, you vote for a elector and then you tell them which candidate you vote for and then they bring in the votes. For exaple, if i would to say that the candiadates are George washington and john kerry and i pick george and 34 others pick him the elector would bring 35 votes to the congress and then he would have 35 votes. You dont know the electors you dont know anything.",0
"The Electoral Collage has been around for a long time. Every few years, voters go to vote on election day and their vote can either mean everything or nothing. There are many flaws with the Electoral Collage: it serves an outdated purpose, popular vote does not matter, and there is the possibility of the disaster factor. Using the Electoral Collage could lead to undesired consequences.

Back in the times in which the Electoral Collage was founded, commutation between the colonies was not quick. News could take months to arrive, and with the Electoral Collage, if news about a presidential candidate came out that made him a threat, for example if he was a murderer, the electors would know that and, despite what the voters thought, not to vote for him. In the current times, as soon as something had happened that would make a candidate look bad, it would not be very long before such news would be on T.V., social media Facebook, Twitter, etc.,and on the radio. So unless someone wasn't paying much attention, every vote should be valid.

With the Electoral Collage system, the vote of an individual does not matter. Whether three people in a state vote or threemillion vote, as long as a majority only 51% of the votes vote for the candidate, that candidate gets all the electoral votes for that state. If only 51% of people vote for a candidate he wins that state, that leaves 49% of people in that state whose votes are now discredited. Eventually, like in some cases such as the election in 2000, it can add up that a candidate wins the popular vote, the actual majority, but not the election. So despite the wishes of the majority, the other candidate in this situation would win.

When a candidate wins all the electoral votes for a state, those votes are sent to electors so that they can vote on behalf of the people, or not. ""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. So that a popular vote for Kennedy.""""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses are wrong,"" Bradford Plumer Not only an incident such as this could occur, but electors of two slates could be sent to congress and chose not to vote as asked. With all these flaws, why are we still using the Electoral Collage?

The Electoral Collage no longer serves the purpose it once did, and it is now doing more harm than good. Back when it was established, it did what was needed for the time. This is a new era, it's time for a new system.",0
"I am agree with students to use their cell phone in the classroom because some students came to the United State with not knowing any words in English, and even of a student that born in the United State or their native language is English can get to forget the meaning of a word in English. For instance, cellphones or another type of device.

And it can drive you to many type of option which is very good! if you are not clear in the first option you can jump to the second option or third option if needed.

Some students came to the United State without speaking English which mean is so bad, and they don't know how to communicate with teachers so they are likely to uses their cellphone for translating words. I was one of the student that came to United State without speaking any English, and teachers can't speak Spanish too, so I was able to use my phone for translate words to my language, it was helping a lot to communicate with other students that only speaks English. In another reason, I daily uses my phone because it is easy to carrying It in the hallway instead of a big dictionary, and some dictionary does not contain the word that you looking for . Beyond of that, in the cellphone you just need to download the dictionary app or go the Google web and type easily the word that you need to fine information for.

Therefore, cellphones can give many way to you how to understand the word specially the Google web site it can give you pictures, or it can led you to a video link where you can see resources that are explaining the meaning of the word or different manner that they can be clear at the point. I use Google a lot of time because has everything that the dictionary can not be included for example, Google translate can tell you the pronunciation, quickly to research, and even if it is bad it will tell you the meaning besides that if you don't know how to spell the word it contains an option where you can talk to the cellphone which is a lovely option to use.

However, cellphones is a almighty thing to be used in the classroom to help students knowledge or everywhere. beside, been smart and having powerful resource we can learn from cellphones to do many things as some teachers want us to use our cellphones for Wikipedia, kahhot , dictionary web, and googlecassroom for reading , writing or gave us homework throw it.

As we can know already cellphone is very useful for this options too. calling ,sending message, receiving message , set remainder, multiple resource, ects.

Despite of each year is advancing many students at the among of age 12 or 15 years old have a phone or a tablet device which is fine to have. Then, If needed teachers can work in an online website to gave them homework to do at home or working in classroom. And some point, approximate all people have their cellphones in their bag, and easy to care and some people have said that the cellphones is like their friend.

finally, which I did understand that cellphones is necessary needed to use in the classroom which is helping to translate word in another language and cellphones can give you many certain information, idea how to be specific in the word that you are looking for. And also, it can have a different variety of information and some teachers will ask for it during the class, if you have one . And is a small size it is easy to carry, And is an important device to carry everywhere.          ",0
"Cell Phones and Driving

Should you be permitted to drive a vehicle while using a device? In this case you shouldn't because it comes with many risks while you're on the road. You put yourself in danger while putting other drivers in danger as well. You risk your life with others on the line too!!!!

To begin with it's a big distraction on the road. When you choose to text and drive, you're threatening every single driver around you and placing more value on that text message than yourself and your fellow drivers. You tend to check your phone so much which can cause you to crash with someone else. But also take the focus of your surroundings while driving. It takes your focus away from safe driving. One single text can make a blink of an eye change your life of someone else's life. Also when you're engulfed in a texting conversation, it's easy to forget you're sharing the road with other people. It also takes your hands off the steering wheel to answer one single text.

Another reason that driving while using a device should be allowed is because it is illegal. You get pulled over and get a ticket. But also if caught many times can cause those digits tickets to go up which means big money tickets. It can also rise in auto insurance rates. It can lead up to prison time as well .Is it worth risking your freedom?

More so, is it worth the emotional damage a car accident causes to everyone involved?

Also it leads to getting your license suspended. The consequences you'll face for texting and driving are similar to those you'd get for another one of the most serious driving offenses which is a DUI.

A third reason that using a device while driving shouldn't be allowed is because it can have huge risks. Sending or replying to a text requires that you remove at least one hand from the steering wheel so that you can grip your phone and thumb in a reply. So not only are you multitasking and not focusing your eyes from the road, but you're also trying to deftly use your phone with one hand while at the same time steer your vehicle. So not only do you risk crashing with other vehicles but also losing the steering wheel which is the control of driving the vehicle.

Being able to use a device while operating a vehicle shouldn't be allowed. It brings too many risks and changes to the environment of driving. There would be a lot of accidents on the highway due to having access to a device while driving. Would you want a family member or friend to be on the road with someone so oblivious to the traffic around them? Remember, every time you get behind the wheel, you're entering a shared experience with mothers, fathers, friends, and children. It is every driver's responsibility to always be careful and attentive, ensuring everyone can safely get from Point A to Point B. Which is why driving with a device on your hand shouldn't be allowed.",0
"Valubale FACS Technology in the Classroom

FACS is an acronym for the new technology named Facial Action Coding System. It enables computers to identify human emotions. This technology is quite interesting and also complex. Dr. Huang predicts ""A classroom computer could recognnize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". He says that by knowing that we as students are bored the computer would ""modify the the lesson like an effective human instructor.""

I believe that FACS, the new technology of facial action coding, would be very effective and valuable in the classroom. I know that as a student reading a so called ""never ending"" article causes me to become sleepy and uninterested. With the modification of the lesson, I think that it will enhance the attention given to the lesson. Students are struggling so much as ADD and ADHD seem to have been on the rise or rather the diagnoses or those things. Students become uninterested when they don't think that it will benefit them or their future and when they have to read a lot of material that's dry. If attention to the lesson is heightened grades will more than likely raise as heighten as well.

In conclusion, I believe that a Facial Action Coding System would be nice to have in the classroom and would bring a lot more interest back into school work. At the end of the article the author stated ""Whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions!"" That being said, I think that another claim could be ""Whoever thought that making faces finally worked after all these years and we get someone who cares enough to make our lessons interesting"". So many students around me and I know that other students in other areas don't even care about school anymore because they don't feel that their opinion about what they learn matters and it's sad that a computer software program has to do it instead of our leaders and teachers but as long as we get what we need and as long and our grades go up I find this FAC system to be amazing software to put into the school systems.",0
"Many people think that this is a alien formed face noooo. I claim that this is a natural landform. We have taken many pictures and it has faded away more every time we take a picture of it. There are some many reasons of how this face was a natural landform.

First, This natrual landform was not form by alein becuase in the pictures you see a small mountain or big hill , but here in the USA, there are many of thoes big hills or small mountains. They are mostly around the American west. It is a lava dome that are on the USA too. and they are the same height. So that face on that hill is not alone.

Next, Another reason on how that natrual landform is natural not made by aliens is that every time we take a picture over the years the face is always fadeding away so if an alien created it why would he just leave it there just to faded away.

They would of kept it alive.

Last, I can see on how somebody could think this was formed by an alien but how do you explain that the eyes are just shadows. They are formed from the nearby rock. Plus the mouth and nose are also formed by the nearby rock shadow. So the mouth, nose and eyes are not really even there they are just shadows

In conclusion, I am telling the alien face that was on mars was just a lava dome. And its eyes nose mouth were just shadows. Plus the picture just started fading away through the years. This is how the Face was not made by aleins but was a natural landform",0
"The Face on Mars is just a natural landform. This is not a face created by aliens. The picture taking in 1998 revealed it was a natural landform, if NASA would have said it was aliens they would recieve more funding, however they said it was an illusion of a face, and in 2001 the picture taken clearly shows that it is a natural landform.

In 1998 NASA captured a pictue of the face as soon as they could get a good shot at it. The picture revealed that it was just a natural landform, just like NASA had said in 1976. Also, when the original picture was taken in 1976 it was revealed to be an illusion of a face by NASA. If NASA chose to call the landform work done by aliens, they would recieve more funding. However, NASA was very truthful in there fundings and they didn't have any reason besides the truth to say it was a natural landform. Finally, the clearest pictue of it taken in 2001 clearly shows a natural landform that couldn't be mistaken for anything else. A quote from the article is,""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters compared to the 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. 'As a rule of thumb, you can dicern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,' he added, 'So, if there where objects in this picture like airplanes... or Egyptian-style pyramids... you could see what they were!'"" This quote proves that the best picture ever taken so far of the Face clearly shows that it is a natural thing. The natural landform could not be mistaken as anything else in the pictures we have.

It is clear that the Face is a natural landform because the picture in 1998 revealed it, NASA comfired it was a natural thing which caused them to not get extra funding, and the picture taken in 2001 is the clearest one we have and it is very obvious that it is a natural landform. These reason show how the Face is a natural landform and not an alien made thing.",0
"The author suggests that studying Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because ""Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally imtimidation endeavor."" I know this because in the text it says ""NASA has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus."" In the article it also says ""referred to as Earth's ""twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too.""

In the article it also says ""NASA is working on other approches to studying Venus. This is why the author suggest to study about Venus.

Venus is a identical twin to Earth because Venus in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closesy in distance too. I know this because in the article it says ""Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds."" Another reason would be because ""scientists disscus further visits to its surface."" Final reason is because both Earth and Venus are very identical and scientist plan to expand human life and have people start studying Venus. This is why Earth is identical to Venus.

NASA is approching to studying Venus because of its Atmosphere. I know this because in the article it says ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could of have supported Various forms of life."" Another reason would be because ""NASA's possible solutions to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."" Final reason would be ""scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand would need to get up close and personal despite the risks."" This is why NASA is approching to study Venus.

"Scientists are striving to meet the challenge of exploring the dangerous planet of Venus. Scientist believe that long ago Venus may have supported various forms of life. Looking up at Venus from Earth is a safe distance to visualize the planet since it is very challenging to examine it more closely. The author suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. These dangers include the enviroment, but it is worthy pursuit becuase it part of human curiosity, and innovation.

The atmosphere of Venus is very harmful since it is coated by a thick blankets of carbon dioxide, almost 97 percent of the atmosphere is coated.""Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere""(paragraph 3).

The temperature are also extreme on Venus. The average temperatures are over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the pressure is 90 time greater that what we experience on earth. This pressure can crush a submarine. The temperature can liquefy many metals. Venus has eurpting volcanoes, earthquakes, and lightning strikes. Venus is now an inhospital to any form of life.

Human curiosity drives scientist eagerly to explore this planet despite of the many danger is upholds. Many scientist believe that Venus could have a been able to support life long time ago. ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans."" (paragraph 4). Scientists also believe that Venus can be be our nearest option for a planetary visit. NASA has an idea for sending humans to study Venus. Many forms of light cannot penatrate the dense atmosphere so we cannot takepictures, nor can they take rock,gas, or anything else.

Landing and exploring Venus can lead to innovation for humans. NASA is looking for more solution to be able to study Venus. They are testing out old technology so they can combine it with new technology like the computer. These experiences can innovate many other technology so that we can explore venus. In paragraph 7 it states tha ""these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all "".

In conclusion there are many challenges that make things difficult to explore Venus. There is a purpose to explore Venus. NASA is trying to still pursuit solutions to these challenges so that human might actually have a chance to explore this dangerous but amazing planet. So when you look up at the ""Evening Star"" just think about the fasicnating planet that once might have supported life but also remind yourself that this is now a hostile planet that scientist hope that someday they can explore.",0
"All across the globe, a revolutionary idea is being set in motion. The idea of essentially banning cars from the streets has sparked as much interest as it has critics. The automotive industry has been booming since World War 2, and although the positive effects of cars can be seen in our daily lives, we seldom take into consideration of the negative impacts of cars. Effects such as pollution, traffic, and cost have impacted our lives as automotive users, even if we have not realized it.

Pollution is one of the primary concerns of a world that is constantly driving, yet it is something people hardly take into account when driving. In theory that is understandable, considering the last thing a person is thinking about when they're driving is what their car is spitting out into the atmosphere. However pollution doesn't go unnoticed for long. For example, the city of Paris, France enforced a partial driving ban in order to decrease the almost record breaking pollution across the city, stating, ""The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."" The smog did clear from the city and previous driving laws were reinstated, however this shows how car pollution has a negative impact on the world around us.

Another negative impact of driving is traffic. Traffic is a driver's worst nightmare, and it affects all of us at some point in our lives. In Bogota, Columbia, citizens participated in a drivingfree day, where everyone was encouraged to either hike, bike, skate, or use public transportation in order to reach their destination. This event, in which millions of Colombians participated, was reportedly ""leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" This program left a positive mark on the city of Bogota, and will hopefully soon spread to other countries, reducing crowded, traffic filled streets around the world.

The world runs on money, just ask any Wall Street broker. This is a paradox concerning both car owners and people looking to purchase a car. The question remains, if we're all trying to save money, why spend thousands of dollars on a costly car? According to a census taken in 2013, ""Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cashstrapped Americans could not afford cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway."" This shows that the number of people buying cars is steadily decreasing. Another costly problem of cars is fuel. Buying gasoline for your car every week can get incredibly costly, especially when driving a large truck or sports car. This shows how the cost of cars can have a negative impact on our lives.

In conclusion, the use of cars is steadily declining. Cars just aren't a very positive motive for transportation anymore considering the effects of pollution, traffic, and cost that cars produce.",0
"Dear, senator I hereby to inform you that I'm in favor of changing the election by popular vote for the president of the United Staes, the kind we have now. For many reasons we believe the Electoral College should be abolish due to the process of electing the next president. During the Electoral College voters tend to vote but, not vote for the president, but for a slate of electors, who turn to elect the president. We believe that over 60 percent of voters would prefer an election the kind we have now, as I said before. As you know the Electoral College consist of 538 electors, making it a majority of 270 electoral votes to elect the President. Californa, making it the state with the most electoral votes, is a state that could rise a candidates votes, and is considered by the following candidates that California could be an enormous help for the candidate. Many voters have many questions regarless to the Electoral Vote, for example; can voters control whom, their electors vote for? Nor who picks the electors in the 1st place?, These are a few questions that many voters have. I believe we should forment and focous more on the popular vote of those who are qualified citizens. The biggest disaster with the electoral college was when the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century, therefore making state legislatures responsible for picking electors. During an electoral college vote, if the electoral vote ends in a tie, the election would be held in the House of Reprsentatives, whereas state delegations would vote on the president. Candidates don't get to spend time in the states they know, having a chance of not winning. As a result of that, in the 2000 campaign, approximately seventeen states didn't have the oppurtunity to see the candidates. On the other hand the electoral college avoids the problem of elections. Therefore i considerate the electoral collge vote unfair to voters.",0
"When you ask for advice most of the time you usually ask more than one person. It will be better to ask different people to see what their opinion on the situation is. It will probably make you happy with the advice that they will give you. You would have also talked to multiple people and you might agree with what they have said. If you ask multiple people they might help you make a better choice. When you ask for advice it is better when you ask multiple people because some people will be older, some people might know you longer, and you will have different options.

First, on when you ask for advice why it's better to ask older people. For example, they will be more wiser than other people. Another example is, they might have more experience with the situation. Since they are older and they might understand you more. Also, they have more knowledge since they are are older. So they will know more and they will help you more. They will also probably help you make a better choice.

Second, on when you ask for advice why it's better to ask people that know you longer. For example, you probably talk to them all the time because they know you longer. So they will probably have good advice to give you. Another example is, they know you more because they know you more they will give you good advice. Also, you see them all the time. So they can probably tell when you need advice before you know that you need advice.

Lastly, on when you ask people for advice it is better to ask different people because it gives you different options. For example, you will see different peoples points of view in the situation. Another example is, they won't be bias on the advice they will give you. They won't be giving you the advice that you want to hear they will give you the advice that they think is better for you. Also, you will also have different options to choose from.

In conclusion, it is better to ask multiple people for advice because some people will be older, some people might know you longer, and you will have different options of advice. Multiple people will have given you different advice. You will also not be as stressed because you have talked to multiple people and they all gave you advice. You would also probably be more satisfied with the advice people have given you. This is why it's better to ask different people for advice. They will also make sure that you make a better choice with the advice that they gave you.",0
"The Face, a discovery on Mars. It was dicovered on 1976 and it was complicated to predict what it actually was. It was explored when NASA's Viking 1 was snapping photos of possible land places for the ship Viking 2.

When it was revealed to be a natural landform, not everyone was happy with it. The Face should be considered a natural landform.

I claim that it's a natural landform because it can be found on this earth. It wouldn't be a natural landform if it was not possible to find it anywhere. To confirmed it's identity, Mars global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet in September 1997 after 18 years of the discovery. Jim Garvin, chief scientist of NASA's MGS stated, ""We felt is was important to taxpayers. We photographed the Face as soon as could get a good shot at it."" This senteces here shows how important is was to identify the Face.

On April 5, 1998, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture that is ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. After they snapped photos of the Face, it was later revealed to be a natural landform. There was no alien monument after taking a look at the pictures. According to the text, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all"" (Unmasking the Face on Mars,7). Many people disagreed that is wasn't a natural landform, but an alien.

The camera used to take the picture wasn't an ordinary camera. It was the aboslute best camera at that time and it zoom in three times bigger than the pixel size. Some might argue that it could be hidden by a haze or mistaken, but it was looked over for the second time and it was confirmed to be a natural landform twice. If you were to use the camera that they used, you can identify any objects such as an airplane or Eygpt pyramid on Mars.

Overall, the Face is a natural landform. The landform is common around American West. Garvin stated, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" It's comparing a real landform to the Face. The Face today can be considered a natural landform.",0
"Dear State Senator, I think we should get rid of the electoral college because they are unfair. There are only a few reasons to why we need the electoral college. I think we should get rid the college because it is a non democratic method of selecting our president. It should be overruled by declaring the candidate who got the most popular votes. Its the electors who select the president not the people. When you vote, you are actually voting for a slate of electors.

Another reason why would get rid of the electoral college is because of the winner takes all system. Canadiates dont spend time in the states they know have no chance of winning. They only focused on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states did not see the the candidates at all including Rhode Island and South carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets did not see a single campaign.

It can be argued that the electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state, demo crates in texas, or reblicans in California for example. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign thean they would have if the president were picked by popular vote... The voters in presidential elections are people who to want to express a political preferance rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.

Whats wrong the electoral College?

When we are under the electoral College system , voters vot not for the president, but they vote for slate of electors. For example if you lived in texas and wanted to vote for John kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the off chance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to congress and Kerry would get 34 electorial votes. These electors could be anyone not holding public office. Plus voters can not control who the electors vote for. Voters end up getting confused because of the candidates the electors vote for.",0
"As we all know cars are a big part of our society today. However cars have a bigger impact than we think. Some people can't live without there car. Some people can go their whole life without a car. We may not think about it however there are multiple advantages to not using a car. When we limit our car use it saves the earth also it i said that it takes away a heap load of stress and it saves people money. Just think about it, one day without the use of cars. How would that be?

We we think of saving the earth we think of recycling, reusing things, and reducing. Did you know that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gases and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States.(According to ""In German Surburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" By: Elisabeth Rosenthal). In Paris there pollution was almost record setting and so they ordered that even-numbered license plates leave their cars at home or pay a fine of $31. Almost 4000 drivers were fined that day  and 27 got their cars impounded. Most of the cars in Paris are diesel ran so the smog is worse. If they would cut down on their car use it would lower the smog.

You might not think of it but if we limited the use of cars it relieves stress. According to ""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"", In Vauban, Germany they have given up their cars. Vaubans streets are completly car free. 70 percfent of Vauban's families do not own cars ansd 57 percent sold a car to move there. Heidrun Walter said""When I had a car I was always tense. Im much happierthis way"". According to ""Car-free dat in spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky in Bogota,Columbia they have been without cars for 3 years. Also Carlos Arturo Plaza said ""It's a good opportunit totake awat stresss and lower the air pollution"".

According to ""The End of Car Culture"" by: Elisabeth Rosenthal recent studies show that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licences as each year goes by. The number of miles driven in the United States  peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily afterwards, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Adivor Perspectives. People who stopped driving there cars as a result of hard times may not find a reason to go back to driving if they are saving money.

So I believe that they're many reason to have a car. However they're many advantages to limiting your car use. You can think of yourself as doing a good deed to the earth when walking somewhere or riding your bike are catching the bus. You can have a clear mind and seize stressing so much. Also you can save money I think that everybody likes to save money one way or another. Instead of drivng your car to the mall you can save that money and catch the bus to the mall and buy that new purse that you have been dying to get.",0
"There are several advantages of limiting car usage. A couple of them are that there would be less pollution in the air and that communities would be set up different to make it easier to get to places without having to drive to these place you could just walk instead.

One advantage of limiting car usage is that there would be less pollution. Source 4 says, ""If the pattern persits and many sociologists believe it will it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions."" This shows that if you cut out some of your car usage there will be less carbon in the air. Which would lead to less pollution and a better living environment for everybody. Source 3 says, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" The person who said this was talking about the car free day that occurs in Colombia. Going just one day without your car can have an impact on the carbon emissions and help bring down the amount of air pollution in that area.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is new community set ups. Source 1 says, ""But it's basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway."" This shows that the government is willing to set up the community in a different way to limit the amount of car usage on a daily basis. Which also makes your shopping trips more convinant because the stores you need or want to go to are walking distance from your house. Source 3 says, ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. This explains how the city is being remodeled to help encourage people to start using their cars less and to be able to walk to many places instead of driving there by bringing these places closer to their houses.

There are several advantages of limiting car usage. A couple of them are that there would be less pollution in the air and that communities would be set up different to make it easier to get to places without having to drive to these place you could just walk instead.

There are several advantages of limiting car usage. A couple of them are less pollution and new community set ups.",0
"Dear my. senator The Electoral college process consists of 538 electorss. Each electors represents a state and they vote according to what the majority of the people favor. The Electoral college is a fair and honest way of electing the president because each individual has a voice in who is elected by voting for the state electorss.""You help choose your state's electorss when you vote for president because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electorss""Does the Electoral College Work?. This shows how everyone plays a key role in the government and in electing the main person in charge.

Many people may argue that the Electoral college is corrupt because it is a ""nondemocratic"" way of electing a president and that the electorss may not vote in favor of the people's majority. This is true, however,""that trust is rarely betrayed""Does the Electoral College Work?."" It is entirely possible that the winner of the electorsal vote will not win the national poular vote""Does the Electoral College Work?, but this too has rarely happened. We need to continue with the Electoral college process despite a couple rarely occurring cons because all of the reasons to retain this fair system heavily outways the negative. There are five main arguments to continue the use of this justified system.

The first reason is ""certainty of outcome."" A conflict over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is rare and less likely to occur than a dispute over the popular vote. "" The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote""Does the Electoral College Work?. A tie in the nationwide electorsal vote is also highly unlikely to occur.

This second argument is ""Everyone's president."" ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal""Does the Electoral College Work?. This is so the residents of other regions don't feel deserted and that their votes don't count. Every president should have this desirable result so that heshe can be a successful president.

The third main argument is ""Swing States."" ""The winnertakeall mathod of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates to focus their campaign efforts on the tossup states....voters in tossup states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign""Does the Electoral College Work?. These electorsal voters are likely to be the most thoughtful voters and should be able to decide the election.

The fourth reason to retain the Electoral College system is that ""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large statesby population lose by virtue of the malapportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution""Does the Electoral College Work?. A large state would get more attention than a small state and I think that this is fair because the larger states by population should get more votes because they contain more people.

The fifth and final reason that we as a nation should favor the Electoral College is because it ""avoids runoff elections.""The Electoral College avoids the problems of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast""Does the Electoral College Work?. The Electoral College takes the huge pressure off of runoff elections and clearly produces a winner.

I hope that you take into consideration what I said and help the Electoral College continue to thrive over the years because without this system the nation will be in a big dispute. I know that this is the best system for our country and state and I strongly hope that you see that too.",0
"The discovery of the Face on the surface of Mars was thrilling for the public. As a scientest working for NASA, I am constantly debating with others whether or not the Martian mesa commonly referred to as the Face was created by aliens. Many people think that it was created by aliens. However, I disagree with the fact that the Face might have been created by aliens. It is simply another Martian mesa located in the region known as Cydonia.

One of the main reasons the Face was not created by aliens is because there are multiple Martian mesas throughout Cydonia. Martian mesas are commonly found throughout Cydonia, and it would be logical to think that the Face is just another Martian mesa. The only difference between the Face and other Martian mesas is that the Face contains unusual shadows making it look like an actual human face.

Not only are Martian mesas commonly found in Cydonia, pictures taken by spacecrafts have proven that the Martian mesa does not look like a face. Although many people have said that the photo taken by the Viking 1 in 1976 resembles a face, unusual shadows made the Martian mesa take the appearance of a human face. Also, the photo taken in 1976 by the Viking 1 does not have very good resolution. In order to see the Face, the photo taken in 1998 by the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) had to be taken through wispy clouds which has led some skeptics to believe that the alien marking were hidden by haze. However, the photos taken in 2001 by the Mars Global Surveyor are much clearer and have much better resolution. These photos reveal the truth about the Face; it is just another Martian Mesa.

In addition to the fact that the photos reveal the truth, it would be illogical for NASA to keep life on Mars a secret. If NASA was to announce to the public that life on Mars has been found, it would significantly help NASA. More people would support NASA and hope more would be discovered about the life found on Mars and would encourage the government to provide NASA with large amounts of money to learn even more about life on Mars.

Although it would have been cool to know that the Face was created by aliens, there is too much proof to support the fact that it is just another Martian mesa. With such advanced technology in use today, NASA will hopefully make huge discoveries in the near future.",0
"Would you like someone deciding what's best for you or take matter into your own hands? Well in my opinion people should make there own decisions because they can decide how they want things and what makes them happy in there own way even though some would argue that, people should seek guidance from experts and authorities because some times they know whats best for us and our own health. Yes, sometimes when you seek for guidance they help you out a lot and lead you to the right path. They also, help you find whats happy but its not like if your doing it because you want your just doing it to better yourself and your not doing what you want your doing what your told.

Deciding what u want probably is what's best since your going at your own paste, your taking it how you want. your going at your own paste with things. Also, no one can stop you from doing what you believe is best for you. You can find your own ways to cope with things without anyone telling you other wise. Going at your own pace is better then getting rushed, doing what you dont want, and doing what your told even. However, getting help pushes you to do it better.

Seeking guidance isnt bad at all either you get the help you need, you get that push forward to bettering yourself. Sometimes in life there are moments where your not your best help and you need a hand. Theres nothing ever wrong with getting a little help. You sometimes need a hand to understand your values to get to recognize them and meet them.

we all have different life matters because we all dont care about the same thing. we all care about different things. your life important matters are valuable and there something that only you can decide on not any one else. Sure, our values all are different in every type of way thats the reason to why we should decide on our own why our life matters are important. thats why in my opinion people should make there own decisions, find out there matters, what there good at and what the things that they value are.",0
"limiting the usage of cars can solve many things in the world such as lessening the producton of greenhouse gases. it states in the article that greenhouse gases can reach up yo 50% in  some areas of the u. s. when it is only 12% in Europe, these numbers are absolutely insane.

meanwhile in places like BOGOTA, columbia they are taking place in such things as a car free day. the article also states that violators will be fined $25 if they are found driving a car on this day. this is a great way to promote a healthier world. doing this can lessen the ammounts of smog and pollution in the environment. "" its a good oppertunity to take away stress and lower air pollution'' said buisnessman carlos Arturo.

the number of greenhouse gases will continue too rise as the population does. this is due to the number of teens and adults getting their licences and cars. if this doesnt end soon the levels of greenhouse gas woll be extremely high.",0
"Car usage all over the world has reduced and been reducing slowly. Some of the advantages of limiting car usage may be the reducing of pollution or just to save money. Also due to many different reasons, even if it's for their own needs, or to just minimize the pollution going on in different parts of the world. In many places car usage has been being limited for countries all over. If it's China, Spain, Columbia, Paris, Germany, or even the United States of America. Not all countries have taken part in trying to reduce the use of cars to an all time low. That may just be their own choice. While other countries are sure trying to cut the usage of car for a variety of reasons. Some places in the world are doing it so they can cut some of the pollution done to the world. And if you think about it if half of the world tryed as hard as they possibly could to try and minimize pollution the world wouldnt be so pulloted. I know cars aren't the only things that cause pollution, but its a pretty big part of the daily life for any person no matter where they are.

In Vauban, Germany a suburban area has almost completely given up driving and even owning a car. ""Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park"" Rosenthal 2 but it cost a lot of money to even own a parking space. ""Carowners can buy a space, for 40,000, along with a home."" Rosenthal 2 That price may just be enough to keep people from owning a car all together. According to the article "" In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars "" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, 70 percent of vaughn's Families don't even own a car and 57 percent sold a car just to move there. Isn't that crazy? Imagine life without cars, it has advantages and disadvantages of course but advantages can lead to a positive outcome no matter what the reason is. By people in Vauban not owning cars they are most likely saving a lot of money because they don't have to buy the car, pay the ridiculous amount for a parking spot, and pay for the gas thats going to end up pollution the world anyway. Just a few of the many advantages in reducing or cutting out car usage completely.

Due to all the terrible and mass amounts of smog in Paris, France, they enforced a ""partial driving ban to clear the air or global city"" Duffer 10. For example, in this article called "" "" by Robert Duffer, on monday motorist with even numbered license plates were told to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22 euro fine which turns out to be 31 U.S. Dollars. And then the same thing would happen to those whose license plates ended in an odd number the following day. This had to have cut pollution a huge amount. If you think about how many people are living in Paris, and you think about them all staying off the road due to a ban then you may be able to understand the amount of pollution that wasn't produced during this ban. Now Paris, did this for the advantage purpose of reducing the amount of pollution they had in their air and by not adding more to it. It couldn't have a negative impact they were doing something good for the enviornment even if it didn't really help that much. Out of the whole city of Paris about ""4,000 drivers were fined,"" and ""27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine"" Duffer 12. Another advantage that Paris had due to them banning car usage was that ""Congestion was down 60 percent"" Duffer 14. The ruling French lifted the ban when the smog cleared up enough.

Bogota, Columbia turned what they did as a tradition, into a big hit to tons of poeple in other countries. "" Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota "" by Andrew Selsky informed the public about what was started a few years ago back in Columbia.

For a day cars except for buses and taxis were banned. In the city of ""7 million, the goal is to promote alternative transportation and also reduce smog. Violators faced 25 fines."" Selsky 21 Due the day without cars, the city of Bogotas has ""118 MILES of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American City."" Selsky 27 One advantage they had was that because of the day with out cars the parks and sports centers have been in the best shape they could possibly be in. They also did have to reduced the amount of pollution that was being put into the air, because it was such a big hit to other cities and countries.

Yet another article by Elisabeth Rosenthal called "" "", is stating the advantages in the United States and what has happened with the reducing of cars. ""Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" Rosenthal 29 The minimizing of cars in The U.S. has some advantages those being, ""Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions"" Rosenthal 29. New York City for example is home to the heart of public transportation due to all the taxis and the subway. Not many people in New York city drive or even own a car due to the congested streets, and the ridiculous amount of money you have to have just to park it like it was in Germany. Crazy amounts of money to park a car is just an outrage. The advantage here would be the money saved by not even owning a car and storing it. Another one would be the traffic is bad but not as bad as it would be if more people had cars. Public transportation is huge in New York. It's already expensive enough to live in New York imagine if there werent as many taxis and if the subway wasn't there at all. Picture all the pollution there would be.

To wrap up everything, as stated there are many advantages to reducing car usage all around the world. If it was to reduce smog or pollution of just to save money they are still advantages to decreasing the amount of times you use a car. If something is in walking distances why not just walk instead of taking a car and wasting money and also polluting the air unless it's a hybrid. The limiting of car usage is slowly but surely growing all over the world. Yes, cars are faster to get places, but why waste the money and clean air to be somewhere quickly? Think of all the advantages there are in reducing car usage not the disadvantages.",0
"The Electoral College is a process which occurs in the United States to help determine the president for the next four years of the entire nation. It is a very controversial topic and a plethora of people want to disregard the Electoral College. People want to vote for their president, but ultimately they are voting for the electors of the state who represent the president in the end. The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. It makes the voters feel like they have less power when they are voting and when people of a nation feel that way, they lose interest and lose the desire to vote for their country because they feel like their vote will not count or have and affect.

At the end of paragraph 10, two questions are asked, ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for?"" and ""Do voters get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate?"". The answers werenot always and sometimes. If a system or process confuses people enough where they vote for the wrong candidate they desired, then that system needs to go. That system is the Electoral College.

The single best argument against the electoral college is the disaster factor. With a name like that, you know this system cannot be good. Also, 3 high ranking officials and a couple of them that opposed the electoral college, were former presidents. They were Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole. The electoral confused system works like this. Voters vote for a slate of electors who in turn are the ones who elect the president. Is'nt the whole point of the election to vote for your candidate that you would like to win, and not his employees'? When a state votes for a president and has their majority vote, then the amount of electors in the state are what counts towards the voting polls. The state electors could be anyone not holding office at that time. Furthermore, electoral votes can possible end in a tie due to the fact that there is an even number of electors, 568, which is a big worry in the result of the election. Compared to electoral votes, there is only 55 representatives in California, but there is 35 million people in the state. A tie almost guaranteed, will not happen with that comparison.

A winner take all system is in play with the electoral college process. The system consists of when a president wins an election then all electors part or even somewhat representing that candidate are now with the president. Also bigger states have more representatives and the candidates focus more on those states to try and win them over. it leaves the smaller states like Wyoming and South Dakota, for example, to be left out of the equation and not be focused on too much in the process.

All in all, the elctorall college and process needs to be abolished and is not fair to the people of the nation voting and being taken advantage of.",0
"The author supports this idea by giving us multiple details about venus. Venus is a planet in our solar system and it is the second planet from our sun. It is proved that Venus is a challenging place to examine closely because it has a lot of stuff that humans can not experience. Venus is a challenging planet for human to study closely because there are stuff that are extremely dangerous for humans and that humans can not do such as: Venus is not always close to Earth, the temperature and atmosphere is greater than what we experienced in Earth and it's danger to get to Venus.

Venus moves a lot from us or we move a lot from venus. There are differences from Venus and us what I mean with that is that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus. In paragraph 2, the authors said humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. Each previous mission was unmanned, and that there is not a single spaceship that has survived the landing for more than a few hours and has touched down on Venus in more than three decades.

The temperature and atmosphere in Venus is greater than in Earth. Humans can not survived or experienced this because they would problably died. In paragraph three, it says that in venus is a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxiude and that the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than we experience in Earth. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. These things makes it more challenging for humans.

Trying to get to Venus is very dangerous for humans since we don't have resistents tools to go there and survived. In paragraph 5 , it says that the Nasa is working in possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus and they tought and allowed scientists to float above the fray. Like imagine a jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, it is still dangerous but it is survivable for humans.

In conclusion, Venus is a very challenging planet for humans to study because there are a lot of barriers that stop humans from getting more closer.",0
"My fellow citizens, allow me to make an urgent announcement. Stop with the constant use of cars. It's damaging not only us, but the environment. We live in aworld where cars are now becoming a major trend, and we're driving them more and more. If we keep drawing that pattern, we won't have a stable world to live in.

I'm not saying to completely stop using your vehicles, although we might see a larger change than expected, what I'm saying is to manage your car usage wisely. Every time we pick up the keys, start our engine and take off to the nearest grocery store, we add a larger threat to the environment. In 'Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog' by Robert Duffer, it informs of the enforcement France is taking to clean up it's polluted cities. Duffer shows us how ""the smog"" that invades the city became a rival to Beijing, China, which is known as the most polluted cities in the world. Imagine going outside to see the beautiful sun, and instead open the door to cars delivering blinding ""smog."" We can't allow ourselves to become the most polluted cities, and the first step is to manage ourselves with our cars.

There's some of us who suffer from stress and anxiety. There's some of us who look at our community and are probably never wanting to go outside again. That is not a community to live in. We deserve to feel relieved, relaxed, and renewed from time to time. In 'Car-Free Day Is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota' by Andrew Selsky, it demonstrates a perfect example. Selsky writes about a ""Car-Free"" day in Bogota, Columbia, and a man shares his side of this event. Carlos Arturo Plaza tells us, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air polluton."" Selsky writes in paragraph 28 the benefits of this event. He writes, ""Parks and sport centers bloomed... Dramatically cut traffic... New restaurants and shopping districts developed."" Look what we can accomplish from not using our cars as much.

We're in a time where money is the top priority in our lives. All those gas prices, and the car insurance car owners must pay is ridiculous. Sometimes people can't even sleep at night due to all the thinking of ""how will I pay this?"", or ""how will I pay that?"" It later becomes a constant battle. This is when technology comes in handy. Now with the common ""Facebook"" and other social media, we're able to connect more and more. It's sad to see people waste their money going to a friends house for probably an hour or so, when they can just talk virtually. Elisabeth Rosenthal, writer of 'The End of Car Culture,' most likely will agree with me. Rosenthal inputs Mimi Sheller's say in all this. Sheller is a sociology professor at Drexel University, and she cites important factors on paragraph 35. ""Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends."" Why drive and pay for gas when you can get on the web? You'll be glad you did.

Now, many will be able to disagree with me saying that, ""we need cars to drive long distances,"" or, ""I rather pay and have my own privacy then be with twenty people I don't know on a bus."" That's fine. I'm not saying to wipe out the fact that you have a car, all I'm saying is to use it wisely. Drive long distances, not short ones that can take you ten minutes to walk. ""What about the people who work in car companies?"" Well, if we all followed what Bogota is doing and develop shopping districts and renewal companies, I'm sure there will be many jobs available. No matter the pay, you'll still have no worry about your automobile bills, which will help you save a huge amount of money. We need to save ourselves from driving and polluting the earth, or else we won't have a great life to live. Blinding smog will cover the sky, and many won't be able to enjoy the rich outside there once was. All we will see are streets instead of parks. We need to stop ourselves from driving too much in order to live to the fullest.",0
"THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE

The Electoral College is somewhere they vote for President and Vice President and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. A majority of 270 electors votes is also required to elect the President. The 23rd Amendment of the Constitution is the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and they treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. After the presidential election, your governor prepares a ''Certicate of Ascertainment'' listing all the candidates who had ran for President in your state along with the names their respective electors.

The thing thats wrong with the electoral college is that the single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election in a century to the system that allows for much worse. Because each state casts only one vote to the single representatives from California to who the represent 35 million voters. The best arguments in favor mostly assertions without much basis  in the reality. But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote the party's nominee is possible that the winner of the electoral vote not win the national popular votes..",0
"First of all studying venus isn't a bad idea wanting to explore the deepest point of venus can change history and life, we can figure out many secrets that venus has and what kind of life form could be on venus because in every planet their's always something that hasn't been discovered. Venus is a planet that will soon be explored NASA has been sending spacecrafts to land on venus but they still don't make it,

For three decades many factors contribute to venus reputation and has been a challenge for humans to study, even thoe 97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets venus and clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus atmosphere and a temperature of 800 degrees fahrenheit and atmospheric pressure that is 90 times greater than what we expirence on earth those conditions are way to extreme that humans don't encounter that on earth

Another reason why it should be studied more and have future plans that someday people from NASA will land is that because many astronomers believe that venus may have once been the most earth-like planet in our solar system and that venus was onced probably covered largely with oceans and could've been many forms of life in venus many many years ago.

Many scientist are looking for a way to get samples of rocks,gas,or anthing else that they can use to find out more about venus but they cannot do that. many researchers are working on innovations that will allow machines to last longer so they can get enough samples for them.

Overall i think that finding new ways to explore and studie venus is a great idea i think that will change history maybe in the future venus can become our second home if we find out more about it and venus will soon be an explored planet and hope that will continue with other planets.",0
"Although you have made good points concerning the landform on Mars, I would like to respectfuly disagree on your opinion that aliens are responsible for the bulilding of Cydonia.

In the passage, ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"", the author has quotes comparing the face, Cydonia, to natrual landforms on earth such as moutains and messas. Through the passage and its comparrisons, we can infer that the ""face"" on Mars is, in face, just made up of natrual causes and the impact of the weather. If you really think and dig deeper, the picture of the face could resemble moutains or small hills posted, or positioned, relativly close together so that the image of a face is possible.

Lastly, the reason as to why Cydonia is in fact just a landform is the way that the author writes the passage. NASA very briefly mentions the possible outcome of aliens, but other than that nothing else has been said about the ""could be"" creatures. They must not be firm believers. Which leads me to the conclusion that is, if NASA had discovered aliens wouldn't that make them most popular? The discovery of new life would, without a doubt, be absolutly fantastic for NASA and its image. The thought that there might be life on Mars is a good enough situatiion to lie and say that you did find life only to have your buisness in the tabloids. We can all infer that is if NASA had discovered that Cydonia had been built by aliens American citizens would be the first to know. You cant hide something like this that would make your buisness so sucsessful.

In conclusion, we can infer that Cydonia is, in fact, a landform of some sort on the face of Mars. We know this through the discussion that landforms are built with natrual causes, not aliens, and that if the face were to be built by aliens it wouldn't be hidden from citizens knowing that the discovery could boom multiple buisnesses.",0
"About twenty five years ago, the Face was first discovered by Viking 2 while it was circling Mars taking pictures. NASA got the pictures and released them days after the mysterious rock was found. The Face settles in the region of Cydonia on Mars.

People think that the Face is created by aliens because the rock formation looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh; however, it is not. Arguements about the Face have been going on since the first picture was released. I'm here to tell you that the Face is 100% a natural landform.

When people argue about the miraculous rock formation, they say that there was or is life on Mars and that the aliens built the Face because it appears to have a mouth, nose, and eyes.

Some questions we get a lot are ""How did it get there?"", ""Why does it have a human face?"", and ""How did it naturally get prominent face features of a human?"" We do not 100% know how the Face got its human feature, but through all of the tests we have done on Mars, there are no aliens found and that the Face is just a fantasic natural made wonder of space.

When I get more informtion about the Face, I will certainally let you know!",0
"""Whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions (Nick D'Alto)."" Having the technology to read student emotions in class is not valuable because it would cost a fortune and it would be a distraction.

The software to detect the emotions of students would be too expensive and that makes the Facial Action Coding System not valuable. ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile (Nick D'Alto)."" Most schools have standard home computers in class, which means the school will spend a fortune to replace the old computers with new and more powerful computers. After replacing the computers schools will still have to buy the Facial Action Coding System, which will most like cost alot of money that could be used for other things.

Another reason the Facial Action Coding System is not valuable is because it would be a distraction in a classroom. ""Empathy (feeling someone else's emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions (Nick D'Alto)."" After being told one student's emotion the other students in that class will unconsciously feel that emotion and distracting them for their lesson.

The Facial Action Coding System is not valuable in schools because it is a distraction and it would cost a fortune to install. There is no need for a computer to tell a student's emotion in class.",0
"Would it be safe to travle to Venus or what about to colect some samples of Venus like rocks,gasses or other things in Venus? Have people wounder how is Venus and is it simliller or different to Earth? We know that Venus is a planet and that Venus is closest to Earth but some poeple might not know how danger Venus has. Has any people or a ship landed on Venus or expernece how Venus feels or looks like on ground. Is it is real worth going to Venus and expercence there conditions or find any life forms in Venus?

Venus Is a similler planet like Earth but only its density and size of the planet. Venus Is a Extreme planet, the conditions on Venus are bad, in Venus almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets Venus. The clouds in Venus are different, there clouds of highly corrosive sulfuir acid is in the atmosphere. On Venus the surface temperatuer avage is 800 degrees Fahreanheit acording to the artical. Those are some extreme temperatuers for a human and for a space craft to be stay in Venus. In Venus the pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience in Earth, humans or machines can not with stand the heat or pressure of the atmosphere.

Humands cant live in these types of conditions like Venus has a person can end up dead and a machien or a ship can melt. No even a space ship or human landed on Venus in these types of conditions. Samples have not even been taken like rocks or gases because of these conditions in Venus. These types of misions can be super risky to do becasue of they extreme conditions the planet has. Earth and Venus are different, Earth has less extreme conditions than Venus dose but later on NASA is trying to find ways to see how they can have protection on there spacce ships and people to try to get some samples from Venus.

This is why and how dangerous Venus can be and how there condtions are extreme. Peopel would not risk dying to get some samples from Venus or try to go to

Venus. This why its not worth to study and analize samples of Venus and later on they can try to find better material or things to help out the space ship and humans to try to land or analize any samples from Venus.",0
"Imagine getting off work on a Friday at five o'clock, there's no bumper to bumper traffic, no horns honking at each other, and no stressful commutes home. This is unimaginable for people who reside in the U.S., but people in parts of Europe live like that every day. There are many advantages to cutting down on car usage.

One advantage to this cut would be that you would be saving money. Many people who drive tend to get in accidents or get pulled over by police for speeding. These incidents are very costly and come with repercussions if you don't pay them. Another way you would be saving money is not having to pay for gas. Gas may be only $2.00 for now, but when those prices go on that incline again it becomes very costly to fill up the tank. If you can't afford to fill up your tank then you will be putting wear and tear on the car which leads to more more money being spent to maintnance it. Alternate transportation that's more cost efficient is taking the city bus. It costs about $1 to get from point A to point B where it would cost you about $6 in gas to get you to the same place. You could also purchase a bicycle to take you where you need to go. Maintnancing a bike is a lot cheaper than a car.

A second advantage that limiting car usage has is that it eliminates pollution. A car gives off sound, light, and air pollution which all effect our ecosystem whether you notice it or not. The U.S may not have as much air pollution as other countries but with the increase in car purchases it could get worse. I'm not saying youn have to completely get rid of your vehicles, but maybe the license plate bill may work. Every other day only license plates that begin or end with odd numbers could drive, and on the days the odds can't drive we allow the plates with the even numbers to drive. People could car pool with co-workers on the days that whoever has those plates can drive. We just need to start taking percausions on our car usage.

In the car free test cities people are overall happier because they aren't so stressed worrying about being late due to traffic or getting in an accident. Driving can be extremely stressful especially with the many things that can distract people so easily. These distractions can lead to accidents or just more stress. "" 'When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way' said Heidrun Walter, mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children driwn out the distant motor.""(Source 1, Paragraph 3, Lines 4-11) This quote puts an image in my mind that is happy and stress free. Imagine how happy you would be if everything was conviently close to youer home and you could enjoy walks or biek rides places with your kids.

People should take a moment and think about ehat life without depending on cars would be like. Would you be healthier, happier, or not? Just take into consideration how you would live and be if we didn't have to rely on cars.",0
"The electoral college is a bad thing because voters aren't voting directly for the candidates. Voters are only voting for a slate of electors that then vote for a president. Uninformed people might be mislead as to what they are actually voting for. The election should be changed to popular vote because the electoral college is not voting directly on a matter.

While big states have more say in what happens, small states were created to have just as much power. There are few states with over twenty electoral votes, and twenty votes is a lot. But, there are far more small statesin terms of population than big states. Having many states with only 716 beats few big states with 2055. Some candidates won the popular vote, but lost the electoral vote due to what states they were popular in. This sways the actual results of voting and messes up what should be based on raw voting numbers. Having electors making the desision for the state is another reason why certain candidates lose.

Some people in America don't know the difference between the popular vote and electoral vote. This can result in people being mislead. If a candidate were to visit California and make a good impression, that state would have a higher chance of being in that candidates favor. If another candidate were to go to Montana, make a good impression just like the first one, he would have the advantage for that state. Both candidates put in the same effort, but the first one would have many more electoral votes than the second mainly because of how electoral votes work.

The winner takes all rule is also in some way bad. Candidates would be competing over larger states like California and New York, If the voting within that state came down to a 49 to 51 percent vote, one candidate would be so close but acheive absoloutly nothing. Each candidate SHOULD get whatever votes they earned to make the voting the way it should be and more fair.

The electoral college is in many ways imperfect, which is why popular vote would be more efficient and more of an actual competition. Popular vote is also a way to make voting simple.",0
"dear state senator, As you know America is very different from other countries. We are known as the land of the free, but then why cant we the people choose our president? The electoral college takes that right away from us. Americans have the right to vote so why would we be ignored and have our vote discarded. Many people dont agree with the electoral college system becase it strips people of their say and opinion in politics theres also the possibility of what people call a diastor factor. Despite it not being the best way to choose a president there are some pros to using the electoral college system, for instance runoff elections, where the amount of popular votes are too close or when ""no candidate recieves a majority of votes cast"" sited from source 3 but then again thats very rare.

The electoral college has someone voting in our places. A state representative cant say yes to all the candidates so why are they choosing for us we know who we want in office we as americans have a voice and a say in who is our leader. The amount of votes depends on how many people live in each state but ""because each state casts only one vote,the single representative from wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, woud have as much say as the 55 representatives from california who represent 35 million voters"" as sited from source 2 with all representatives choosing the same candidate how can you expect them to reflect the will of the people?

disaster factors are the best argument againt the electoral college ""back in 1960 segragationists in the louisiana legislator nearly succeeded in replacing the democratic electors with new electors who would oppose john f kennedy so that a popular vote for kennedy would not have actually gone to kennedy "" thers also the fact that ""in the same vein and faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for whomever they please""as both sited from source 2 these disaster factors just prove how the electoral college can fail to choose a candidate fairly.

To summarize i would like to restate that the electoral college takes away americans freedom of choice,it also does not allow people to choose who they think would help benefit our country,and the chance of disaster factors it could brings into play.",0
"Is limiting car usage a benefitial way to reduce many uneccessary smog and pollution in any part of the world? This is a case of many opinions. Many people say it is beneficial to the environment and where they live in. Others disagree about limiting car usage due to slow mobility going from place to place that might be far away. In my opinion, i do support the idea that limiting car usage is a helpful way to reduce smog and many other pollutants that might spread in the natural world. For example, reducing smog from the air helps animals and humans to breath better air and reduces the risk factor of getting a decease from the pollution or smog. Also, it just not only cleans the air but it helps citizens live a helathier life by always staying physically active either going from place to place.

It is a great way to reduce smog or pollution by limitng car usage and helps stop cars and truscks to stop generating many malitiant gases that may cause deceases. According to Source #3, its states that ""Millions of columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day."" This is a great example and idea of living in an environment that has reduced the amount of pollution generated by cars and trucks. Not using cars can also help the animals in the environment they live in. Animals also have a roll

Penultimately, the limiting of car usage also helps citizens live a healthier life by staying physically active and helps them stay in shape. Doing exercise everyday can also help reduce the risk factor of getting inmobile. Transportation like walking and jogging to places and not using mechanical transportation is the best way due to the fact that we dont produce pollution or smog.

Finally, limiting the car usage  can help reduce pollution and smog for many reasons. It can help the environment we live in and helps citizens stay physically active and healthy. It also helps animals live better due to the air they breathe. We need to take part on cleaning the place we live in and so if we caused smog and pollution into the air, Why not make a change and reduce what we already created?",0
"Kids across America probably know someone who looks or acts like they are depressed, but when they ask what is wrong they usually say they are fine or nothing is wrong and they will try to continue their day. Having a Facial Action Coding System inside of schools would benefit many schools and people. If schools had this and staff heard about a kid who is not looking mentally well they can have the kid go through the system and if anything is wrong they could give the kid the help he or she needs.

The child will not be able to slide past the system with a fake smile either because in paragraph 7 the FACS can detect the difference between a forced smile and a genuine smile making it harder for you to slip passed the system. The FACS does not always have to be used to see if a child feels bad and needs help. In paragraph 6 Dr. Haung says that if a child was on a computer the computer could recognize if the student was confused or bored. This could benefit kids greatly because sometimes kids are afraid to ask questions in front of the class, but if this was set up to where the teachers were alerted when a kid was confused the teacher could just walk over to the child and ask what they were confused about and asses the problem right where the kid is sitting.

In conclusion having the FACS in schools would benefit kids and teachers greatly because they could see how their students are feeling and if they are confused in anyway, and they could see what the problem is and how they could fix it whenever they need to.",0
"Aliens are real, Frank I'm telling you. The aliens made that face on Mars. Why do you think that, Grayson? No one can step on Mars. If a person steps on Mars, they will die. No one has ever been to Mars, Still to this day. Are you sure about what you are saying? I'm sure about this. Aliens live in the galaxy. They can step on any planet whenever they want to and not die.

Well I have something to say. Aliens do not exist. If they were real, they would have took over the world. They would have been making us do work every single day. f they came here they would probaly have killed us by now. Have they killed us, have they started making us do work? No, they haven't.

Grayson? Yes, Sir? I heard you and Kevin talking about how aliens made that face on mars. Both of you are wrong. You were right about the no aliens part, but everything else was wrong. We just now figured out that it was just another Martian mesa. It is common enough in Cydonia. When we took the picture, I have got a lot of e-mails saying ""what is that thing?"" I even got a e-mail from Michael Bay saying that he is going to use that image for a movie. This stuff is crazy!

Thats awesome sir! Wait, Grayson there is more. The picture is accually the Martian of a butte or mesa. It's common across the American west. I hope we can find more stuff like that. Me too that was a wierd experience.",0
"The Elector College ishould be aboliished becauise of it'is many flawis that it hais.

In addition to that, if the people vote for the candidate'is electoris, how do the people know that the electoris are voting for the running candidate they won? Well they isimply don't. Stated in Source 2 under ""What'is wrong with the electoral college"" it talkis about how electoris vote for whom which ever candidate they want.

"Why would people use this type of technology to read students emotions and why is it valuable. I'll tell you why it's valuable. I'll also tell you if it's wrong to do this. I'll tell you if it's right to do this.

I think this type of technology is great to read students facial expressions. Because if a student is feeling sad and the school didn't know the school can help that kid if there is something wrong. They could figure out weather that kid is always bored in a certain class so maybe the teacher can make the class funner. They can use this technology to see if a kid is angry in a certain class and that the school can ask why the student gets so angry in that class like is he getting bullied or he just hates the class. Im all for this technology i think it's really cool.

But there are also the negatives to this technology. Lets say a student dosent want anyone to watch him when he's trying to do work or when he's at home doing stuff. Students don't want their privacy invaded. If students don't want people to know what feelings they are going thorugh then maybe they should'nt do this.

That is my opinion on this new technology. I don't know if it's wrong to do this or if it's the right thing to do. I think they should take a vote if students want this or not.",0
"Well i think we choose our own character traits,because its up to you what you want to do, we choose if we want to be happy,sad,or angry. I've learned that with my mom,she always tells me,""you choose to be happy,sad,angry""

Sometimes our character is formed by influences beyond our control,and that's okay everyone has diffrent reasons to be mad or to be sad,happy but we can change it if we want to. The British naturalism and politician John Lunnock was right about what he wrote,this helps a lot of people to understand that if someone do,did,say,or have said something to you ,it'll be our choice to get mad,sad,or just ignore what happened..

After that your character it'll be what you choose to make it.

For example,i've been trought a lot this past years ,my chilhood was not the best i did not had a father or my mom when i was a little girl,i grew up with my grandparents my uncle raped me when i was seven years old,my other unclu he used to hit me all the time in my head,my grandma used to hit me with the belt , i was fat when i was a little girl,and people used to make fun of me,

That really affect me ,because i'm unsecure about my body,or how i look,i've in Hospitals because i try to kill myself last year,because i was depressed,because all the things that i've been trought and now i choose to be happy,im going to therapits on Monday's,i started working ,i play soccer,or i go out with my sister.

I have choose to be happy .

Sometimes it's hard to be happy,even that you know you want to be happy you just don't see one reason to be,and it's sad because you know your family it's feeling the same pain you feel inside of you ,the only thing you think in those moments are, ""why would i do this"" or ""why am i trying so hard "" .

Those are the worst feelings,when you want to get up in the morning but you can't.

In conclusion,my opinion it's that everyone needs to know that ,our character will be what we choose to make ,we have to make good decisions to be good.",0
"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author says that Venus is important to study. However, the author mostly talks of how we could explore Venus rather than tell us why its important to, but never addresses why its important.

In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author mainly talks of how we would be able to explore Venus but, never really explains why it's more important than another planet that we can actually explore such as mars. On Venus the atmosphere is mainly made up of carbon dioxide a compund that is highly poisonious to humans. Without oxygen present the explorers would have to carry oxygen tanks around that only last for a short amount of time. This means we would have to use rovers to explore the surface until we find a way to be able have more oxygen to be able to explore longer. Another problem that rises to the occasion is the unbearable heat, storms, and natural disastors happening constantly on Venus. With all these problems a rover wouldn't be able to last more than a few hours. Meaning this ""important study"" is not only a waste of valuable time but money that can be used on projects that would be more completable such as putting a person or group on mars.

The author states that despite all the dangers present it's still a worthy presuit. Lets say in 20 years we found a way around all of that and landed a rover on Venus that was capable of lasting a month. The rover goes around takes samples of rocks but sees nothing that was really astonashing, now imagine those rock samples match some of those on earth. Thats great we found a link to the past, but thats nothing to go crazy over we still have other problems such as putting humans on there that are able to bear the uninhabitale conditons and bringing machines and technology over to do more studies that will show why it was important to get to Venus.

Overall, the author doesn't explain why it's important they just state it. All the problems brought up were unable to be addressed and it just sounds like a bigger waste of time and money as the author goes on, because we do not know whats out there. There could be noting and there could be something we just dont know. The author doesn't state any evidence as of why its important therefore the author doesn't support there idea.",0
"Car usage around the world is causing an increase in pollution, greenhouse gas, and obesity. Cities have had to shut down roads and ban driving just to clear the pollution in the air due to car usage.

This is why the world must put limitations on car usage. If we limit the usage of cars we will be rewarded with numerous benefits, such as: better health, clean cities, and new relationships, in turn.

""But cars take us everywhere we need to go and fast! Why should we not use them?!"" Many people exclaim when first hearing about this idea. While getting to your destination fast, you begin to speed up everything around you. Trying to get everything over with as fast as possible. For example, a teenager is driving home, he notices he has 5 extra minutes because he was speeding, and he feels hungry. So what will he do? He will go drive through a McDonalds and get his dinner. Now, not only has he added to greenhouse gas and the pollution of his city, he is also polluting his body. Another downfall of the use of cars is safety. Millions of car accidents happen every single year killing thousands of people. Cars give stupid people too much power and speed then they need. You would not experience a bike crash or public transit bus crash as often as you would a car crash. Cars don`t just affect personal safety, they endanger your city. Driving hundreds of cars around one area will definitely lead to the collection of fuel emissions ehich in turn produces smog. Paris, France had to put a restriction on car usage because of the fact that the city`s air was covered in smog. Who on earth wants to live in a city of smog. The restriction acted as a test, to see if they could omit fuel emissions and help reduce the smog. So, one day all the even licensed plates were banned from driving while, the next day all the odds were banned from driving. This plan worked so well it didn`t last more than a couple of days. Car usage is a big issue worldwide and it needs to be stopped.

""Wouldn`t the limitation of car usage be a waste of cars?"" No. the answer is plain and simple no. Countries worldwide are taking action to wean people off of using personal cars. In Bogota Colombia, they have the Day Without Cars, a holiday in which you can not, at any time , use your automobile. The city of 7 million all use bicycles, and other forms of non technological transportation to move around the city. People who do not participate will be subject to paying money.

This day has caused new bike paths to be built, parks, sport centers to grow more popular, and decreases the air pollution of Colombia. Another country taking part in the no car festivities is Germany. In Vauban you will experience a ""car free"" community. This town has stores built within walking distance, and offers public transport to travel around the town. ""I`m much happier this way"" said a german mother of 2. She walks the town and speaks of the noises she hears such as the ""swish of bicycles"" and ""chatter of children"". The limitation of the cars has brightened the communtiy as a whole and allowed for it`s residents to be more happy and healthy as they walk or bike most places. Also, studies show that happiness and good health are directly related so while fixing the negative effects of car use you are also stopping the vicious cycle of obesity .

Over all, the world would be a much better place without a high usage of cars. These new ideas and innovations are testing the ideals of a car free society and frankly, they are getting positive results.  Without cars, the world would be a much cleaner, healthier and happier place for all.",0
"Today, it is not often we see somone walking or taking the bus as transportation.  Cars are the more preferred option of getting from point A to point B in a quick an easy way.  It is hard to even think about a world where car usage is limited, but there are many advantages of it and several efforts being made to accomplish this.

To begin, there has been a slow decrease of miles driven, driving by young people, and people obtaining a driver's license in the United States. President Obama has made it a goal to curb the country's greenhouse gas emissions, but how is this to be accomplished?  As studies show, America might have already had its peak in driving.  People are finding alternatives to the car such as public transportation, walking, bicycling, or carpooling.  As for limiting the pollution, many sociologists believe if this decrease persists, it will benefit carbon emissions and the environment.  Mimi Sheller, a sociology progessor at Drrexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center, said: ""different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift.""  Car companies have even began to worry and proposing ideas if this is to be accomplished and personal vehicle ownership is unnecessary.  ""Pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety,"" said Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company.  He proposed partnering with telecommunications industry to create cities where this ideal would be a reality.

Moreover, there are several other reasons why limiting car usage is advantageous.

Recently in Paris, there has been near-record pollution and in response, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air.  Congestion was down 60 percent but delivery companies complained of lost revenue.  If Paris did happen to continue this ban, pollution would have decreased even more.  Also, in Bogota, Columbia, there is a day each year dedicated to fray from car use with only buses and taxis permitted to drive.  People hiked, biked, skated, or took public transportation which was the cause of the absense of traffic jams.  The goal of this day is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog.  ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza.  Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay said, ""these people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders.""  This will hopefully spread into other countries, occur on more occasions throughout the year, and lead the way to ridding the world of pollution.

Furthermore, a suburb in Germany has taken a more extreme approach to the car-free situation.  70 percent of the residents of Vauban, Germany have given up there cars.  This is a growing trend in Europe and the United States and has become a movement known as ""smart planning.""  larger cities full of families are to blame for the impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emmisions from tailpipes, says experts.  ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.""  This experiment is very advanced and proves that living without cars is possible and has many advantages.  ""When I had a car I was always tense.  I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, resident of Vauban.  Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America.

To conclude, I believe there are many advantages of limiting car usage.  Pollution would decrease and traffic jams would stop.  Although many efforts are being made such as the ban in Paris and Car-Free day in Bogota, Columbia, people seem to be leaning more towards other means of transportation other than the car.  Both of these as well as the growing cities that forbid cars I think will lead the way into a world where personal vehicles are impractical and unwanted and pollution from cars is a thing in the past.",0
"Their are so many advantages of limiting car usage, for example having no car might even make someone happy, Heidrun Walter says ""When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Also driving cars can cause a lot of pollution, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of the green house gas emissions in Europe. France had intense smog because of vehicles, it went 60 percent down after five days of no vehicle use.

Another benefit of no vehicle usage is instead of driving a car, you can go hiking, biking, skating , or take buses to your destination. ""It's a good way to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two seat bicycle with his wife. The day without cars has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, which is the most of any other Latin American city. Parks and sports centers bloomed throughout the city on the day without cars in Bogota.

Also, in the United States Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses. Instead of driving vehicles to work, one can carpool with a workmate. New York has a new bike sharing program anits skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect new priorities, swell as carsharing programs across the nation. Driving by young people decreased 23 percent as of 2001 to 2009.

Even though driving a car might get you to your destination quicker, it is better to go on a train, bike, skate, bus, taxi, carpool, or even walk because when you use a car too much you pollute the Earth. Biking, skating, and walking can also be fun sometimes, so stop driving a car and do something more alternative and less air pollution, save the Earth.",0
"I have just read ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" and many people are convinced that the Face, found near Cydonia, is just a natural landform. However, there are also many people who believe this Face to be of extra-terresrial activity. However, NASA has gave us more facts that prove the Face to be a mountain-like landform rather than an extra-terrestrial phenomenon.

First of all, many photos taken by NASA themselves show no evidence of aliens, but natural landmasses. On April 5, 1998, NASA sent the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) over Cydonia. MIchael Malin and his team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Once that happened, it was revealed to the public that the Face was just a landform. This proves that the mass was indeed a landmass. Also, these pictures were taken after the original one(the one that got everyone speculatng about the origin of the landmass), which means that the new pictures are much clearer and thus more believable han the original.

Secondly, many of the theories around the Face of Mars being a definite sign of aliens, are all conspiracy theories. The fifth paragraph states,"" Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" This quote from the article proves that there are many people who make up theories that have no credibility or legs to stand on. Also, many of these claims hold no cocrete evidence but are rather based on speculation.

Finally, NASA deployed the MGS yet again on April 8, 2001- a cloudless day in Cydonia. Paragraph ten explains,"" We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maxium resolution."" Also, paragraph twelve states,"" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa-landforms common around the American West."" These quotes prove that the picture was the best resolution it be, and the Face was still depicted as a landmass. Also, they compare these landforms to landforms commonly found in the American West. This concludes that the Face is not of any extra-terrestrial activity, but just a misunderstanding made by conspiracy theorist.

In conclusion, based on the evidence from the article, the Face is in fact a landform of Mars. This states that there is no extra-terrestial life in our universe( as of right now). This article teaches people that you should not listen to conspiracy theories, but facts that have evidence to support it.",0
"To the senator of the state of Florida you have asked us to write a letter explaining why we believe in keeping the Electoral College and the answer to that is no we should not how many votes have gone to waste because of this unfair system? and wasn't the United States a democratic country? we as citizens deserve to atleast pick who runs our country, By having this system you are not giving us the right to vote if you think about it, like Bob Dole once said ""Abolish the Electoral College!"".

I believe, that this way of running presidential elections should be thought about more. You do realize people stand HOURS not a couple minutes or 20 minutes hours waiting and thinking that they are going to actually pick the president they believe this country needs when in reality you are actually picking electors that may or may not help you elect the president that you picked. ""What is the Electoral College"" By the Office of the Federal Register explains in detail much more about the electoral college and like he said ""You help choose your state's electors when you vote for president because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."" We as citizen should have the right to pick our leader the one that will help us overcome our problems not some candidates.

For instance, Let's take the 2000 Gallup poll also called the ""Biggest election crisis in a century"" by  Bradford Plumer in his story ""The indenfensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defense of the system are wrong"" Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency all together and we found that out thanks to the quirks of the electoral college. Do you imagine how many presidents that must have happened to? it is like when you are first place in a race your close to the finish line, you can feel your legs givng up on you but you don't stop you keep going because you know your gonna win after all you are the first one, you're so close your about to step on the line when boom! the person that was behind you caught up and well.. you lost. Can you imagine how many votes have just gone to waste and how many hours in peoples days.

However, Some of our best presidents have gotten picked by the Electoral College there is no doubt in that. But it still does not change the fact that its an unfair system, the story by Richard A. Posner ""In defense of the electoral college:Five reasons to keep our despised the method of choosing the President"" explains that ""As we saw in 2012 elections.. Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign-- to really listen to the competing candidates--knowing that they are going to decide the election."" What he is saying is thta basically some states do not even have billboards! how are we suppose to feel like citizens when you don't give us atleast a poster to know who is running for president? The big states get the most candidates ofcourse so basically, one states could decide who wins. The system has UNFAIR written all over it and we are all just waiting for you to see it.

In the end, It is the congress decision, But we do hope you look at these letters and realize how this is taking our rights away, how many votes have not even counted, and how selfish the whole system is. I do hope you take in my letter into consideration and decide the best decision for us. But please do remember that Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, The U.S Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO said "" Abolish the Electoral College!"".",0
"My position about technology is this brings many effect positive for us huminity life. I take this opinion for the chaning on our life and the support positive in the knowledge.

First reason, for saying the the tecnology have good effects on the human's life is it helps to do many activity fast and easy. For example, many years ago we had to go the store and we watched the stuffed we need. now with the new technology, we do not need to move. we can bay only.

Second reason, tecnology gives support to the knowledge with the creation of new tools and more precision.

For example, before we used the telescopes for treated to understand the universo, now the technology us helps with the creation of new satellite .

Thrid reason, that support the tnechnology have good effects in our economy. For example on market every people want to down the price of production, the new technology helps on this.

In conclution, technology shows to good change on human's life,

in the economy, in the konwlege and many areas technology helps.",0

Dear Generic_Name

I write to teacher Generic_Name today with the benefit of work in group. The work in group is more better then work alone, in the beneficial is the student work in group is have more opportunity of learn more with other students in the class, they can work more better and understand more quickly the theme in the class and have more collaboration, learn to respect other students. They in the group can say new ideas for the team.

I think in the personal the work in group is more productivity in the student because have a good communication with the students and teacher, they have more positive attitude in the ideas and participation.

For example, students in the group work more and learn more quickly because in group have a higher quality of ideas, and students can change ideas together about the theme in the class and have a better determination in the job of the class.

Second, work in group have a big benefit in the class because students understand problems more quickly, and they have solution in theme complicated with ideas and dedication in class.

Third, students have collaboration with other students have a good relation and learn to respect others person for religion or ideas. They have more communication in the class and have more better grade in the school.

However, work alone not have good result because almost all the student have fear to say ideas for the critic of other students in the class, and they have slow work in the class for complication of the theme.

The preference is work with a group have more benefit in the student and teacher to learn and teach other students in the school have more communication, better work and good relation in the school.

sincerely

"There are a lot of poeple these days that having a bad attiude during a difficult time. Here are some ways to try to have a good attiude during these times.

Getting a bad grade on a test or quiz. Their are kids in middle and high school who study and at times get bad grades. These kids have trouble knowing that they failed their test or quiz. One way to provent this from happen is by having a good mindset. They can deepdown be mad, but if they put tell themselfs that ""i'll try harder next time"" they could do better on the retake or on the next quiz or test. Even when some kids that study a lot and fail some of they overreact during it.

Overreacting is another promble kids have. Some kids overreact by saying ""if i fail this i wont get a job"". Other times kids thing negativly about themselfs and they bring themselfs down. They could be telling theemselfs "" i'm going to fail"" or anything else instand of that they sould try telling them say ""i'm going to try to do my best. They dont know intill they try to do their best.

Having a good mindset can help. Havin a good mindset meaning to think positivly and to know that not having passed their test or anyting in life. That everyone had to start from one place and build on. Other times kids should learn from their mistakes. They might have or might have not fail and they shouldn't put it on themselfs because they could fail if not.

These are ways to provent kids from having a bad attitude to having a good attitude during their difficult time. They should try to be more calm and the should try to not overreact at much. They should also try to have a good mindset during it.",0
"Did you know that when people are giving you advise someone else told that person the same thing! This is why some people probably don't have advise for you when you ask for some. But when people ask for advise they will most likely ask their family members, people who inspire them, and their current or old teachers.

When a person is going to ask for advise the first people they will probably ask is their family members. The first people in the family that would most likely ask is their parents. The reason for this is because they have been living with them most or their life or even their whole life. The next people in their family that they would ask would probably be their grandparents. Everyone I feel like thinks their grandparents are old and wise and know every thing but they I got admit they do have some good advise. The last person in the family someone would ask would be their brothers or sisters. You have been living with them most if not part of your life, and you wanted to move you could ask them for places they have been to that they liked or the best moving company. People ask what if you don't have any family members to look up to well who is been your inspiration in life.

Other people that you can ask or look up to for good advise is the people who inspire you. Say you don't a person who inspires you. Well you always have your parents or other family members. Most of time people who inspire you, you can most likely never see once in your life in person, so what do you do. You can go on the internet and search famous quotes that they said, or you can watch some television shows or YouTube videos of them talking inspirational. A person who can even inspire you could even be your friends. You have been with your friends your whole life so you always ask for good advise because they care for you. Well what if you don't want to ask someone who inspires you, well almost everyone went to school growing up so you always have your teachers.

While growing up almost everyone went to school and while you their everyone had teachers to teach you life skills. Most teachers you have had posters all over the walls with good quotes or great advise. You can always look at these posters and use them in your everyday life. A teachers job is to teach you life skills that you can use as a adult. So when a teacher give you advise you always use that advise any day of your life. Even after school is over you can still go back and ask them. The reason being is that they care for you, even if you were a bad student they will still help you. In the long run if you need help from a teacher you can always just stay after school and ask, go back if you have already left the school, or even look at those inspirational posters.

In conclusion their are lot of different people that you could get advise from. You can get advise from your family, people who inspire you, and your old or current teachers. Next time if I'm looking for good advise I would defiantly see one of these people.",0
"Studying Venus is worthy this shows in many way. Venus is known was the 'Evening Star"" and that's why we get light in the night sky. Venus is the second planet from the sun. Itis very challenging place to examine the earth more closely. Even tho Venus is a very challenging planet for humans to study they are proximity to us.

Venus has a wonderful value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet by itself, but also because the human curiosity will lead us tho more equal intimidating endeavors. They have meet very edges of imagination and innovation. The NASA are workig on other new ways to study Venus and to find more information about Venus. They have found out more about through out the time Venus has the hottest surfce temperature of any planet in this solar system. Astronomers are amazed by Venus because it is may well known.

Venus can be our nearest option for a planetary visit. We should all be very thankful for the people who study the planets. There are many more facts about Venus that humans know because of the people who study planets and Venus is the most important one. The Challenge of Exploring Veunus is worth the study that humans do.",0
"Have you ever struggled and needed help? What did you do to fix your problem? Asking your friends is a good option but a lot of times it's not good enough to just ask one person. When seeking out for advice, it is beneficial to talk to more than one person because it eliminates or decreases bias, you get multiple opinions from different perspectives, and you can find the most effective option to fit your own needs.

Many people have their own ways to solve certain problems and therefore have their own opinions on how to solve the task at hand. When you ask more than one person for advice, you can see what has worked for certain people and apply the different strategies to your own problem. Everyone needs some advice including players in the National Hockey League or in any other professional sport. Athletes always get advice from many coaches and each coach has their own style. Athletes then use the advice to see what is most beneficial. Asking for more than one person for advice won't guarantee that your problem will be solved, but the probability of success if substantially higher because you have other people's experiences to get you closer to your solution.

On my hockey team I am currently assistant captain and sometime my teammates come to me for help. For example, one of my teammates asks me what he needs to do when he below the goal line. I always give him my opinion, but i always suggest that he also asks for another opinion. Because we are not the same, my strategies won't necessarily work for him. When we start playing our games, he can try out the different strategies and see what is most effective. Now he is able to adjust and use the most effective solution to get his way out of the problem

Lastly, Asking multiple people is great because you can find the most effective option. I applied to three private schools and you had to write an essay for all three schools. When I was down at Texas, I was proof-reading one of my essays and was getting ready to turn it in. My mom and I were already proofreading but we chose to get multiple opinions on my essay. We ended up getting my aunt and my older cousin to help produce the best final copy of my essay. We were all collaborating and talking to make sure we all agreed on the errors and the best way to fix each problem. Even though I had my own ways of fixing it, it was not the most clear and concise way. The final product ended up very good and I ended up getting in to all three of the schools. This showed that getting multiple opinions on a certain task can lead to the best product or solution.

Getting multiple opinions is helpful because it eliminates or decreases bias leading to a overall better product or solution. Even professionals such as book authors need people to constantly check over their work and to give them feed back on their stories. Everyone needs help here or there along their lives, but all you have to do is ask. Getting multiple opinions will help eliminate or decrease bias, you get multiple opinions from different perspectives, and you can find the best most effective option.",0
"If you have ever been in a tough situation you would know getting help is one of the hardest things to do. Many people are scared or afraid to ask for help because they feel that they might be judged or picked on by others. Sometimes people ask for multiple opinions on their problem. The reason why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is because it helps you get the best possible answer, it gives you different points of view on the matter, and lastly there are people with more knowledge on the situation than others.

By asking for multiple opinions on a matter it can benefit you because it helps you make the best possible choice you can. The way I believe it benefits you to ask for multiple opinions is for example, if you are asking someone the best way to become better at football, the first person you ask might say go to the weight room three times a week, then the second person you ask might say to eat more healthy food and be a consistent runner, and lastly the third person says to go out on the football field and practice your throwing and catching two times a week. So with all the information you just received you can use it and make the best possible solution by working out three times a week, working on your throwing and catching two times a week and eating healthy and being a consistent runner.

The second way that I believe asking for multiple opinions can help you make the better choice is because you get different points of view on the matter. For example if you ask your friend ""whats the best way to study for a test,"" your first friend may say to study before the test to get all the information in your head right before your about to take it, your second friend may say that he doesnt know the best way to study for a test, your third friend may say to pay attention in class and do every single homework. The way this benefits you is because now that you got three different opinions on your matter you can pick which one that you would like to do.

The third and final way that I believe asking for multiple opinions can help you best make the better choice is because people have more knowledge on different situations than others. For example if you ask your friend whats the best barbershop to go to in Virginia your first friend might have no clue but your second friend that you ask might give you a location to go to because he has more knowledge on the topic then your first friend. Different people have different knowledge on different topics so that way your friends might not always know the solution to your question but others may.

In conclusion if you ask for multiple opinions then you should have the best possible solution for your problem. There are many reasons to ask for multiple opinions when you need help. The reason why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is because it helps you get the best possible answer, it gives you different points of view on the matter, and lastly there are people with more knowledge on the situation than others.",0
"Studying Venus would be a worhty pursuit despite the dangers because it would provide great information and it is very unique. Venus is like no other planet; but if it is so dangerous, why do scientists want to find out more about it? Astronomers are interested in Venus because there is a possibility that Venus was the most Earth-like planet in the solar system years ago.

To start off, even though Venus is very dangerous, exploring it would provide a lot of intreging information. With an atmosphere of nearly 97 percent carbon dioxide and 800 degrees Fahrenheit, scientists are already trying to find out more, but they are not sure how, without having to be on the rocky yet toxic surface. ""Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape""(5). If NASA can put the blimp tactic in motion, scientists can start getting a much more magnified look at the mysterious planet. Even if the danger is extremely high, one scientist one of these days eventually is going to try to explore and find out more amazing facts and imformation about Venus. So why wait now?

In addition, exploring Venus would be worth it because of it's uniqueness. If any group of scientists were to go on a safe trip to observe the Evening Star it will probably be the most memorable day of their lives. Because there is nothing like Venus.

""Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us""(2). This shows that scientits have already attempted to learn more about the mystery planet, but haven't been very succesful. These scientists need to take flight. The only way that they will be able to get as close as possible and get the most accurate and approximate information is by being inside an aircraft hovering above the gasous planet. If the practices are completely correctly and safely and all of the precautions are met, there shouldn't be a problem with trained professionals to take on the unique ball of gas.

In conclusion, Venus is a mysterious planet that needs some research to figure out all of the different functions it has. And it's purpose for our world and solar system, because if it didn't have a purpose, it would't be in our galaxy. Studying Venus is definetly worth the risk because there is so much information that scientists could use to their advantage and to truly see how unique this planet really is.",0
"Everyone makes millions of choices in his or her lifetime. While making these choices, it is not uncommon for one to ask others for advice. Often, one will consult multiple people. It is always an excellent idea to receive multiple opinions when one is making an important choice or decision because this gives one an open mind to all methods and ideas, lets one know what the most reliable choices are based on how many have suggested them, and all while still allowing the decision-maker to choose the best option for himself.

Consulting multiple people for ideas and suggestions allows one to have an open mind when considering every different method. This can be evidenced by my own experience. One time, I had to decide what to get with money I had received for my birthday. I knew I wanted clothes, but I could not decide which kind. I believed it would always be practical to buy uniforms for school. However, my friends suggested I purchased clothing such as merchandise, sportswear, accessories, even things that were not clothes! All of these suggestions baffled me at first, but then i realized they were actually fantastic ideas! Ultimately, I decided to compare every suggestion I received and decide what to spend my money on based off of that. I realized that buying uniforms would be a bit of a waste and that I already had plenty, whereas there was a bit of a dearth when it came to clothes I actually enjoyed wearing. Without my friends, I never would have realized that! Ultimately, I ended up purchasing whatever clothes made me happy, such as those I found aesthetically pleasing and those that reminded me of things I enjoy. Despite thinking it was impractical at first, I am still very pleased with my choice and I never would have made it without the consultation I got from others.

Taking advice from others also shows which method of action holds the best results. For example, a few years ago, I needed to decide which middle school to attend. All of my friends were going to different schools, so i did not know what to do. I decided to look into the schools themselves rather than which ones my friends were attending. I looked for a school that met my personal standards and one that adults I know can tell me about. A lot of people told me that Generic_School was in my best interest and most closely fit the criteria I was looking for. They told me about the positives and negatives of it and compared it to other schools. It took me a while to make the decision, but I am glad I did. No school is perfect but I believe that this one was the best for me. This proves that recommendations are always good things to take into consideration when making an important decision.

Receiving multiple opinions is also wise because it gives insight on other people's perspectives while still allowing the decision-maker to make the choice that works best for him or her. An example of this is one that comes from my own experience. When deciding what to do this summer, I was given three options. I had to decide between traveling to West Virginia, traveling to Colorado, or staying here in Virginia and attending the Generic_School. My sister reminded me that going to West Virginia has not been pleasant for the two of us in the because never had anything to do. Then, my mom reminded me that going to Colorado means I will have to stay with my grandmother, who may try to convince me to call my father. Lastly, one of my friends suggested I attend Generic_School because I will have friends going there and I will be given the chance to improve my art. In the end, I decided I would like to travel to Colorado. Even with the possible downside, Colorado is my favorite place and I would be happy to return again, as I have not been there in years. The guidance from others helped me make my decision, but it was still up to me, and I am happy I was given the option to travel where I would like.

In conclusion, getting multiple opinions on decisions before making them is never a bad idea. The things I believe, such as that multiple opinions provide open-mindedness, multiple similar reccomendations can be reliable, and that listening to suggestions does not mean one needs to follow them, have made me believe that it is always practical to take other ideas into consideration and decide which option works best in whatever situation one is in.",0
"Today schools offer many tools or ways to complete your diary learning process. one of these tool is called ""school at home"" or ""distance learning"". Basicaly students can complete all their schoolworks and learning process at home through different methods like, in this case, the students attend classes form home by way of online or video cinferencing, but is it really good for the students?. Probably not.

It is know that students learn how to be sociable at school, and also they learn how to act at to many different social events or situations in the daily life. For example, we have a group of students, they are all the day working in a classroom with other students and friends that they knew at school; and we have a group of students that take ""school at home "", they do their school work in their houses and they just can socialice with they family at home. How can you learn how to be sociable without socialice with new people? different than your family ?. The answer is: you can't. Talk with new people improve you confidence and helps you to make new friends, and as students or young people, we do not used to try to talk with new people, because we are afraid, we don't have self-confidence, etc. and school force us to be social with our partners.

Moreover, some people claim that school is not a good way to improve your social abilities, but that people passed and important point and is that the school is the best way to improve your social abilities. For example, you (as a student) are working from monday to friday at least six hours per day with other students and teachers in different classrooms, the students aren't going to be the same in each classroom. All these factors made you get used to different personalities or behaviors of your teachers, friends, and classmates. School have to many different people with different behaviors that can help you to understand the way that people act and how to be their friend.

In addition, school teaches you how is going to be your life when you grow up and trains you for that. There are to many similarities between school and a job, for example: the schedule that makes you get use to the early woke ups, the homeworks that make you understand how long can be a job journey, and the teachers and students that represents your boss ans partners at work. All these examples of how school trains us for our future. Without all the training that the schools gave us, it would be a problem to get use to or daily life when we grow up.

All these reasons show us that school will benefit students more than ""school at home"" or ""distance learning"", because it teach us how to be sociable, it develops or social abilities, and it is a necessary part of our training for our adult life. In conclusion, school trains us as people, it teach us how to socialice and work.",0
"Did you know that over eighty percent of the population asks more than one person when they tend to ask questions? I believe that it is helpful to seek more then one person because one many people could have experienced it, two other people may have a different answer, and three I believe that it is a good idea to ask more than one person because they might just be wrong or right or they might have no clue what your talking about at all.

My reasons for my statements up above are one because that person may have experienced it and may just know what you are talking about. My reasons to support this are one if you simply ask more than one person you may get a better answer because they may or may not know what you are talking about, two if they experienced it they may not a lot about the topic and how they can help you, and my last statement about this is that if they experienced it rather than not at all you could always do research about it more and maybe asking more people could increase your social skills more. In conclusion to this paragraph I believe that you should always ask more than one person because they might just have a good feeling that they know what your talking about.

However, I also believe that as well as what I just said I think that you may get a better answer to support this is if you simply ask one person they might not even know at all, two you could always ask more and get a better answer and sum it up more to answer it, and finally, my last reason to support it is that one person you decided to ask might not even be right at all. In conclusion I believe that you should ask everyone because that one person might not be right plus you never know you may get a good answer.

My last reason to support this is that is you ask more than one person you could have a high chance of increasing you social skills by a lot, two if asking more people increases the chances of your answer actually being right, and finally it is always good t ask more than one person because they could have just honestly tell you a lot about it if it is something they know a lot about.

In conclusion,

I believe that it is never a bad idea to ask more than one person a question or and idea.

I believe the main idea or thesis of my topic is that it is a good idea to ask more than one person a opinion or an idea because they could just simply know more about it or they could just give a more honest opinion about it.

The lesson you can learn from this is that you should always ask more than one person about a question or just a simple opinion because they could honestly just know more depending on what your talking bout while if you just ask one person it can be just a twenty percent chance either they know it or not. You should listen to me about what I have to say because why would you risk the chance of just asking one person about a question they might not even know about at all? Or why even waste your time on something when you do not even know if they lied about it even being true or not or even knowing about it.

If you do not listen to me and just ask one person then good luck actually looking for the answer you want with only a twenty percent of someone even knowing what you are talking about or them not even giving you what you want or the correct answer. In conclusion, you should just really ask more than one person to get what you are really looking for and that might just improve some skills along with social skills.",0
"Dear State Senator, I have realized that there has been debate lately about if we should abolish the Electoral College or not. Reading about this, you could swing either way and have a valid point, but I think my way has more valid points and makes more sense as a whole picture. The key here is the bigger picture because if you look at a small flaw of something for long enough it eventually takes up the whole picture in your mind. You may have your opions about it and I have mine but I would like to share mine with you so you can see why the Electoral College is still important and should still be used.

When our founding fathers sat down and decided to right up our federal government system, they argued emensly on voting and how it should go about. when they finished bickering and developed this system, they made sure everything had a checks and balances type of layout. With the Electoral College, "" you vote for the electors and they vote for president and vice president, and then congress counts the electorsial votes"". This idea is more beneficial then just having a majority vote for obvious reasons. With the electorsal votes and populous votes it makes it harder to choose a president just by a single vote advantage.

Now I know your probably yelling at this letter saying the disaster factor is the main problem with the electorsial college but let me finish. there have only been two times that this has happened. ""It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes then bush yet fewer electorsal votes, but that was the first time since 1888"". If this has only happened twice then I think it is something that is fixable, but should not be the deciding factor that takes away the whole Electoral College system. The main reason we have this system is so there is a certainty of outcome and not just one score that is judged.

The way this is set up is so that ""no region has enough electorsal votes to elect a president"". This is a great thing because imagine if it was just majority vote the most populated states could just vote who they wanted to be president and it would be done. No other states would be able to compete and on top of that the candidates for president would only have to campaign in the populated states where they know they are already liked. The Electoral College is there so things aren't done in a jiffy. With this system the candidates actually have to work on trying to gain supporters in states where they may not be liked in. It also makes the American people think about all the options and decide on a bigger scale that requires more then just ""one vote"" to win an election.

Can you see why we need this Electoral College to stay and not just be abolished over like it is some plastic bottle on the highway that gets avoided and never gets picked up. We need people to stay actively involved in voting and I personally think the Electoral College does the best job with this. If the founding fathers spent months upon months just argueing about this single topic, I do not think they would just blow it off last second and come up with some giberish. If this system has worked this well this long then I think they must of done something right. Please consider my opinion state senator. ""Voters in presidental elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election"".",0
"I feel like the use of this technology being able to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not needed in anyway.

I feel this way because in the artical it stated that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" (Dr. Huang). That could be useful, the computer notices that the students are bored and some confused, and then it changes to now the students that were bored and confused, now are amused and understand it much better. But the normal teacher that we have already can do that to.

As an example a teacher notice when students are bored, and then swich it up a little so keep things somewhat fresh, and when students get confused, the teacher will do the exact same things, swich some of the lesson up and explain it more. Just like the computer.

As somewhat of a side note, it also feels more natural to be taught by a human. Because its someone who thinks the way you do, understandes you better because they have been through everthing school wise as you. If I had a choise to be taught by a computer or a teacher, I would pick the teacher because a computer might know everything there is to know, but it would make me feel in a way, safer, because I would be talking to a human, something everyone is used to doing.

Overall, I state that it is not valuable because the teacher can almost do the exact same thing as the computer. Yes, teachers maybe not be able to tell that you are 65% bored and 35% confused, but do we really need a computer to tell us this information, because I feel like it would be a waste of money and time, if its something humans can already do and have been doing much longer than any computer has, humans are not as exact as a computer, but we can help out a student, and recognize that the student is confused or bored, and much more. We can help the student, just like a computer.",0
"Some schools use cell phones in the classroom for educational purpose. People think it is a good idea for students to have phones for educational purpose. I believe students should not have phones in classrooms because students could easily get distracted, they will not have the chance to learn better, and having a phone should be a privilege.

First reason why I believe we should not have cell phones for educational purpose is ,students will get distracted. They will start using their phones for other purposes that are not educational or what their teacher has recommended. Students will start texting instead of doing their assigned work the teacher gave them. Students will start thinking it is okay for them to take out their phones when it is time for learning.

Second reason i believe it is wrong for students to have cell phones in classroom. Students will not have the chance to learn how it use to be. Students that actually take notes have a better chance to memorize what they learned and doing better in tests. When teachers do hands on work during class students can learn and teach their peers.

Last reason why i believe students should not have phones during class is ,phones are a privileged to have. Teachers should not allow phones during class time because students will not know when is the right time to have phones during class. Even if they put strict rules students will find a away to go around those rules.

In conclusion, this is why I believe some schools should not allow phones in classrooms. Students will get distracted, they will not get the chance to learn more, and having phones is a privilege. I believe schools should not allow students to use their phones during class.        ",0
"People ask for advice for any reason, especially when they can't decide. So why ask for multiple opinions? If I were to ask for advice I would go to multiple people and ask for their opinions. The reason why people ask for advice is to help come up with better inspiration or better ideas. Why they ask multiple people is to get better advice and different opinions on what they should do so they don't have to pick one certain idea.

Why should asking multiple people help with your decision? When you ask yourself for advice your brain may not be as open as other people. When I say that it means that all people think differently, for example many people have different beliefs and different ideas. Sometimes when asking different people you can come up with better advice or sometimes it can lead you to better advice. When you have multiple opinions it all could connect and you have your then you have really powerful and really good advice or it could just lead you to different places. But when you ask different people you realize the differences and different opinions that could help with your decision or take away from your decision. Certain people make good decisions and bad decisions but it's all up to that person to make one whether it is good or bad. If multiple people have enough evidence to support their advice, then that person would most likely choose their advice or add on to it.

What could help someone make a better choice? When someone makes a choice it could be good or bad depending on what they tell themselves or what other people tell them. When people ask for advice it would be really good to have evidence to support you advice. Asking multiple people would also make an impact because they all have different ideas and opinions on different things. But, when you ask certain people there could be a difference. For example, you could ask a really good friend for advice and then ask enemies that's what would make the difference because a friend would try to help you with good advice but when you ask enemies they wouldn't most likely do that. Another reason why asking certain people, is that you could be hanging around people who don't make good decisions and ask them for advice that wouldn't help you in a good way but, asking people that make good decisions would most likely give you good advice.

What is good advice? A lot of people ask for advice whether it's a friend, a relative, or a celebrity. When asking someone you know for advice doesn't mean it's good advice even though you have seen them on TV, you see them everyday,or you have seen them all your life. Good advice is when it benefits you in some way emotionally or physically. When someone gives you good advice it should be meaningful to you but, that doesn't always happen. When asking multiple people it sometimes builds up to make this really good piece of advice that could help you and other people in the world. People ask for advice for any reason and when they ask multiple people it helps them get different opinions of what to do and what not to do. When people do get good advice they seem to be a better person and understand how to give others really good advice.

Having good advice is really helpful from multiple people even though they aren't all the same. That's why people ask for advice is to help come up with better inspiration or better ideas. Also because they ask multiple people is to get better advice and different opinions on what they should do so they don't have to pick one certain idea that doesn't help them as much as getting other good advice ad using them all. So what's the purpose of asking multiple people? It's just to help support and give better advice.",0
