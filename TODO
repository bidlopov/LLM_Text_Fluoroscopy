1) UI/console input to choose between static and dynamic alrogythm (merge fixed and not-fixed scripts)
2) Make it possible to input not only .csv but .txt to classify. MLP will still learn on .csv???
3) Make sure that using other (bigger) GTE-type model will still lead to correct behaviour of MLP-classifier
